# CMPM202 classProject 
## about: 
This project includes two parts,  a recurrent neural network, and an autoencoder modified for class purposes.
please see the descriptions below for both parts. 

## part1 - RNN and generating text 
In part one of the project, we implemented a recurrent neural network using tensorflow to generate text. We followed and modified the tutorial found at https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/sequences/text_generation

We ran the code with text pieces from various resources. including books and musicals
Sample generated text includes: 

* Lord of the rings book
* musicals ( Hamilton and wicked), 
* and a game of thrones. 

All text is formatted in a way that fits its category; as an example, we formatted Hamilton and Wicked lyrics to include characters between brackets and increased spacing between segments. 


### running the code: 


### Sample output: 
**Lord of the rings**

with Epoch 3, nonsical text was produced
