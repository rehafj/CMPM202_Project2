Aaron Burr, Sir

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[COMPANY]
1776. New York City

[HAMILTON]
Pardon me. Are you Aaron Burr, sir?

[BURR]
That depends. Who's asking?

[HAMILTON]
Oh, well, sure, sir
I'm Alexander Hamilton, I'm at your service, sir
I have been looking for you

[BURR]
I'm getting nervous

[HAMILTON]
Sir...
I heard your name at Princeton. I was seeking an accelerated course of study when I got sort of out of sorts with a buddy of yours. I may have punched him. It's a blur, sir. He handles the financials?

[BURR]
You punched the bursar

[HAMILTON]
Yes!
I wanted to do what you did. Graduate in two, then join the revolution. He looked at me like I was stupid, I'm not stupid

So how'd you do it? How'd you graduate so fast?

[BURR]
It was my parents' dying wish before they passed

[HAMILTON]
You're an orphan. Of course! I'm an orphan
God, I wish there was a war!
Then we could prove that we're worth more
Than anyone bargained for...

[BURR]
Can I buy you a drink?

[HAMILTON]
That would be nice

[BURR]
While we're talking, let me offer you some free advice
Talk less

[HAMILTON]
What?

[BURR]
Smile more

[HAMILTON]
Ha

[BURR]
Don't let them know what you're against or what you're for

[HAMILTON]
You can't be serious

[BURR]
You wanna get ahead?

[HAMILTON]
Yes

[BURR]
Fools who run their mouths off wind up dead

[LAURE]

Yo yo yo yo yo!
What time is it?

[LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
Show time!

[BURR]
...like I said...

[LAURE]

Show time! Show time! Yo!
I'm John Laurens in the place to be!
Two pints o' Sam Adams, but I'm workin' on three, uh!
Those redcoats don't want it with me!
Cuz I will pop chick-a pop these cops till I'm free!

[LAFAYETTE]
Oui oui, mon ami, je m'appelle Lafayette!
The Lancelot of the revolutionary set!
I came from afar just to say "Bonsoir!"
Tell the King "Casse toi!" Who's the best?
C'est moi!

[MULLIGAN]
Brrrah brraaah! I am Hercules Mulligan
Up in it, lovin' it, yes I heard ya mother said "Come again?"
Lock up ya daughters and horses, of course
It's hard to have intercourse over four sets of corsets...

[LAURE]

No more sex, pour me another brew, son!
Let's raise a couple more...

[LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
To the revolution!

[LAURE]

Well, if it ain't the prodigy of Princeton college!

[MULLIGAN]
Aaron Burr!

[LAURE]

Give us a verse, drop some knowledge!

[BURR]
Good luck with that] you're takin' a stand
You spit. I'm ‘a sit. We'll see where we land

[LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
Boooo!

[LAURE]

Burr, the revolution's imminent. What do you stall for?

[HAMILTON]
If you stand for nothing, Burr, what'll you fall for?
[LAURE]

Ooh
Who are you? [MULLIGAN]
Ooh

Who are you? [LAFAYETTE]
Ooh

Who are you?

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE/LAURE]

Ooh, who is this kid? What's he gonna do?

My Shot

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[HAMILTON]
I am not throwing away my shot!
I am not throwing away my shot!
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot!
I'm ‘a get a scholarship to King's College
I prob'ly shouldn't brag, but dag, I amaze and astonish
The problem is I got a lot of brains but no polish
I gotta holler just to be heard
With every word, I drop knowledge!
I'm a diamond in the rough, a shiny piece of coal
Tryin' to reach my goal. My power of speech] unimpeachable
Only nineteen but my mind is older
These New York City streets get colder, I shoulder
Ev'ry burden, ev'ry disadvantage
I have learned to manage, I don't have a gun to brandish
I walk these streets famished
The plan is to fan this spark into a flame
But damn, it's getting dark, so let me spell out the name
I am the-

[HAMILTON/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN/LAURE]

A-L-E-X-A-N-D
E-R-we are-meant to be...

[HAMILTON]
A colony that runs independently
Meanwhile, Britain keeps shittin' on us endlessly
Essentially, they tax us relentlessly
Then King George turns around, runs a spending spree
He ain't ever gonna set his descendants free
So there will be a revolution in this century
Enter me!

[LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN/LAURE]

(He says in parentheses)

[HAMILTON]
Don't be shocked when your hist'ry book mentions me
I will lay down my life if it sets us free
Eventually, you'll see my ascendancy
[HAMILTON]
And I am not throwing away
My shot
I am not throwing away
My shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot
[LAURE]

My shot!

My shot!

And I'm not throwing away my shot.

[HAMILTON/MULLIGAN/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE]
I am not throwing away my shot
I am not throwing away my shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot
It's time to take a shot!

[LAFAYETTE]
I dream of life without a monarchy
The unrest in France will lead to ‘onarchy?
‘Onarchy? How you say, how you say, ‘anarchy?'
When I fight, I make the other side panicky
With my-

[HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
Shot!

[MULLIGAN]
Yo, I'm a tailor's apprentice
And I got y'all knuckleheads in loco parentis
I'm joining the rebellion cuz I know it's my chance
To socially advance, instead of sewin' some pants!
I'm gonna take a-

[HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
Shot!

[LAURE]

But we'll never be truly free
Until those in bondage have the same rights as you and me
You and I. Do or die. Wait till I sally in
On a stallion with the first black battalion
Have another-

[HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
Shot!

[BURR]
Geniuses, lower your voices
You keep out of trouble and you double your choices
I'm with you, but the situation is fraught
You've got to be carefully taught]
If you talk, you're gonna get shot!

[HAMILTON]
Burr, check what we got
Mister Lafayette, hard rock like Lancelot
I think your pants look hot
Laurens, I like you a lot
Let's hatch a plot blacker than the kettle callin' the pot...
What are the odds the gods would put us all in one spot
Poppin' a squat on conventional wisdom, like it or not
A bunch of revolutionary manumission abolitionists?
Give me a position, show me where the ammunition is!

Oh, am I talkin' too loud?
Sometimes I get over excited, shoot off at the mouth
I never had a group of friends before
I promise that I'll make y'all proud

[LAURE]

Let's get this guy in front of a crowd

[HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN/ENSEMBLE]
I am not throwing away my shot
I am not throwing away my shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot

I am not throwing away my shot
I am not throwing away my shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot
[LAURE]

Ev'rybody sing]
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Hey!
Whoa!
Wooh!!

Ay, let ‘em hear ya!

Let's go!

I said shout it to the rooftops!

Rise up!
[COMPANY]
Whoa! Whoa!
Whoa!

Rise up!

[HAMILTON]
I imagine death so much it feels more like a memory
When's it gonna get me?
In my sleep? Seven feet ahead of me?
If I see it comin', do I run or do I let it be?
Is it like a beat without a melody?
See, I never thought I'd live past twenty
Where I come from some get half as many
Ask anybody why we livin' fast and we laugh, reach for a flask
We have to make this moment last, that's plenty

Scratch that
This is not a moment, it's the movement
Where all the hungriest brothers with
Something to prove went?
Foes oppose us, we take an honest stand
We roll like Moses, claimin' our promised land
And? If we win our independence?
‘Zat a guarantee of freedom for our descendants?
Or will the blood we shed begin an endless
Cycle of vengeance and death with no defendants?
I know the action in the street is excitin'
But Jesus, between all the bleedin' ‘n fightin'
I've been readin' ‘n writin'
We need to handle our financial situation
Are we a nation of states? What's the state of our nation?
I'm past patiently waitin'. I'm passionately
Smashin' every expectation
Every action's an act of creation!
I'm laughin' in the face of casualties and sorrow
For the first time, I'm thinkin' past tomorrow

[HAMILTON AND COMPANY]
And I am not throwing away my shot
I am not throwing away my shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry

Farmer Refuted

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[SEABURY]
Hear ye, hear ye! My name is Samuel Seabury
And I present "Free Thoughts on the
Proceedings of the Continental Congress!"
Heed not the rabble who scream revolution
They have not your interests at heart

[MULLIGAN]
Oh my God. Tear this dude apart

[SEABURY]
Chaos and bloodshed are not a solution
Don't let them lead you astray
This Congress does not speak for me

[BURR]
Let him be

[SEABURY]
They're playing a dangerous game
I pray the king shows you his mercy
For shame, for shame...
[HAMILTON]
Yo!
He'd have you all unravel at the
Sound of screams but the
Revolution is comin'
The have-nots are gonna
Win this
It's hard to listen to you with a straight face

Chaos and bloodshed already haunt us, honestly you shouldn't even talk. And what about Boston? Look at the cost, n' all that we've lost n' you talk
About Congress?!

My dog speaks more eloquently than thee!

But strangely, your mange is the same

Is he in Jersey?

For the revolution!
[SEABURY]
Heed not the rabble
Who scream
Revolution, they
Have not your
Interests
At heart

Chaos and bloodshed are
Not a
Solution. Don't
Let them lead you
Astray
This Congress does not
Speak for me

They're playing a dangerous game

I pray the king shows you his mercy

For shame

For shame,

[COMPANY]
For the revolution!

[SEABURY]
Heed-

If you repeat yourself again I'm gonna-

Scream-

Honestly, look at me, please don't read!

[SEABURY]
Not your interests-

Don't modulate the key then not debate with me!
Why should a tiny island across the sea regulate the price of tea?

[BURR]
Alexander, please!

You'll Be Back

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[KING GEORGE]
You say
The price of my love's not a price that you're willing to pay
You cry
In your tea which you hurl in the sea when you see me go by
Why so sad?
Remember we made an arrangement when you went away
Now you're making me mad
Remember, despite our estrangement, I'm your man
You'll be back
Soon you'll see
You'll remember you belong to me
You'll be back
Time will tell
You'll remember that I served you well
Oceans rise
Empires fall
We have seen each other through it all
And when push
Comes to shove
I will send a fully armed battalion
To remind you of my love!

Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da
Da da dat dat da ya da!
Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da
Da da dat dat da...

You say our love is draining and you can't go on
You'll be the one complaining when I am gone...
And no, don't change the subject
Cuz you're my favorite subject
My sweet, submissive subject
My loyal, royal subject
Forever and ever and ever and ever and ever...

You'll be back
Like before
I will fight the fight and win the war
For your love
For your praise
And I'll love you till my dying days
When you're gone
I'll go mad
So don't throw away this thing we had

Cuz when push comes to shove
I will kill your friends and family to remind you of my love
Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da
Da da dat dat da ya da!
Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da
Da da dat-
Everybody!

[ENSEMBLE]
Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da
Da da dat dat da ya da!

Buck, buck, buck, buck, buck!

[WASHINGTON]
Check it-
Can I be real a second?
For just a millisecond?
Let down my guard and tell the people how I feel a second?
Now I'm the model of a modern major general
The venerated Virginian veteran whose men are all
Lining up, to put me up on a pedestal
Writin' letters to relatives
Embellishin' my elegance and eloquence
But the elephant is in the room
The truth is in ya face when ya hear the British cannons go...

[ENSEMBLE]
Boom!

[WASHINGTON]
Any hope of success is fleeting
How can I keep leading when the people I'm
Leading keep retreating?
We put a stop to the bleeding as the British take Brooklyn
Knight takes rook, but look

We are outgunned

Outmanned

Outnumbered
Outplanned

We gotta make an all out stand
Ayo, I'm gonna need a right-hand man

We gotta run to Harlem quick, we can't afford another slip
Guns and horses giddyup
I decide to divvy up
My forces, they're skittish as the British cut the city up
This close to giving up, facing mad scrutiny
I scream in the face of this mass mutiny]
Are these the men with which I am to defend America?
We ride at midnight, Manhattan in the distance
I cannot be everywhere at once, people
I'm in dire need of assistance...

[BURR]
Your excellency, sir!

[WASHINGTON]
Who are you?

[BURR]
Aaron Burr, Sir?
Permission to state my case?

[WASHINGTON]
As you were

[BURR]
Sir
I was a captain under General Montgomery
Until he caught a bullet in the neck in Quebec
And well, in summary
I think that I could be of some assistance
I admire how you keep firing on the British
From a distance

[WASHINGTON]
Huh

[BURR]
I have some questions, a couple of suggestions on how to fight instead of fleeing west

[WASHINGTON]
Yes?

[BURR]
Well-

[HAMILTON]
Your excellency, you wanted to see me?

[WASHINGTON]
Hamilton, come in, have you met Burr?

[HAMILTON]
Yes, sir

[HAMILTON AND BURR]
We keep meeting

[BURR]
As I was saying, sir, I look forward to seeing your strategy play out

[WASHINGTON]
Burr?

[BURR]
Sir?

[WASHINGTON]
Close the door on your way out

[HAMILTON]
Have I done something wrong, sir?

[WASHINGTON]
On the contrary
I called you here because our odds are beyond scary
Your reputation precedes you, but I have to laugh

[HAMILTON]
Sir?

[WASHINGTON]
Hamilton, how come no one can get you on their staff?

[HAMILTON]
Sir!

[WASHINGTON]
Don't get me wrong, you're a young man, of great renown
I know you stole British cannons when we were still downtown
Nathaniel Green and Henry Knox wanted to hire you...

[HAMILTON]
To be their Secretary? I don't think so

[WASHINGTON]
Why're you upset?

[HAMILTON]
I'm not-

[WASHINGTON]
It's alright, you want to fight, you've got a hunger
I was just like you when I was younger
Head full of fantasies of dyin' like a martyr?

[HAMILTON]
Yes

[WASHINGTON]
Dying is easy, young man. Living is harder

[HAMILTON]
Why are you telling me this?

[WASHINGTON]
I'm being honest
I'm working with a third of what our Congress has promised
We are a powder keg about to explode
I need someone like you to lighten the load. So?

[COMPANY (EXCEPT HAMILTON)]
I am not throwin' away my shot!
I am not throwin' away my shot!
Ayo, I'm just like my country, I'm young
Scrappy and hungry!

[HAMILTON]
I am not throwing away my shot!

[WASHINGTON]
Son

[WASHINGON AND COMPANY]
We are outgunned, outmanned!

[HAMILTON]
You need all the help you can get
I have some friends. Laurens, Mulligan
Marquis de Lafayette, okay, what else?

[WASHINGTON AND COMPANY]
Outnumbered, outplanned!

[HAMILTON]
We'll need some spies on the inside
Some King's men who might let some things slide
[HAMILTON]
I'll write to Congress and tell ‘em we need supplies, you rally the guys, master the element of surprise

I'll rise above my station, organize your information, ‘til we rise to the occasion of our new nation. Sir!

[ENSEMBLE]
Here comes the General!

[HAMILTON]
Rise up!

[HAMILTON]
Rise up!

[ENSEMBLE]
Here comes the General!

[HAMILTON]

A Winter's Ball

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[BURR]
How does the bastard, orphan, son of a whore
Go on and on
Grow into more of a phenomenon?
Watch this obnoxious, arrogant, loudmouth bother
Be seated at the right hand of the father
Washington hires Hamilton right on sight
But Hamilton still wants to fight, not write
Now Hamilton's skill with a quill is undeniable
But what do we have in common? We're
Reliable with the

[ALL MEN]
Ladies!

[BURR]
There are so many to deflower!

[ALL MEN]
Ladies!

[BURR]
Looks! Proximity to power

[ALL MEN]
Ladies!

[BURR]
They delighted and distracted him
Martha Washington named her feral tomcat after him!

[HAMILTON]
That's true

[FULL COMPANY]
1780

[BURR]
A winter's ball
And the Schuyler sisters are the envy of all
Yo, if you can marry a sister, you're rich, son

[HAMILTON]
Is it a question of if, Burr, or which one?

Helpless

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[HAMILTON/BURR/LAURENS/ALL WOMEN (EXCEPT ELIZA)]
Hey hey hey hey

Ohh, I do I do I do I
Dooo! Hey!
Ohh, I do I do I do I
Dooo! Boy you got me [ALL WOMEN]
Hey hey hey hey
Hey hey hey hey
Hey hey hey hey
Hey hey hey

[ELIZA AND WOMEN]
Helpless!
Look into your eyes, and the sky's the limit I'm helpless!
Down for the count, and I'm drownin' in ‘em

[ELIZA]
I have never been the type to try and grab the spotlight
We were at a revel with some rebels on a hot night
Laughin' at my sister as she's dazzling the room
Then you walked in and my heart went "Boom!"
Tryin' to catch your eye from the side of the ballroom
Everybody's dancin' and the band's top volume

[ELIZA AND WOMEN]
Grind to the rhythm as we wine and dine
[ELIZA]
Grab my sister, and
Whisper, "Yo, this
One's mine."

My sister made her way across the room to you
And I got nervous, thinking "What's she gonna do?"
She grabbed you by the arm, I'm thinkin' "I'm through"
Then you look back at me and suddenly I'm
Helpless!

Oh, look at those eyes

Oh!
Yeah, I'm
Helpless, I know

I'm so into you
I am so into you

I know I'm down for the count
And I'm drownin' in ‘em.

[ALL WOMEN]
Oooh

Oooh

Oooh

Oooh

Helpless!

Look into your eyes
And the sky's the limit
I'm
Helpless!
Down for the count
And I'm drownin' in ‘em

I'm helpless!

Look into your eyes
And the sky's the limit I'm helpless!

Down for the count
And I'm drownin' in ‘em.

[HAMILTON]
Where are you taking me?

[ANGELICA]
I'm about to change your life

[HAMILTON]
Then by all means, lead the way

[ELIZA]
Elizabeth Schuyler. It's a pleasure to meet you

[HAMILTON]
Schuyler?

[ANGELICA]
My sister

[ELIZA]
Thank you for all your service

[HAMILTON]
If it takes fighting a war for us to meet, it will have been worth it

[ANGELICA]
I'll leave you to it

[ELIZA AND WOMEN]
One week later

[ELIZA]
I'm writin' a letter nightly
Now my life gets better, every letter that you write me
Laughin' at my sister, cuz she wants to form a harem

[ANGELICA]
I'm just sayin', if you really loved me, you would share him
[ELIZA]
Ha!
Two weeks later
In the living room stressin'
My father's stone-faced
While you're asking for his blessin'
I'm dying inside, as
You wine
And dine
And I'm tryin' not to cry
‘cause there's nothing that your mind can't do
My father makes his way across the room
To you
I panic for a second, thinking
"we're through"
But then he shakes your hand and says
"Be true"
And you turn back to me, smiling, and I'm
Helpless!

Helpless!
Hoo!

That boy is mine
That boy is mine!

Helpless! Helpless!
Down for the count
And I'm drownin' in em

[ALL WOMEN]
Stressin'

Blessin'

Look into your eyes
And the sky's the
Limit I'm
Helpless!
Down for the count
And I'm drownin' in em

[HAMILTON]
Eliza, I don't have a dollar to my name
An acre of land, a troop to command, a dollop of fame
All I have's my honor, a tolerance for pain
A couple of college credits and my top-notch brain
Insane, your family brings out a different side of me
Peggy confides in me, Angelica tried to take a bite of me
No stress, my love for you is never in doubt
We'll get a little place in Harlem and we'll figure it out
I've been livin' without a family since I was a child
My father left, my mother died, I grew up buckwild
But I'll never forget my mother's face, that was real
And long as I'm alive, Eliza, swear to God
You'll never feel so...

[HAMILTON]
Eliza...

I've never felt so-

My life is gon' be fine cuz Eliza's in it.
[ELIZA]
I do I do I do I do!

I do I do I do I do!

Hey, yeah, yeah!

I'm down for the count
I'm-

I look into your eyes, and the sky's the limit
I'm

...drownin' in ‘em. [ALL WOMEN]
Helpless!

Helpless!

Helpless!

Down for the count
And I'm drownin' in ‘em

Satisfied

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[LAURE]

Alright, alright. That's what I'm talkin' about!
Now everyone give it up for the maid of honor
Angelica Schuyler!
[ANGELICA]
A toast to the groom!

To the bride!

From your sister

Who is always by your side

To your union

And the hope that you provide

May you always...

Be satisfied.

[ALL MEN]
To the groom!
To the groom!
To the groom!

To the bride!
To the bride!

Angelica!
Angelica!
Angelica!

By your side!

To the union!
To the revolution!

You provide!
You provide!

[HAMILTON AND MEN]
Always-

Rewind-

[ALL WOMEN]
To the groom!

To the bride!

To the bride!

[ELIZA AND WOMEN]
Angelica!

By your side!

To the union!
To the revolution!

You provide!

Always-

Rewind-

[ANGELICA]
I remember that night, I just might
Regret that night for the rest of my days

I remember those soldier boys
Tripping over themselves to win our praise

I remember that dreamlike candlelight
Like a dream that you can't quite place

But Alexander, I'll never forget the first
Time I saw your face

I have never been the same
Intelligent eyes in a hunger-pang frame
And when you said "Hi," I forgot my dang name
Set my heart aflame, ev'ry part aflame

[FULL COMPANY]
This is not a game...

[HAMILTON]
You strike me as a woman who has never been satisfied

[ANGELICA]
I'm sure I don't know what you mean. You forget yourself

[HAMILTON]
You're like me. I'm never satisfied

[ANGELICA]
Is that right?

[HAMILTON]
I have never been satisfied

[ANGELICA]
My name is Angelica Schuyler

[HAMILTON]
Alexander Hamilton

[ANGELICA]
Where's your fam'ly from?

[HAMILTON]
Unimportant. There's a million things I haven't done but
Just you wait, just you wait...

[ANGELICA]
So so so-
So this is what it feels like to match wits
With someone at your level! What the hell is the catch? It's
The feeling of freedom, of seein' the light
It's Ben Franklin with a key and a kite! You see it, right?
The conversation lasted two minutes, maybe three minutes
Ev'rything we said in total agreement, it's
A dream and it's a bit of a dance
A bit of a posture, it's a bit of a stance. He's a
Bit of a flirt, but I'm ‘a give it a chance
I asked about his fam'ly, did you see his answer?
His hands started fidgeting, he looked askance?
He's penniless, he's flying by the seat of his pants

Handsome, boy, does he know it!
Peach fuzz, and he can't even grow it!
I wanna take him far away from this place
Then I turn and see my sister's face and she is...

[ELIZA]
Helpless...

[ANGELICA]
And I know she is...

[ELIZA]
Helpless...

[ANGELICA]
And her eyes are just...

[ELIZA]
Helpless...

[ANGELICA]
And I realize

[ANGELICA AND COMPANY]
Three fundamental truths at the exact same time...

[HAMILTON]
Where are you taking me?

[ANGELICA]
I'm about to change your life

[HAMILTON]
Then by all means, lead the way

[COMPANY (EXCEPT ANGELICA)]
Number one!

[ANGELICA]
I'm a girl in a world in which
My only job is to marry rich
My father has no sons so I'm the one
Who has to social climb for one
So I'm the oldest and the wittiest and the gossip in
New York City is insidious
Alexander is penniless
Ha! That doesn't mean I want him any less

[ELIZA]
Elizabeth Schuyler. It's a pleasure to meet you

[HAMILTON]
Schuyler?

[ANGELICA]
My sister

[COMPANY]
Number two!

[ANGELICA]
He's after me cuz I'm a Schuyler sister
That elevates his status, I'd
Have to be naïve to set that aside
Maybe that is why I introduce him to Eliza
Now that's his bride
Nice going, Angelica, he was right
You will never be satisfied

[ELIZA]
Thank you for all your service

[HAMILTON]
If it takes fighting a war for us to meet, it will have been worth it

[ANGELICA]
I'll leave you to it

[COMPANY]
Number three!

[ANGELICA]
I know my sister like I know my own mind
You will never find anyone as trusting or as kind
If I tell her that I love him she'd be silently resigned
He'd be mine
She would say, "I'm fine"

[ANGELICA AND COMPANY]
She'd be lying

[ANGELICA]
But when I fantasize at night
It's Alexander's eyes
As I romanticize what might
Have been if I hadn't sized him
Up so quickly
At least my dear Eliza's his wife;
At least I keep his eyes in my life...
[ANGELICA]
To the groom!

To the bride!

From your sister

Who is always by your side

To your union

And the hope that you provide

May you always

Be satisfied

And I know

She'll be happy as

His bride
And I know [ALL MEN (EXCEPT HAMILTON)]
To the groom!
To the groom!
To the groom!

To the bride!
To the bride!

Angelica!
Angelica!

By your side

To the union!
To the revolution!

You provide!
You provide!

[HAMILTON AND MEN]
Always-

Be satisfied

Be satisfied

[MEN]
Be satisfied
Be satisfied
Be satisfied
Be satisfied

Be satisfied
Be satisfied

Be satisfied
Be satisfied
Be satisfied
Be satisfied.

[ALL WOMEN (EXCEPT ELIZA)]
To the groom!

To the bride!

To the bride!

[ELIZA AND WOMEN]
Angelica!

By your side

To the union!
To the revolution!

You provide!

Always-

Be satisfied

[WOMEN]
Be satisfied

Be satisfied

Be satisfied.

[ANGELICA]
He will never be satisfied
I will never be satisfied

The Story of Tonight (Reprise)

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[LAURE]

I may not live to see our glory!

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE]
I may not live to see our glory!

[LAURE]

But I've seen wonders great and small

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE]
I've seen wonders great and small

[LAURE]

‘Cause if the tomcat can get married

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE]
If Alexander can get married-

[LAURE]

There's hope for our ass, after all!

[LAFAYETTE]
Raise a glass to freedom

[LAURENS/MULLIGAN]
Hey!
Something you will never see again!

[MULLIGAN]
No matter what she tells you

[LAFAYETTE]
Let's have another round tonight!

[LAURE]

Raise a glass to the four of us!

[LAFAYETTE/HAMILTON]
Ho!

[MULLIGAN]
To the newly not poor of us!

[LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/HAMILTON]
Woo!

[LAFAYETTE]
We'll tell the story of tonight

[LAURE]

Let's have another round-

[HAMILTON]
Well, if it isn't Aaron Burr

[BURR]
Sir!

[HAMILTON]
I didn't think that you would make it

[BURR]
To be sure

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE]
Burr!

[BURR]
I came to say congratulations

[MULLIGAN]
Spit a verse, Burr!

[BURR]
I see the whole gang is here

[LAFAYETTE]
You are the worst, Burr!

[HAMILTON]
Ignore them. Congrats to you, Lieutenant Colonel
I wish I had your command instead of manning George's journal

[BURR]
No, you don't

[HAMILTON]
Yes, I do

[BURR]
Now, be sensible
From what I hear, you've made yourself indispensable

[LAURE]

Well, well, I heard
You've got a special someone on the side, Burr

[HAMILTON]
Is that so?

[LAURE]

What are you tryin' to hide, Burr?

[BURR]
I should go

[HAMILTON]
No, these guys should go

[LAFAYETTE]
What?

[LAURE]

No!

[HAMILTON]
Leave us alone

[MULLIGAN]
Man...

[HAMILTON]
It's alright, Burr. I wish you'd brought this girl with you tonight, Burr

[BURR]
You're very kind, but I'm afraid it's unlawful, sir

[HAMILTON]
What do you mean?

[BURR]
She's married

[HAMILTON]
I see

[BURR]
She's married to a British officer

[HAMILTON]
Oh shit...

[BURR]
Congrats again, Alexander. Smile more
I'll see you on the other side of the war

[HAMILTON]
I will never understand you
If you love this woman, go get her! What are you waiting for?

[BURR]
I'll see you on the other side of the war

[HAMILTON]
I'll see you on the other side of the war

Wait For It

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[BURR]
Theodosia writes me a letter everyday
I'm keeping the bed warm while her husband is away
He's on the British side in Georgia
He's trying to keep the colonies in line
But he can keep all of Georgia
Theodosia, she's mine

Love doesn't discriminate
Between the sinners
And the saints
It takes and it takes and it takes
And we keep loving anyway
We laugh and we cry
And we break
And we make our mistakes
And if there's a reason I'm by her side
When so many have tried
Then I'm willing to wait for it
I'm willing to wait for it
[BURR]
My grandfather was a fire and brimstone preacher

But there are things that the
Homilies and hymns won't teach ya

My mother was a genius

My father commanded respect

When they died they left no instructions
Just a legacy to protect

[MEN]
Preacher, preacher
Preacher

Teach ya, teach ya, teach ya

Respect, respect

[WOMEN]
Genius


[LAURE]

GOOD NEWS, SHE'S DEAD!
THE WITCH OF THE WEST IS DEAD!
THE WICKEDEST WITCH THERE EVER WAS,
THE ENEMY OF ALL OF US HERE IN [,
IS DEAD! GOOD NEWS! GOOD NEWS!

[LAURE]

Look, it's Glinda!


[LAURE]

floats in on a giant bubble

[LAURE]

 It's good to see me, isn't it? ([Ozians Agree) No need to respond that was rhetorical. Fellow [Ozia]


[BURR]
LET US BE GLAD,
LET US BE GRATEFUL,
LET US REJOICIFY THAT GOODNESS COULD SUBDUE
THE WICKED WORKINGS OF YOU KNOW WHO!
ISN'T IT NICE TO KNOW
THAT GOOD WILL CONQUER EVIL?
THE TRUTH WE ALL BELIEVE'LL BY AND BY
OUTLIVE A LIE
FOR YOU AND...

[BURR]
Glinda! Exactly how dead is she?

[[Burr] Well, there has been much rumor and speculation... innuendo, outuendo...
but let me set the record straight. According to the Time Dragon Clock, the melting occurred at the 13th hour;
a direct result of a bucket of water thrown by a female child. Yes, the Wicked Witch of the West is dead!

[Ozian]
NO ONE MOURNS THE WICKED!

[Ozian]
NO ONE CRIES THEY WON'T RETURN!

[Ozia]

NO ONE LAYS A LILY ON THEIR GRAVE!
[Ozian Man]
THE GOOD MAN SCORNS THE WICKED!
Women]
THROUGH THEIR LIVES OUR CHILDREN LEARN!

[Ozia]

WHAT WE MISS WHEN WE MISBEHAVE!
[Burr]
AND GOODNESS KNOWS
THE WICKEDS' LIVES ARE LONELY
GOODNESS KNOWS
THE WICKED DIE ALONE
IT JUST SHOWS WHEN YOU'RE WICKED
YOU'RE LEFT ONLY
ON YOUR OWN
[Ozia]

YES, GOODNESS KNOWS
THE WICKEDS' LIVES ARE LONELY
GOODNESS KNOWS
THE WICKED CRY ALONE
NOTHING GROWS FOR THE WICKED
THEY REAP ONLY
WHAT THEY'VE SEWN
[Ozian] Glinda, why does wickedness happen?
[Burr] That's a good question; one that many people find confusifying. Are people born wicked,
or do they have wickedness thrust upon them? After all, she had a childhood,;
She had a father, who just happed to be the governor of munchlinkland Witch's Parents Enter.

[Frex]
 I'm off to the assembly, dear.
[Burr] She had a mother, as so many do...
[Frex]

HOW I HATE TO GO AND LEAVE YOU LONELY
Melena]
THAT'S ALRIGH IT'S ONLY JUST ONE NIGHT
[Frex]

BUT KNOW THAT YOU'RE HERE, IN MY HEART
WHILE I'M OUT OF YOUR SIGHT!
Frex Exits. A Lover Runs Into The Room.
[Burr] And like all families, they had their secrets.
Lover]
HAVE ANOTHER DRINK, MY DARK EYED BEAUTY,
I'VE GOT ONE MORE NIGHT LEFT HERE IN TOWN,
SO HAVE ANOTHER DRINK OF GREEN ELIXER
AND WE'LL HAVE OURSELVES A LITTLE MIXER
HAVE ANOTHER LITTLE SWALLOW LITTLE LADY,
AND FOLLOW ME DOWN
[Burr] And of course, from the moment she was born she was... well... different!
Midwife] AHHH!! It's coming!
[Frex]
 Now?
Midwife] The baby's coming!
[Frex]
 And how!

Midwife]
I SEE A NOSE!
[Frex]

I SEE A CURL!
Both]
IT'S A HEALTHY, PERFECT, LOVELY LITTLE...

Melena] What is it? What's wrong?
Midwife]
HOW CAN IT BE?
[Frex]

WHAT DOES IT MEAN?
Midwife]
IT'S ATTROCIOUS!
[Frex]

IT'S OBSCENE!
Both]
LIKE A FROGGY, FERNY CABBAGE,
THE BABY IS UNATURALLY
GREEN!!!
[Frex]
 Take it away... Take it away!!!!
[Burr] So you see, it couldn't have been easy!

Munchki]

NO ONE MOURNS THE WICKED!
NOW AT LAST, SHE'S DEAD AND GONE!
NOW AT LAST THERE'S JOY THROUGHOUT THE LAND!
AND GOODNESS KNOWS (GOODNESS KNOWS)
WE KNOW WHAT GOODNESS IS (OOOOHHHH)
GOODNESS KNOWS, THE WICKED DIE ALONE (SHE DIED ALONE)
WOE TO THOSE (WOE TO THOSE)
WHO SPURN WHAT GOODNESSES THEY ARE SHOWN!
NO ONE MOURNS THE WICKED (GOOD NEWS)
NO ONE MOURNS THE WICKED (GOOD NEWS)
NO ONE MOURNS... THE WICKED...
WICKED...
WICKED!!!!!
[Burr] Well, this has been fun! But as you can imagine I have much to attend to,
what with the Wizard's unexpected departure. So, if there are no further questions...
[Ozian] Glinda, is it true you were her friend?
[Ozians Gasp
[Burr] Well, I... you see... um... yes.
Louder Gasps
[Burr] Well, it depends on what you mean by "friend". She Motions Her Bubble Downward.
I did know her. That is, our paths did cross... at school. But you must understand, it was a long time ago and we were both very young.

Okay, let's get this over with. No, I'm not seasick, yes, I've always been green, no, I didn't chew grass as a child.
[Frex]
 Elphaba!
[HAMILTON] Oh, this is my younger sister, Nessarose. As you can see, she is a perfectly normal color.

Mme. Morrible Enters
[Morrible]
 Welcome, new students! I am Madame Morrible, headmistress here, at Shiz University.
And whether you're here to study logic, literature, or linguification,
I know I speak for my fellow faculty members when I say we have nothing but the highest hopes for some of you.
Now, regarding room assignments... Elphaba & Galinda Raise Their Hands.
She Notices Galinda First. Yes, is this regarding room assignments?
[linda]

 Oh, Madame, thank you for asking, but I've already been assigned a private suite...
Noticing Her Followers' Disappointment. But you can all come visit me whenever you want!
Shen Shen] How good of you!
Pfanee] You are so good!
[linda]

 No I'm not!
Both] Yes you are!
[linda]

 Now stop! Swishes Her Hair.
[Morrible]
 Do you have a question?

[linda]

 Yes, you see, I am Galinda Upland of the Upperuplands... I've applied to your sorcery seminar,
and indeed that is my sole purpose of attending Shiz; to study sorcery with you.
Perhaps you recall my essay, "Magic Wands, Need They Have A Point".
[Morrible]
 Yes... However, I do not teach my seminar every semester, unless, of course, somebody special were to come along.
[linda]

 Well, exactly!
[HAMILTON] We have not yet received our room assignments.
[Morrible]
 Yes, yes, of course! Oh, You must be Miss Nessarose, the governor's daughter.
What a tragically beautiful face you have! Sees Elphaba, snorts...And you must be.
[HAMILTON] I'm the other daughter. Elphaba. I'm beautifully tragic.
[Morrible]
 Yes, yes, I'm sure you're very bright.
[linda]

 Bright? She's phosphorescent.
[Morrible]
 I don't seem to have you on my list. Oh, well a slight gulch, but not to fret! We'll find someplace to put you.
[linda]

 Y'know, I don't even think she read my essay.
Shen Shen] That's so unfair!
[Angelica]
 You should say something!
[linda]

 Should I?
Pfanee] Do it!
[Morrible]
 Now, which one of you young ladies would like to volunteer to share with Miss Elphaba?
[linda]

 Madame Morrible...
[Morrible]
 Thank you dear. Oh, how very good of you!
[linda]

 What?
[Morrible]
 Miss Elphaba, you may share with Miss Galinda.
[linda]

 Huh?
[Morrible]
 The governor made his concern for your sister's well being quite clear.
So, I thought it would be best if she share my private compartment where I can assist her as needed...
[HAMILTON] But Madame, I've always looked after my sister.
[Morrible]
 Everyone, to your dormitories.
[HAMILTON] But Madame...
[HAMILTON] Let her go!!!
Nessarose's Wheelchair Is Torn From Morrible's Hands And Begins To Wheel Itself Back To Elphaba.
[Morrible]
 How did you do that?
[linda]

 How did she do that?
[Angelica]
 Elphaba!
[Morrible]
 You mean this has happened before?
[HAMILTON] Uh... Something just comes over me sometimes... I'm sorry, Madame.
[Morrible]
 What? Never apologize for talent! Talent is a gift! Have you ever considered a career in sorcery?
[HAMILTON] Sorcery?
[Morrible]
 I shall tutor you myself, and take no other students.
[linda]

 What?
All Students But Galinda Exit.
[Morrible]
 Oh, Miss Elphaba...
MANY YEARS I HAVE WAITED
FOR A GIFT LIKE YOURS TO APPEAR
WHY I PREDICT THE WIZARD COULD MAKE YOU HIS
MAGIC, GRAND VIZIER!
MY DEAR, MY DEAR,
I'LL WRITE AT ONCE TO THE WIZARD
TELL HIM OF YOU IN ADVANCE
WITH A TALENT LIKE YOURS, DEAR, THERE IS
A DEFIN-ISH CHANCE
IF YOU WORK AS YOU SHOULD
YOU'LL BE MAKING GOOD
[linda]

 Madame Morrible...
[Morrible]
 No, not now dearest. She Exits.
[Burr] This will just make me a better person. She simles.
She Runs Off.

[HAMILTON]
DID THAT REALLY JUST HAPPEN?
HAVE I ACTUALLY UNDERSTOOD?
THIS WEIRD QUIRK I'VE TRIED TO SURPRESS OR HIDE
IS A TALENT THAT COULD HELP ME MEET THE WIZARD
IF I MAKE GOOD
SO I'LL MAKE GOOD.
WHEN I MEET THE WIZARD,
ONCE I PROVE MY WORTH,
AND THEN I MEET THE WIZARD,
WHAT I'VE WAITED FOR SINCE
SINCE BIRTH!
AND WITH ALL HIS WIZARD WISDOM
BY MY LOOKS HE WON'T BE BLINDED
DO YOU THINK THE WIZARD IS DUMB?
OR LIKE MUNCHKINS SO SMALL-MINDED? NO!
HE'LL SAY TO ME "I SEE WHO YOU TRULY ARE,
A GIRL ON WHOM I CAN RELY"
AND THAT'S HOW WE'LL BEGIN,
THE WIZARD AND I
ONCE I'M WITH THE WIZARD,
MY WHOLE LIFE WILL CHANGE,
'CUZ ONCE YOU'RE WITH THE WIZARD
NO ONE THINKS YOU'RE STRANGE
NO FATHER IS NOT PROUD OF YOU,
NO SISTER ACTS ASHAMED,
AND ALL OF OzHAS TO LOVE YOU
WHEN BY THE WIZARD YOU'RE ACLAIMED
AND THIS GIFT OR THIS CURSE
THAT I HAVE INSIDE
MAYBE AT LAST I'LL KNOW WHY
WHEN WE ARE HAND IN HAND,
THE WIZARD AND I
AND ONE DAY HE'LL SAY TO ME, "ELPHABA,
A GIRL WHO IS SO SUPERIOR,
SHOULDN'T A GIRL WHO'S SO GOOD INSIDE
HAVE A MATCHING EXTERIOR?
AND SINCE FOLKS HERE TO AN OBSURED DEGREE
SEEM FIXATED ON YOUR VERDEGRIS
WOULD IT BE ALRIGHT BY YOU
IF I DEGREENIFY YOU?"
AND OF COURSE THAT'S NOT IMPORTANT TO ME
"ALRIGHT! WHY NOT?" I'LL REPLY
OH, WHAT A PAIR WE'LL BE
THE WIZARD AND I
YES, WHAT A PAIR WE'LL BE
THE WIZARD AND...
UNLIMITED, MY FUTURE IS UNLIMITED
AND I'VE JUST HAD A VISION ALMOST LIKE A PROPHECY
I KNOW
IT SOUNDS TRULY CRAZY
AND TRUE, THE VISION'S HAZY
BUT I SWEAR SOME DAY THERE'LL BE
A CELEBRATION THROUGHOUT [Oz
THAT'S ALL TO DO
WITH ME!
AND I'LL STAND THERE WITH THE WIZARD
FEELING THINGS I'VE NEVER FELT
AND THOUGH I'D NEVER SHOW IT
I'D BE SO HAPPY I COULD MELT!
AND SO IT WILL BE FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE
AND I'LL WANT NOTHING ELSE 'TILL I DIE
HELD IN SUCH HIGH ESTEEM!
WHEN PEOPLE SEE ME THEY WILL SCREAM
FOR HALF OF [Oz'S FAVORITE TEAM]
THE WIZARD...
AND I!!!!

Aaron Burr, Sir

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[COMPANY]
1776. New York City

[HAMILTON]
Pardon me. Are you Aaron Burr, sir?

[BURR]
That depends. Who's asking?

[HAMILTON]
Oh, well, sure, sir
I'm Alexander Hamilton, I'm at your service, sir
I have been looking for you

[BURR]
I'm getting nervous

[HAMILTON]
Sir...
I heard your name at Princeton. I was seeking an accelerated course of study when I got sort of out of sorts with a buddy of yours. I may have punched him. It's a blur, sir. He handles the financials?

[BURR]
You punched the bursar

[HAMILTON]
Yes!
I wanted to do what you did. Graduate in two, then join the revolution. He looked at me like I was stupid, I'm not stupid

So how'd you do it? How'd you graduate so fast?

[BURR]
It was my parents' dying wish before they passed

[HAMILTON]
You're an orphan. Of course! I'm an orphan
God, I wish there was a war!
Then we could prove that we're worth more
Than anyone bargained for...

[BURR]
Can I buy you a drink?

[HAMILTON]
That would be nice

[BURR]
While we're talking, let me offer you some free advice
Talk less

[HAMILTON]
What?

[BURR]
Smile more

[HAMILTON]
Ha

[BURR]
Don't let them know what you're against or what you're for

[HAMILTON]
You can't be serious

[BURR]
You wanna get ahead?

[HAMILTON]
Yes

[BURR]
Fools who run their mouths off wind up dead

[LAURE]

Yo yo yo yo yo!
What time is it?

[LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
Show time!

[BURR]
...like I said...

[LAURE]

Show time! Show time! Yo!
I'm John Laurens in the place to be!
Two pints o' Sam Adams, but I'm workin' on three, uh!
Those redcoats don't want it with me!
Cuz I will pop chick-a pop these cops till I'm free!

[LAFAYETTE]
Oui oui, mon ami, je m'appelle Lafayette!
The Lancelot of the revolutionary set!
I came from afar just to say "Bonsoir!"
Tell the King "Casse toi!" Who's the best?
C'est moi!

[MULLIGAN]
Brrrah brraaah! I am Hercules Mulligan
Up in it, lovin' it, yes I heard ya mother said "Come again?"
Lock up ya daughters and horses, of course
It's hard to have intercourse over four sets of corsets...

[LAURE]

No more sex, pour me another brew, son!
Let's raise a couple more...

[LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
To the revolution!

[LAURE]

Well, if it ain't the prodigy of Princeton college!

[MULLIGAN]
Aaron Burr!

[LAURE]

Give us a verse, drop some knowledge!

[BURR]
Good luck with that] you're takin' a stand
You spit. I'm ‘a sit. We'll see where we land

[LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
Boooo!

[LAURE]

Burr, the revolution's imminent. What do you stall for?

[HAMILTON]
If you stand for nothing, Burr, what'll you fall for?
[LAURE]

Ooh
Who are you? [MULLIGAN]
Ooh

Ooh

Who are you?

My Shot

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[HAMILTON]
I am not throwing away my shot!
I am not throwing away my shot!
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot!
I'm ‘a get a scholarship to King's College
I prob'ly shouldn't brag, but dag, I amaze and astonish
The problem is I got a lot of brains but no polish
I gotta holler just to be heard
With every word, I drop knowledge!
I'm a diamond in the rough, a shiny piece of coal
Tryin' to reach my goal. My power of speech] unimpeachable
Only nineteen but my mind is older
These New York City streets get colder, I shoulder
Ev'ry burden, ev'ry disadvantage
I have learned to manage, I don't have a gun to brandish
I walk these streets famished
The plan is to fan this spark into a flame
But damn, it's getting dark, so let me spell out the name
I am the-

[HAMILTON/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN/LAURE]

A-L-E-X-A-N-D
E-R-we are-meant to be...

[HAMILTON]
A colony that runs independently
Meanwhile, Britain keeps shittin' on us endlessly
Essentially, they tax us relentlessly
Then King George turns around, runs a spending spree
He ain't ever gonna set his descendants free
So there will be a revolution in this century
Enter me!

[LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN/LAURE]

(He says in parentheses)

[HAMILTON]
Don't be shocked when your hist'ry book mentions me
I will lay down my life if it sets us free
Eventually, you'll see my ascendancy
[HAMILTON]
And I am not throwing away
My shot
I am not throwing away
My shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot
[LAURE]

My shot!

My shot!

And I'm not throwing away my shot.

[HAMILTON/MULLIGAN/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE]
I am not throwing away my shot
I am not throwing away my shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot
It's time to take a shot!

[LAFAYETTE]
I dream of life without a monarchy
The unrest in France will lead to ‘onarchy?
‘Onarchy? How you say, how you say, ‘anarchy?'
When I fight, I make the other side panicky
With my-

[HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
Shot!

[MULLIGAN]
Yo, I'm a tailor's apprentice
And I got y'all knuckleheads in loco parentis
I'm joining the rebellion cuz I know it's my chance
To socially advance, instead of sewin' some pants!
I'm gonna take a-

[HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
Shot!

[LAURE]

But we'll never be truly free
Until those in bondage have the same rights as you and me
You and I. Do or die. Wait till I sally in
On a stallion with the first black battalion
Have another-

[HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
Shot!

[BURR]
Geniuses, lower your voices
You keep out of trouble and you double your choices
I'm with you, but the situation is fraught
You've got to be carefully taught]
If you talk, you're gonna get shot!

[HAMILTON]
Burr, check what we got
Mister Lafayette, hard rock like Lancelot
I think your pants look hot
Laurens, I like you a lot
Let's hatch a plot blacker than the kettle callin' the pot...
What are the odds the gods would put us all in one spot
Poppin' a squat on conventional wisdom, like it or not
A bunch of revolutionary manumission abolitionists?
Give me a position, show me where the ammunition is!

Oh, am I talkin' too loud?
Sometimes I get over excited, shoot off at the mouth
I never had a group of friends before
I promise that I'll make y'all proud

[LAURE]

Let's get this guy in front of a crowd

[HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN/ENSEMBLE]
I am not throwing away my shot
I am not throwing away my shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot

I am not throwing away my shot
I am not throwing away my shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot
[LAURE]

Ev'rybody sing]
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Hey!
Whoa!
Wooh!!
Whoa!
Ay, let ‘em hear ya!

Let's go!

I said shout it to the rooftops!

When are these colonies gonna rise up?
When are these colonies gonna rise up?

Rise up!
[COMPANY]
Whoa! Whoa!

Rise up!

[HAMILTON]
I imagine death so much it feels more like a memory
When's it gonna get me?
In my sleep? Seven feet ahead of me?
If I see it comin', do I run or do I let it be?
Is it like a beat without a melody?
See, I never thought I'd live past twenty
Where I come from some get half as many
Ask anybody why we livin' fast and we laugh, reach for a flask
We have to make this moment last, that's plenty

Scratch that
This is not a moment, it's the movement
Where all the hungriest brothers with
Something to prove went?
Foes oppose us, we take an honest stand
We roll like Moses, claimin' our promised land
And? If we win our independence?
‘Zat a guarantee of freedom for our descendants?
Or will the blood we shed begin an endless
Cycle of vengeance and death with no defendants?
I know the action in the street is excitin'
But Jesus, between all the bleedin' ‘n fightin'
I've been readin' ‘n writin'
We need to handle our financial situation
Are we a nation of states? What's the state of our nation?
I'm past patiently waitin'. I'm passionately
Smashin' every expectation
Every action's an act of creation!
I'm laughin' in the face of casualties and sorrow
For the first time, I'm thinkin' past tomorrow

[HAMILTON AND COMPANY]
And I am not throwing away my shot
I am not throwing away my shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry

Hear ye, hear ye! My name is Samuel Seabury
And I present "Free Thoughts on the
Proceedings of the Continental Congress!"
Heed not the rabble who scream revolution
They have not your interests at heart

[MULLIGAN]
Oh my God. Tear this dude apart

[SEABURY]
Chaos and bloodshed are not a solution
Don't let them lead you astray
This Congress does not speak for me

[BURR]
Let him be

[SEABURY]
They're playing a dangerous game
I pray the king shows you his mercy
For shame, for shame...
[HAMILTON]
Yo!
He'd have you all unravel at the
Sound of screams but the
Revolution is comin'
The have-nots are gonna
Win this
It's hard to listen to you with a straight face

Chaos and bloodshed already haunt us, honestly you shouldn't even talk. And what about Boston? Look at the cost, n' all that we've lost n' you talk
About Congress?!

My dog speaks more eloquently than thee!

But strangely, your mange is the same

Is he in Jersey?

For the revolution!
[SEABURY]
Heed not the rabble
Who scream
Revolution, they
Have not your
Interests
At heart

Chaos and bloodshed are
Not a
Solution. Don't
Let them lead you
Astray
This Congress does not
Speak for me

They're playing a dangerous game

I pray the king shows you his mercy

For shame

For shame,

[COMPANY]
For the revolution!

[SEABURY]
Heed-

[HAMILTON]
If you repeat yourself again I'm gonna-

[SEABURY/HAMILTON]
Scream-

[HAMILTON]
Honestly, look at me, please don't read!

[SEABURY]
Not your interests-

[HAMILTON]
Don't modulate the key then not debate with me!
Why should a tiny island across the sea regulate the price of tea?

[BURR]
Alexander, please!

[HAMILTON]
Burr, I'd rather be divisive than indecisive, drop the niceties

[ENSEMBLE]
Silence! A message from the King!
A message from the King!

[FULL COMPANY]
A message from the King!

You'll Be Back

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[KING GEORGE]
You say
The price of my love's not a price that you're willing to pay
You cry
In your tea which you hurl in the sea when you see me go by
Why so sad?
Remember we made an arrangement when you went away
Now you're making me mad
Remember, despite our estrangement, I'm your man
You'll be back
Soon you'll see
You'll remember you belong to me
You'll be back
Time will tell
You'll remember that I served you well
Oceans rise
Empires fall
We have seen each other through it all
And when push
Comes to shove
I will send a fully armed battalion
To remind you of my love!

Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da
Da da dat dat da ya da!
Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da
Da da dat dat da...

You say our love is draining and you can't go on
You'll be the one complaining when I am gone...
And no, don't change the subject
Cuz you're my favorite subject
My sweet, submissive subject
My loyal, royal subject
Forever and ever and ever and ever and ever...

You'll be back
Like before
I will fight the fight and win the war
For your love
For your praise
And I'll love you till my dying days
When you're gone
I'll go mad
So don't throw away this thing we had

Cuz when push comes to shove
I will kill your friends and family to remind you of my love
Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da
Da da dat dat da ya da!
Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da
Da da dat-
Everybody!

[ENSEMBLE]
Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da
Da da dat dat da ya da!
Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da da da da
Dat dat da ya da!

British Admiral Howe's got troops on the water
Thirty-two thousand troops in New York harbor

[HAMILTON]
As a kid in the Caribbean I wished for a war
I knew that I was poor
I knew it was the only way to-

[HAMILTON/BURR/MULLIGAN/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE]
Rise up!

[HAMILTON]
If they tell my story
I am either gonna die on the battlefield in glory or-

[HAMILTON/BURR/MULLIGAN/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE]
Rise up!

[HAMILTON]
We will fight for this land
But there's only one man
Who can give us a command so we can-

[HAMILTON/BURR/MULLIGAN/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE]
Rise up!

[HAMILTON]
Understand? It's the only way to-

[HAMILTON/BURR/MULLIGAN/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE]

We are outgunned

Outmanned

Outplanned

We gotta make an all out stand
Ayo, I'm gonna need a right-hand man.
ENSEMBLE
What?

What?

Buck, buck, buck, buck, buck!

Buck, buck, buck, buck, buck!

[WASHINGTON]
Check it-
Can I be real a second?
For just a millisecond?
Let down my guard and tell the people how I feel a second?
Now I'm the model of a modern major general
The venerated Virginian veteran whose men are all
Lining up, to put me up on a pedestal
Writin' letters to relatives
Embellishin' my elegance and eloquence
But the elephant is in the room
The truth is in ya face when ya hear the British cannons go...

[ENSEMBLE]
Boom!

[WASHINGTON]
Any hope of success is fleeting
How can I keep leading when the people I'm
Leading keep retreating?
We put a stop to the bleeding as the British take Brooklyn
Knight takes rook, but look
[WASHINGTON]
We are outgunned

Outmanned

Outnumbered
Outplanned

We gotta make an all out stand
Ayo, I'm gonna need a right-hand man

Incoming!
[ENSEMBLE]
What?

What?

Buck, buck, buck, buck, buck!

Buck, buck, buck, buck, buck!

[HAMILTON]
They're battering down the Battery check the damages

[MULLIGAN]
Rah!

[HAMILTON]
We gotta stop ‘em and rob ‘em of their advantages

[MULLIGAN]
Rah!

[HAMILTON]
Let's take a stand with the stamina God has granted us
Hamilton won't abandon ship
Yo, let's steal their cannons-
[MULLIGAN]
Shh-boom! [COMPANY]
Boom!

[WASHINGTON]
Goes the cannon, watch the blood and the shit spray and...

[COMPANY]
Boom!

[WASHINGTON]
Goes the cannon, we're abandonin' Kips Bay and...

[COMPANY]
Boom!

[WASHINGTON]
There's another ship and...

[COMPANY]
Boom!

[WASHINGTON]
We just lost the southern tip and...

[COMPANY]
Boom!

[WASHINGTON]
We gotta run to Harlem quick, we can't afford another slip
Guns and horses giddyup
I decide to divvy up
My forces, they're skittish as the British cut the city up
This close to giving up, facing mad scrutiny
I scream in the face of this mass mutiny]
Are these the men with which I am to defend America?
We ride at midnight, Manhattan in the distance
I cannot be everywhere at once, people
I'm in dire need of assistance...

[BURR]
Your excellency, sir!

[WASHINGTON]
Who are you?

[BURR]
Aaron Burr, Sir?
Permission to state my case?

[WASHINGTON]
As you were

[BURR]
Sir
I was a captain under General Montgomery
Until he caught a bullet in the neck in Quebec
And well, in summary
I think that I could be of some assistance
I admire how you keep firing on the British
From a distance

[WASHINGTON]
Huh

[BURR]
I have some questions, a couple of suggestions on how to fight instead of fleeing west

[WASHINGTON]
Yes?

[BURR]
Well-

[HAMILTON]
Your excellency, you wanted to see me?

[WASHINGTON]
Hamilton, come in, have you met Burr?

[HAMILTON]
Yes, sir

[HAMILTON AND BURR]
We keep meeting

[BURR]
As I was saying, sir, I look forward to seeing your strategy play out

[WASHINGTON]
Burr?

[BURR]
Sir?

[WASHINGTON]
Close the door on your way out

[HAMILTON]
Have I done something wrong, sir?

[WASHINGTON]
On the contrary
I called you here because our odds are beyond scary
Your reputation precedes you, but I have to laugh

[HAMILTON]
Sir?

[WASHINGTON]
Hamilton, how come no one can get you on their staff?

[HAMILTON]
Sir!

[WASHINGTON]
Don't get me wrong, you're a young man, of great renown
I know you stole British cannons when we were still downtown
Nathaniel Green and Henry Knox wanted to hire you...

[HAMILTON]
To be their Secretary? I don't think so

[WASHINGTON]
Why're you upset?

[HAMILTON]
I'm not-

[WASHINGTON]
It's alright, you want to fight, you've got a hunger
I was just like you when I was younger
Head full of fantasies of dyin' like a martyr?

[HAMILTON]
Yes

[WASHINGTON]
Dying is easy, young man. Living is harder

[HAMILTON]
Why are you telling me this?

[WASHINGTON]
I'm being honest
I'm working with a third of what our Congress has promised
We are a powder keg about to explode
I need someone like you to lighten the load. So?

[COMPANY (EXCEPT HAMILTON)]
I am not throwin' away my shot!
I am not throwin' away my shot!
Ayo, I'm just like my country, I'm young
Scrappy and hungry!

[HAMILTON]
I am not throwing away my shot!

[WASHINGTON]
Son

[WASHINGON AND COMPANY]
We are outgunned, outmanned!

[HAMILTON]
You need all the help you can get
I have some friends. Laurens, Mulligan
Marquis de Lafayette, okay, what else?

[WASHINGTON AND COMPANY]
Outnumbered, outplanned!

[HAMILTON]
We'll need some spies on the inside
Some King's men who might let some things slide
[HAMILTON]
I'll write to Congress and tell ‘em we need supplies, you rally the guys, master the element of surprise

I'll rise above my station, organize your information, ‘til we rise to the occasion of our new nation. Sir!

[ENSEMBLE]
Here comes the General!

[HAMILTON]
Rise up!

[HAMILTON]

[ENSEMBLE]
Here comes the General!

A Winter's Ball

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[BURR]
How does the bastard, orphan, son of a whore
Go on and on
Grow into more of a phenomenon?
Watch this obnoxious, arrogant, loudmouth bother
Be seated at the right hand of the father
Washington hires Hamilton right on sight
But Hamilton still wants to fight, not write
Now Hamilton's skill with a quill is undeniable
But what do we have in common? We're
Reliable with the

[ALL MEN]
Ladies!

[BURR]
There are so many to deflower!

[ALL MEN]
Ladies!

[BURR]
Looks! Proximity to power

[ALL MEN]
Ladies!

[BURR]
They delighted and distracted him
Martha Washington named her feral tomcat after him!

[HAMILTON]
That's true

[FULL COMPANY]
1780

[BURR]
A winter's ball
And the Schuyler sisters are the envy of all
Yo, if you can marry a sister, you're rich, son

[HAMILTON]
Is it a question of if, Burr, or which one?

Helpless

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[HAMILTON/BURR/LAURENS/ALL WOMEN (EXCEPT ELIZA)]
Hey hey hey hey
[ELIZA]
Ohh, I do I do I do I
Dooo! Hey!
Ohh, I do I do I do I
Dooo! Boy you got me [ALL WOMEN]
Hey hey hey hey
Hey hey hey hey
Hey hey hey hey
Hey hey hey

[ELIZA AND WOMEN]
Helpless!
Look into your eyes, and the sky's the limit I'm helpless!
Down for the count, and I'm drownin' in ‘em

[ELIZA]
I have never been the type to try and grab the spotlight
We were at a revel with some rebels on a hot night
Laughin' at my sister as she's dazzling the room
Then you walked in and my heart went "Boom!"
Tryin' to catch your eye from the side of the ballroom
Everybody's dancin' and the band's top volume

[ELIZA AND WOMEN]
Grind to the rhythm as we wine and dine
[ELIZA]
Grab my sister, and
Whisper, "Yo, this
One's mine."

My sister made her way across the room to you
And I got nervous, thinking "What's she gonna do?"
She grabbed you by the arm, I'm thinkin' "I'm through"
Then you look back at me and suddenly I'm
Helpless!

Oh, look at those eyes

Oh!
Yeah, I'm
Helpless, I know

I'm so into you
I am so into you

I know I'm down for the count
And I'm drownin' in ‘em.

[ALL WOMEN]
Oooh

Oooh

Oooh

Oooh

Helpless!

Look into your eyes
And the sky's the limit
I'm
Helpless!
Down for the count
And I'm drownin' in ‘em

I'm helpless!

Look into your eyes
And the sky's the limit I'm helpless!

Down for the count
And I'm drownin' in ‘em.

[HAMILTON]
Where are you taking me?

[ANGELICA]
I'm about to change your life

[HAMILTON]
Then by all means, lead the way

[ELIZA]
Elizabeth Schuyler. It's a pleasure to meet you

[HAMILTON]
Schuyler?

[ANGELICA]
My sister

[ELIZA]
Thank you for all your service

[HAMILTON]
If it takes fighting a war for us to meet, it will have been worth it

[ANGELICA]
I'll leave you to it

[ELIZA AND WOMEN]
One week later

[ELIZA]
I'm writin' a letter nightly
Now my life gets better, every letter that you write me
Laughin' at my sister, cuz she wants to form a harem

[ANGELICA]
I'm just sayin', if you really loved me, you would share him
[ELIZA]
Ha!
Two weeks later
In the living room stressin'
My father's stone-faced
While you're asking for his blessin'
I'm dying inside, as
You wine
And dine
And I'm tryin' not to cry
‘cause there's nothing that your mind can't do
My father makes his way across the room
To you
I panic for a second, thinking
"we're through"
But then he shakes your hand and says
"Be true"
And you turn back to me, smiling, and I'm
Helpless!

Helpless!
Hoo!

That boy is mine
That boy is mine!

Helpless! Helpless!
Down for the count
And I'm drownin' in em

[ALL WOMEN]
Stressin'

Blessin'

Oooh

Oooh

Oooh

Oooh

Helpless!
Look into your eyes
And the sky's the
Limit I'm
Helpless!
Down for the count
And I'm drownin' in
‘em I'm
Helpless!

Look into your eyes
And the sky's the
Limit I'm
Helpless!
Down for the count
And I'm drownin' in em

[HAMILTON]
Eliza, I don't have a dollar to my name
An acre of land, a troop to command, a dollop of fame
All I have's my honor, a tolerance for pain
A couple of college credits and my top-notch brain
Insane, your family brings out a different side of me
Peggy confides in me, Angelica tried to take a bite of me
No stress, my love for you is never in doubt
We'll get a little place in Harlem and we'll figure it out
I've been livin' without a family since I was a child
My father left, my mother died, I grew up buckwild
But I'll never forget my mother's face, that was real
And long as I'm alive, Eliza, swear to God
You'll never feel so...

[HAMILTON]
Eliza...

I've never felt so-

My life is gon' be fine cuz Eliza's in it.
[ELIZA]
I do I do I do I do!

I do I do I do I do!

Hey, yeah, yeah!

I'm down for the count
I'm-

I look into your eyes, and the sky's the limit
I'm

...drownin' in ‘em. [ALL WOMEN]
Helpless!

Helpless!

Helpless!

Down for the count
And I'm drownin' in ‘em

Helpless!

Helpless!

Helpless!

Down for the count
And I'm drownin' in ‘em.

Satisfied

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[LAURE]

Alright, alright. That's what I'm talkin' about!
Now everyone give it up for the maid of honor
Angelica Schuyler!
[ANGELICA]
A toast to the groom!

To the bride!

From your sister

Who is always by your side

To your union

And the hope that you provide

May you always...

Be satisfied.

[ALL MEN]
To the groom!
To the groom!
To the groom!

To the bride!
To the bride!

Angelica!
Angelica!
Angelica!

By your side!

To the union!
To the revolution!

You provide!
You provide!

[HAMILTON AND MEN]
Always-

Rewind-

[ALL WOMEN]
To the groom!

To the bride!

To the bride!

[ELIZA AND WOMEN]
Angelica!

By your side!

To the union!
To the revolution!

You provide!

Always-

Rewind-

[ANGELICA]
I remember that night, I just might
Regret that night for the rest of my days

I remember those soldier boys
Tripping over themselves to win our praise

I remember that dreamlike candlelight
Like a dream that you can't quite place

But Alexander, I'll never forget the first
Time I saw your face

I have never been the same
Intelligent eyes in a hunger-pang frame
And when you said "Hi," I forgot my dang name
Set my heart aflame, ev'ry part aflame

[FULL COMPANY]
This is not a game...

[HAMILTON]
You strike me as a woman who has never been satisfied

[ANGELICA]
I'm sure I don't know what you mean. You forget yourself

[HAMILTON]
You're like me. I'm never satisfied

[ANGELICA]
Is that right?

[HAMILTON]
I have never been satisfied

[ANGELICA]
My name is Angelica Schuyler

[HAMILTON]
Alexander Hamilton

[ANGELICA]
Where's your fam'ly from?

[HAMILTON]
Unimportant. There's a million things I haven't done but
Just you wait, just you wait...

[ANGELICA]
So so so-
So this is what it feels like to match wits
With someone at your level! What the hell is the catch? It's
The feeling of freedom, of seein' the light
It's Ben Franklin with a key and a kite! You see it, right?
The conversation lasted two minutes, maybe three minutes
Ev'rything we said in total agreement, it's
A dream and it's a bit of a dance
A bit of a posture, it's a bit of a stance. He's a
Bit of a flirt, but I'm ‘a give it a chance
I asked about his fam'ly, did you see his answer?
His hands started fidgeting, he looked askance?
He's penniless, he's flying by the seat of his pants

Handsome, boy, does he know it!
Peach fuzz, and he can't even grow it!
I wanna take him far away from this place
Then I turn and see my sister's face and she is...

[ELIZA]
Helpless...

[ANGELICA]
And I know she is...

[ELIZA]
Helpless...

[ANGELICA]
And her eyes are just...

[ELIZA]
Helpless...

[ANGELICA]
And I realize

[ANGELICA AND COMPANY]
Three fundamental truths at the exact same time...

[HAMILTON]
Where are you taking me?

[ANGELICA]
I'm about to change your life

[HAMILTON]
Then by all means, lead the way

[COMPANY (EXCEPT ANGELICA)]
Number one!

[ANGELICA]
I'm a girl in a world in which
My only job is to marry rich
My father has no sons so I'm the one
Who has to social climb for one
So I'm the oldest and the wittiest and the gossip in
New York City is insidious
Alexander is penniless
Ha! That doesn't mean I want him any less

[ELIZA]
Elizabeth Schuyler. It's a pleasure to meet you

[HAMILTON]
Schuyler?

[ANGELICA]
My sister

[COMPANY]
Number two!

[ANGELICA]
He's after me cuz I'm a Schuyler sister
That elevates his status, I'd
Have to be naïve to set that aside
Maybe that is why I introduce him to Eliza
Now that's his bride
Nice going, Angelica, he was right
You will never be satisfied

[ELIZA]
Thank you for all your service

[HAMILTON]
If it takes fighting a war for us to meet, it will have been worth it

[ANGELICA]
I'll leave you to it

[COMPANY]
Number three!

[ANGELICA]
I know my sister like I know my own mind
You will never find anyone as trusting or as kind
If I tell her that I love him she'd be silently resigned
He'd be mine
She would say, "I'm fine"

[ANGELICA AND COMPANY]
She'd be lying

[ANGELICA]
But when I fantasize at night
It's Alexander's eyes
As I romanticize what might
Have been if I hadn't sized him
Up so quickly
At least my dear Eliza's his wife;
At least I keep his eyes in my life...
[ANGELICA]
To the groom!

To the bride!

From your sister

Who is always by your side

To your union

And the hope that you provide

May you always

Be satisfied

And I know

She'll be happy as

His bride
And I know [ALL MEN (EXCEPT HAMILTON)]
To the groom!
To the groom!
To the groom!

To the bride!
To the bride!

Angelica!
Angelica!

By your side

To the union!
To the revolution!

You provide!
You provide!

[HAMILTON AND MEN]
Always-

Be satisfied

Be satisfied

[MEN]
Be satisfied
Be satisfied
Be satisfied
Be satisfied

Be satisfied
Be satisfied

Be satisfied
Be satisfied
Be satisfied
Be satisfied.

[ALL WOMEN (EXCEPT ELIZA)]
To the groom!

To the bride!

To the bride!

[ELIZA AND WOMEN]
Angelica!

By your side

The Story of Tonight (Reprise)

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[LAURE]

I may not live to see our glory!

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE]
I may not live to see our glory!

[LAURE]

But I've seen wonders great and small

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE]
I've seen wonders great and small

[LAURE]

‘Cause if the tomcat can get married

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE]
If Alexander can get married-

[LAURE]

There's hope for our ass, after all!

[LAFAYETTE]
Raise a glass to freedom

[LAURENS/MULLIGAN]
Hey!
Something you will never see again!

[MULLIGAN]
No matter what she tells you

[LAFAYETTE]
Let's have another round tonight!

[LAURE]

Raise a glass to the four of us!

[LAFAYETTE/HAMILTON]
Ho!

[MULLIGAN]
To the newly not poor of us!

[LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/HAMILTON]
Woo!

[LAFAYETTE]
We'll tell the story of tonight

[LAURE]

Let's have another round-

[HAMILTON]
Well, if it isn't Aaron Burr

[BURR]
Sir!

[HAMILTON]
I didn't think that you would make it

[BURR]
To be sure

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE]
Burr!

[BURR]
I came to say congratulations

[MULLIGAN]
Spit a verse, Burr!

[BURR]
I see the whole gang is here

[LAFAYETTE]
You are the worst, Burr!

[HAMILTON]
Ignore them. Congrats to you, Lieutenant Colonel
I wish I had your command instead of manning George's journal

[BURR]
No, you don't

[HAMILTON]
Yes, I do

[BURR]
Now, be sensible
From what I hear, you've made yourself indispensable

[LAURE]

Well, well, I heard
You've got a special someone on the side, Burr

[HAMILTON]
Is that so?

[LAURE]

What are you tryin' to hide, Burr?

[BURR]
I should go

[HAMILTON]
No, these guys should go

[LAFAYETTE]
What?

[LAURE]

No!

[HAMILTON]
Leave us alone

[MULLIGAN]
Man...

[HAMILTON]
It's alright, Burr. I wish you'd brought this girl with you tonight, Burr

[BURR]
You're very kind, but I'm afraid it's unlawful, sir

[HAMILTON]
What do you mean?

[BURR]
She's married

[HAMILTON]
I see

[BURR]
She's married to a British officer

[HAMILTON]
Oh shit...

[BURR]
Congrats again, Alexander. Smile more
I'll see you on the other side of the war

[HAMILTON]
I will never understand you
If you love this woman, go get her! What are you waiting for?

[BURR]
I'll see you on the other side of the war

[HAMILTON]
I'll see you on the other side of the war

Wait For It

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[BURR]
Theodosia writes me a letter everyday
I'm keeping the bed warm while her husband is away
He's on the British side in Georgia
He's trying to keep the colonies in line
But he can keep all of Georgia
Theodosia, she's mine

Love doesn't discriminate
Between the sinners
And the saints
It takes and it takes and it takes
And we keep loving anyway
We laugh and we cry
And we break
And we make our mistakes
And if there's a reason I'm by her side
When so many have tried
Then I'm willing to wait for it
I'm willing to wait for it
[BURR]
My grandfather was a fire and brimstone preacher

But there are things that the
Homilies and hymns won't teach ya

My mother was a genius

My father commanded respect

When they died they left no instructions
Just a legacy to protect

[LAURE]

GOOD NEWS, SHE'S DEAD!
THE WITCH OF THE WEST IS DEAD!
THE WICKEDEST WITCH THERE EVER WAS,
THE ENEMY OF ALL OF US HERE IN [,
IS DEAD! GOOD NEWS! GOOD NEWS!

[LAURE]

Look, it's Glinda!


[LAURE]

floats in on a giant bubble

[LAURE]

 It's good to see me, isn't it? ([Ozians Agree) No need to respond that was rhetorical. Fellow [Ozia]


[BURR]
LET US BE GLAD,
LET US BE GRATEFUL,
LET US REJOICIFY THAT GOODNESS COULD SUBDUE
THE WICKED WORKINGS OF YOU KNOW WHO!
ISN'T IT NICE TO KNOW
THAT GOOD WILL CONQUER EVIL?
THE TRUTH WE ALL BELIEVE'LL BY AND BY
OUTLIVE A LIE
FOR YOU AND...

[BURR]
Glinda! Exactly how dead is she?

[[Burr] Well, there has been much rumor and speculation... innuendo, outuendo...
but let me set the record straight. According to the Time Dragon Clock, the melting occurred at the 13th hour;
a direct result of a bucket of water thrown by a female child. Yes, the Wicked Witch of the West is dead!

[Ozian]
NO ONE MOURNS THE WICKED!

[Ozian]
NO ONE CRIES THEY WON'T RETURN!

[Ozia]

NO ONE LAYS A LILY ON THEIR GRAVE!
[Ozian Man]
THE GOOD MAN SCORNS THE WICKED!
Women]
THROUGH THEIR LIVES OUR CHILDREN LEARN!

[Ozia]

WHAT WE MISS WHEN WE MISBEHAVE!
[Burr]
AND GOODNESS KNOWS
THE WICKEDS' LIVES ARE LONELY
GOODNESS KNOWS
THE WICKED DIE ALONE
IT JUST SHOWS WHEN YOU'RE WICKED
YOU'RE LEFT ONLY
ON YOUR OWN
[Ozia]

YES, GOODNESS KNOWS
THE WICKEDS' LIVES ARE LONELY
GOODNESS KNOWS
THE WICKED CRY ALONE
NOTHING GROWS FOR THE WICKED
THEY REAP ONLY
WHAT THEY'VE SEWN
[Ozian] Glinda, why does wickedness happen?
[Burr] That's a good question; one that many people find confusifying. Are people born wicked,
or do they have wickedness thrust upon them? After all, she had a childhood,;
She had a father, who just happed to be the governor of munchlinkland Witch's Parents Enter.

[Frex]
 I'm off to the assembly, dear.
[Burr] She had a mother, as so many do...
[Frex]

HOW I HATE TO GO AND LEAVE YOU LONELY
Melena]
THAT'S ALRIGH IT'S ONLY JUST ONE NIGHT
[Frex]

BUT KNOW THAT YOU'RE HERE, IN MY HEART
WHILE I'M OUT OF YOUR SIGHT!
Frex Exits. A Lover Runs Into The Room.
[Burr] And like all families, they had their secrets.
Lover]
HAVE ANOTHER DRINK, MY DARK EYED BEAUTY,
I'VE GOT ONE MORE NIGHT LEFT HERE IN TOWN,
SO HAVE ANOTHER DRINK OF GREEN ELIXER
AND WE'LL HAVE OURSELVES A LITTLE MIXER
HAVE ANOTHER LITTLE SWALLOW LITTLE LADY,
AND FOLLOW ME DOWN
[Burr] And of course, from the moment she was born she was... well... different!
Midwife] AHHH!! It's coming!
[Frex]
 Now?
Midwife] The baby's coming!
[Frex]
 And how!

Midwife]
I SEE A NOSE!
[Frex]

I SEE A CURL!
Both]
IT'S A HEALTHY, PERFECT, LOVELY LITTLE...
(They Scream)
Melena] What is it? What's wrong?
Midwife]
HOW CAN IT BE?
[Frex]

WHAT DOES IT MEAN?
Midwife]
IT'S ATTROCIOUS!
[Frex]

IT'S OBSCENE!
Both]
LIKE A FROGGY, FERNY CABBAGE,
THE BABY IS UNATURALLY
GREEN!!!
[Frex]
 Take it away... Take it away!!!!
[Burr] So you see, it couldn't have been easy!

Munchki]

NO ONE MOURNS THE WICKED!
NOW AT LAST, SHE'S DEAD AND GONE!
NOW AT LAST THERE'S JOY THROUGHOUT THE LAND!
AND GOODNESS KNOWS (GOODNESS KNOWS)
WE KNOW WHAT GOODNESS IS (OOOOHHHH)
GOODNESS KNOWS, THE WICKED DIE ALONE (SHE DIED ALONE)
WOE TO THOSE (WOE TO THOSE)
WHO SPURN WHAT GOODNESSES THEY ARE SHOWN!
NO ONE MOURNS THE WICKED (GOOD NEWS)
NO ONE MOURNS THE WICKED (GOOD NEWS)
NO ONE MOURNS... THE WICKED...
WICKED...
WICKED!!!!!
[Burr] Well, this has been fun! But as you can imagine I have much to attend to,
what with the Wizard's unexpected departure. So, if there are no further questions...
[Ozian] Glinda, is it true you were her friend?
[Ozians Gasp
[Burr] Well, I... you see... um... yes.
Louder Gasps
[Burr] Well, it depends on what you mean by "friend". She Motions Her Bubble Downward.
I did know her. That is, our paths did cross... at school. But you must understand, it was a long time ago and we were both very young.

[Students]

O, HALLOWED HALLS AND VINE DRAPED WALLS
THE PROUDLIEST SITE THERE IS.
WHEN GREY AND SEER OUR HAIR HATH TURNED,
WE SHALL STILL REVERE THE LESSONS LEARNED
IN OUR DAYS AT DEAR OLD SHIZ (DEAR OLD SHIZ)
OUR DAYS AT DEAR OLD...

SHIZZZZZZZZZZZ (DEAR OLD SHIZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ)
Frex Wheels Nessarose On Stage.
[HAMILTON]
 What?! What are you looking at? Oh, do I have something in my teeth?
Okay, let's get this over with. No, I'm not seasick, yes, I've always been green, no, I didn't chew grass as a child.
[Frex]
 Elphaba!
[HAMILTON] Oh, this is my younger sister, Nessarose. As you can see, she is a perfectly normal color.
[Frex]
 Elphaba, stop making a spectacle of yourself! I'm only sending you here for one reason...
[HAMILTON] Yes, I know, to look after Nessarose.
Frex Holds Out A Box.
[Frex]
 My precious little girl] a parting gift.
[Angelica]
 Now, father... He Pulls Silver Shoes From The Box. Jeweled shoes!
[Frex]
 As befits the future governor of Munchkinland. Elphaba, take care of your sister.
And try not to talk so much! He Kisses Nessarose And Exits.
[Angelica]
 Elphaba...
[HAMILTON] Well what could he have gotten me? I clash with everything!
Mme. Morrible Enters
[Morrible]
 Welcome, new students! I am Madame Morrible, headmistress here, at Shiz University.
And whether you're here to study logic, literature, or linguification,
I know I speak for my fellow faculty members when I say we have nothing but the highest hopes for some of you.
Now, regarding room assignments... Elphaba & Galinda Raise Their Hands.
She Notices Galinda First. Yes, is this regarding room assignments?
[linda]

 Oh, Madame, thank you for asking, but I've already been assigned a private suite...
Noticing Her Followers' Disappointment. But you can all come visit me whenever you want!
Shen Shen] How good of you!
Pfanee] You are so good!
[linda]

 No I'm not!
Both] Yes you are!
[linda]

 Now stop! Swishes Her Hair.
[Morrible]
 Do you have a question?

[linda]

 Yes, you see, I am Galinda Upland of the Upperuplands... I've applied to your sorcery seminar,
and indeed that is my sole purpose of attending Shiz; to study sorcery with you.
Perhaps you recall my essay, "Magic Wands, Need They Have A Point".
[Morrible]
 Yes... However, I do not teach my seminar every semester, unless, of course, somebody special were to come along.
[linda]

 Well, exactly!
[HAMILTON] We have not yet received our room assignments.
[Morrible]
 Yes, yes, of course! Oh, You must be Miss Nessarose, the governor's daughter.
What a tragically beautiful face you have! Sees Elphaba, snorts...And you must be.
[HAMILTON] I'm the other daughter. Elphaba. I'm beautifully tragic.
[Morrible]
 Yes, yes, I'm sure you're very bright.
[linda]

 Bright? She's phosphorescent.
[Morrible]
 I don't seem to have you on my list. Oh, well a slight gulch, but not to fret! We'll find someplace to put you.
[linda]

 Y'know, I don't even think she read my essay.
Shen Shen] That's so unfair!
[Angelica]
 You should say something!
[linda]

 Should I?
Pfanee] Do it!
[Morrible]
 Now, which one of you young ladies would like to volunteer to share with Miss Elphaba?
[linda]

 Madame Morrible...
[Morrible]
 Thank you dear. Oh, how very good of you!
[linda]

 What?
[Morrible]
 Miss Elphaba, you may share with Miss Galinda.
[linda]

 Huh?
[Morrible]
 The governor made his concern for your sister's well being quite clear.
So, I thought it would be best if she share my private compartment where I can assist her as needed...
[HAMILTON] But Madame, I've always looked after my sister.
[Morrible]
 Everyone, to your dormitories.
[HAMILTON] But Madame...
[HAMILTON] Let her go!!!
Nessarose's Wheelchair Is Torn From Morrible's Hands And Begins To Wheel Itself Back To Elphaba.
[Morrible]
 How did you do that?
[linda]

 How did she do that?
[Angelica]
 Elphaba!
[Morrible]
 You mean this has happened before?
[HAMILTON] Uh... Something just comes over me sometimes... I'm sorry, Madame.
[Morrible]
 What? Never apologize for talent! Talent is a gift! Have you ever considered a career in sorcery?
[HAMILTON] Sorcery?
[Morrible]
 I shall tutor you myself, and take no other students.
[linda]

 What?
All Students But Galinda Exit.
[Morrible]
 Oh, Miss Elphaba...
MANY YEARS I HAVE WAITED
FOR A GIFT LIKE YOURS TO APPEAR
WHY I PREDICT THE WIZARD COULD MAKE YOU HIS
MAGIC, GRAND VIZIER!
MY DEAR, MY DEAR,
I'LL WRITE AT ONCE TO THE WIZARD
TELL HIM OF YOU IN ADVANCE
WITH A TALENT LIKE YOURS, DEAR, THERE IS
A DEFIN-ISH CHANCE
IF YOU WORK AS YOU SHOULD
YOU'LL BE MAKING GOOD
[linda]

 Madame Morrible...
[Morrible]
 No, not now dearest. She Exits.
[Burr] This will just make me a better person. She simles.
She Runs Off.

[HAMILTON]
DID THAT REALLY JUST HAPPEN?
HAVE I ACTUALLY UNDERSTOOD?
THIS WEIRD QUIRK I'VE TRIED TO SURPRESS OR HIDE
IS A TALENT THAT COULD HELP ME MEET THE WIZARD
IF I MAKE GOOD
SO I'LL MAKE GOOD.
WHEN I MEET THE WIZARD,
ONCE I PROVE MY WORTH,
AND THEN I MEET THE WIZARD,
WHAT I'VE WAITED FOR SINCE
SINCE BIRTH!
AND WITH ALL HIS WIZARD WISDOM
BY MY LOOKS HE WON'T BE BLINDED
DO YOU THINK THE WIZARD IS DUMB?
OR LIKE MUNCHKINS SO SMALL-MINDED? NO!
HE'LL SAY TO ME "I SEE WHO YOU TRULY ARE,
A GIRL ON WHOM I CAN RELY"
AND THAT'S HOW WE'LL BEGIN,
THE WIZARD AND I
ONCE I'M WITH THE WIZARD,
MY WHOLE LIFE WILL CHANGE,
'CUZ ONCE YOU'RE WITH THE WIZARD
NO ONE THINKS YOU'RE STRANGE
NO FATHER IS NOT PROUD OF YOU,
NO SISTER ACTS ASHAMED,
AND ALL OF OzHAS TO LOVE YOU
WHEN BY THE WIZARD YOU'RE ACLAIMED
AND THIS GIFT OR THIS CURSE
THAT I HAVE INSIDE
MAYBE AT LAST I'LL KNOW WHY
WHEN WE ARE HAND IN HAND,
THE WIZARD AND I
AND ONE DAY HE'LL SAY TO ME, "ELPHABA,
A GIRL WHO IS SO SUPERIOR,
SHOULDN'T A GIRL WHO'S SO GOOD INSIDE
HAVE A MATCHING EXTERIOR?
AND SINCE FOLKS HERE TO AN OBSURED DEGREE
SEEM FIXATED ON YOUR VERDEGRIS
WOULD IT BE ALRIGHT BY YOU
IF I DEGREENIFY YOU?"
AND OF COURSE THAT'S NOT IMPORTANT TO ME
"ALRIGHT! WHY NOT?" I'LL REPLY
OH, WHAT A PAIR WE'LL BE
THE WIZARD AND I
YES, WHAT A PAIR WE'LL BE
THE WIZARD AND...
UNLIMITED, MY FUTURE IS UNLIMITED
AND I'VE JUST HAD A VISION ALMOST LIKE A PROPHECY
I KNOW
IT SOUNDS TRULY CRAZY
AND TRUE, THE VISION'S HAZY
BUT I SWEAR SOME DAY THERE'LL BE
A CELEBRATION THROUGHOUT [Oz
THAT'S ALL TO DO
WITH ME!
AND I'LL STAND THERE WITH THE WIZARD
FEELING THINGS I'VE NEVER FELT
AND THOUGH I'D NEVER SHOW IT
I'D BE SO HAPPY I COULD MELT!
AND SO IT WILL BE FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE
AND I'LL WANT NOTHING ELSE 'TILL I DIE
HELD IN SUCH HIGH ESTEEM!
WHEN PEOPLE SEE ME THEY WILL SCREAM
FOR HALF OF [Oz'S FAVORITE TEAM]
THE WIZARD...
AND I!!!!

[linda]

 Dearest, Darlingest Momsy and Popsicle...
[HAMILTON] My dear father...
Both]
THERE'S BEEN SOME CONFUSION OVER ROOMING HERE AT SHIZ
[HAMILTON]
BUT, OF COURSE, I'LL CARE FOR NESSA...

BUT, OF COURSE, I'LL RISE ABOVE IT...
Both]
FOR I KNOW THAT'S HOW YOU'D WANT ME TO RESPOND
Yes...
THERE'S BEEN SOME CONFUSION FOR YOU SEE MY ROOMATE IS...
[linda]


UNUSUALLY, AND EXCEEDLINGLY PECULIAR AND ALTOGETHER QUITE IMPOSSIBLE TO DESCRIBE...
[HAMILTON] Blonde.
[linda]

I FELT THE MOMENT I LAID EYES ON YOU!
[linda]


MY PULSE IS RUSHING...
[HAMILTON]
MY HEAD IS REELING...

WITH SIMPLE, UTTER LOATHING
THERE'S A STRANGE EXHILARTION

STILL I DO BELIEVE THAT IT CAN LAST!
AND I WILL BE LOATHING, LOATHING YOU

[Students]

DEAR GALINDA, YOU ARE JUST TOO GOOD!
HOW DO YOU STAND IT, I DON'T THINK I COULD!
SHE'S A TERROR! SHE'S A TARTAR!
WE DON'T MEAN TO SHOW A BIAS,
BUT GALINDA, YOU'RE A MARTAR!
[linda]

 Well...

[Students]

[HAMILTON] Boo!
[linda]

 Ahh!
[HAMILTON] Hahahaha!

[Hamilton]
 Settle down, now! I have read your most recent essays. And I am amazed to report the progress!
Although, some of us still tend to favor form over content... Ms. Glinda.
[linda]

 It's GAlinda.
[Hamilton]
 Excuse me... Glinda.
[linda]

 I really don't see what the problem is. Every other professor seems to be able to pronounce my name.
[HAMILTON] Maybe pronouncing your precious name isn't the sole purpose of Doctor Dillamond's life. Maybe he's not like every other professor. Maybe some of us are different.
[linda]

 Oh! It seems the artichoke is steamed.
[Hamilton]
 Class, class! Miss Elphaba has a point! As you know, I am the sole Animal on the faculty. The token Goat, as it were. But it wasn't always this way. Oh, dear students, how I wish you could have seen it as it once was. Where you could walk down the halls and see an antelope explicating a sonnet, a snow leopard solving an equation, a wildebeast waxing philosophic. Don't you see, dear students, how our dear Ozis becoming less and less...looks at Elphaba... colorful. Now, who can tell me what sent these events into motion?
[HAMILTON] Raises hand From what I've heard, it all started with the great drought.
[Hamilton]
 Exactly. Food grew scarce, people grew hungrier and angrier. And the question became "Whom can we blame?" Can anyone tell me what is meant by the term "Scapegoat"? Elphaba Raises Hand. Someone besides Miss Elphaba? Ah yes, Miss Glinda...
[linda]

 It's GAlinda... with a GA. I don't see why you can't just teach us history instead of always harping on the past.
[Hamilton]
 Well, perhaps these questions will enlighten you... Walks Over To The Chalk Board And Turns It Over. On it is written] ANIMALS SHOULD BE SEEN AND NOT HEARD. Who is responsible for this? I'm waiting for answer... Very well, that will be all for today... You heard me, class dismissed!!!
All Students Exit Except Elphaba & Nessarose. Dillamond Has His Back Turned To Her.
[HAMILTON] You go on ahead, Nessa.
Nessarose Exits.
[HAMILTON] Reading The Board Aloud. "Animals should be seen and not heard..."
[Hamilton]
 Oh, Miss Elphaba, don't worry about me, go along and enjoy your friends.
[HAMILTON] Oh that's alright, I have no friends. Would you like to share my lunch?
[Hamilton]
 Oh, thank you! How kind.
She Pulls Out A Candy Bar And Unwraps It. He Takes The Paper and Begins To Eat It. He Sees The Board.
[Hamilton]
 I seem to have lost my appetite.
[HAMILTON] You shouldn't let statements like that bother you. I mean, I always do, but you shouldn't.
[Hamilton]
if it were only a matter of words on a chalkboard. But the things one hears these days... dreadful things! Miss Elphaba...

I'VE HEARD OF AN OX, A PROFESSOR FROM QUOX
NO LONG PERMITTED TO TEACH,
WHO HAS LOST ALL POWERS OF SPEECH.
AND AN OWL IN MUNCHKIN ROCK
A VICAR WITH A THRIVING FLOCK
FORBIDDEN TO PREACH
NOW HE ONLY CAN SCREECH!
ONLY RUMORS, BUT STILL, ENOUGH TO GIVE PAUSE
TO ANYONE WITH PAWS
SOMETHING BAD IS HAPPENING IN [Oz
[HAMILTON]
SOMETHING BAD?
HAPPENING IN [Oz?
[Hamilton]

UNDER THE SURFACE
BEHIND THE SCENES
SOMETHING BAAAAAH...
Sorry, bad...
[HAMILTON] Dr. Dillamond, are you alright? Shall I fetch you a glass of water?
[Hamilton]
 No, I don't know what came over me.
[HAMILTON] So, you're saying that there are animals that have, somehow, forgotten how to speak? But, how is that possible?
[Hamilton]
 Well, with so much pressure not to...
Morrible Enters.
[Morrible]
 I heard there was some sort of disturburance in class. Are you alright, Doctor? Oh, Miss Elphaba, you're still here! I thought you would have been on your way to my seminar by now.
[HAMILTON] Yes Madame, ordinarily I would be but...
[Morrible]
 But what? I do hope I have not misplaced my trust in you. Magic is a very demanderating mistress, and if one has ambitions of meeting the Wizard. I'm sure Doctor Dillamond sees my point.
Morrible Exits.
[HAMILTON] I'd better go. Doctor Dillamond, if something bad is happening to the Animals then someone has to tell the Wizard. That's why we have a Wizard!
SO NOTHING BAD
Both]
NOTHNG ALL THAT BAD
[Hamilton]

NOTHING TRULY BAAAAHHH...
Sorry... Bad.
[HAMILTON]
IT COULDN'T HAPPEN HERE,
IN [Oz...


[BURR]
 Here we are, sir! Shiz University!
[BURR]
 What? Already?
[BURR]
 Yes, sir.
[BURR]
 What a shame. Well, we'll see you soon, Avaric. Don't worry, I won't last longer at this school than I did at any of the others.
Avaric Exits.
[Angelica]
 Uh, miss Galinda, I know I'm just a munchkin, but munchkins have feelings too, and I've been trying to tell you mine, for you. But sometimes it seems like you don't even know I'm there.
[linda]

 That's not true, Biq.
[Angelica]
 It's LAFAYETE.
[linda]

 Biq, do you know who that is? That's Fiyero Tiggular, tha Winkie Prince whose reputation is so scandalacious!
LAFAYETE Looks Disgusted. Fiyero Walks Toward Them. Galinda Swishes Her Hair. Fiyero, Noticing Her Strange Behavior, Does The Same.
[linda]

 To Fiyero. Were you looking for something or someone?
[BURR]
 Uhhh yea... history... class? I don't know... somewhere?
[Angelica]
 History building is way over there my friend...
[linda]

 That class just ended!
[BURR]
 Oh! Perfect timing! So, uh, what does one do for fun around here?
[linda]

 Nothing really... until now...
[Angelica]
 We've been studying!
[BURR]
 Well, I see that once again the responsibility to corrupt my fellow students falls to me. Fortunately, I'm up for the task.


[BURR]

THE TROUBLE WITH SCHOOLS IS
THEY ALWAYS TRY TO TEACH THE WRONG LESSON
BELIEVE ME, I'VE BEEN KICKED OUT OF ENOUGH OF THEM TO KNOW!
THEY WANT YOU TO BECOME LESS CALLOW, LESS SHALLOW,
BUT I SAY WHY INVITE STRESS IN?
STOP STUDYING STRIFE
AND LEARN TO LIVE
THE UNEXAMINED LIFE...
DANCIN' THROUGH LIFE
SKIMMING THE SURFACE
GLIDING WHERE TURF IS SMOOTH
LIFE IS PAINLESS FOR THE BRAINLESS
THOSE WHO DON'T TRY, NEVER LOOK FOOLISH
DANCING THROUGH LIFE
NO NEED TO TOUGH IT
WHEN YOU CAN SLUFF IT OFF AS I DO
NOTHING MATTERS, BUT KNOWING NOTHING MATTERS
IT'S JUST LIFE, SO KEEP DANCING THROUGH
DANCING THROUGH LIFE
SWAYING AND SWEEPING
AND ALWAYS KEEPING COOL
LIFE IS FRAUGHTLESS
WHEN YOU'RE THOUGHTLESS
THOSE WHO DON'T TRY
NEVER LOOK FOOLISH
DANCING THROUGH LIFE
MINDLESS AND CARELESS
MAKE SURE YOU'RE WHERE LESS TROUBLE IS RIFE
WHOES ARE FLEETING
BLOWS ARE GLANCING
WHEN YOU'RE DANCING
THROUGH LIFE!
So! What's the most swankified place in town?
[linda]

 That would be the

Sounds perfect!
LET'S GO DOWN TO THE [OzDUST BALLROOM
WE'LL MEET THERE LATER TONIGHT
WE CAN DANCE 'TIL IT'S LIGHT
FIND THE PRETTIEST GIRL
GIVE HER A WHIRL!
RIGHT ON DOWN TO THE [OzDUST BALLROOM
COME ON FOLLOW ME!
YOU'LL BE HAPPY TO BE THERE
[Students]

DANCIN' THROUGH LIFE, DOWN AT THE [OzDUST (LIFE!)
[BURR]

IF ONLY BECAUSE DUST IS WHAT WE COME TO!
[Students]

NOTHIN' MATTERS, BUT KNOWING NOTHING MATTERS
IT'S JUST LIFE!!!
[BURR]

SO KEEP DANCING THROUGH...
[Angelica]
 Miss Galinda? I hope you'll save at least one dance for me. I'll be waiting right there, right by your side, waiting, all night.
[linda]

 Oh, how very kind, Biq.
[Angelica]
 ... LAFAYETE...
[linda]

 But, do you know what would be even kinder?
SEE THAT TRAGICALLY BEAUTIFUL GIRL?
THE ONE IN THE CHAIR?
IT SEEMS SO UNFAIR
WE SHOULD GO ON A SPREE
AND NOT SHE, GEE
I KNOW SOMEONE WOULD BE MY HERO
IF THAT SOMEONE WERE
TO GO INVITE HER!
[Angelica]
 Well, maybe I could invite her!
[linda]


OH, BIQ, REALLY?
YOU WOULD DO THAT FOR ME?
[Angelica]
 I would do anything for you, Miss Galinda. Walks Over To Nessarose.
Excuse me, Miss Nessarose? There's something I'd like to ask you...
[BURR]
 To Galinda. You're good.
[linda]

 I don't know what you mean. But I do happen to be free tonight, so...
[BURR]
 So, I'll be picking you up around eight?
[linda]

 After all...
NOW THAT WE'VE MET ONE ANOTHER,
Both]
IT'S CLEAR WE DESERVE EACHOTHER!
[linda]

 You're perfect!
[BURR]
 You're perfect!
[CAST]
SO WE'RE PERFECT TOGETHER
BORN TO BE FOREVER
DANCING THROUGH LIFE!!!
[HAMILTON] It's absurd! This silly, rich boy appears and everyone's off to worship him and some cultish social gathering!
[Angelica]
 Even me! I'm going! Isn't it wonderful? LAFAYETE was too shy to ask me at first, but once Galinda encouraged him...
[HAMILTON] Galinda?!
[Angelica]
 Don't you dare say another word against her! I'm about to have the first happy night of my life all thanks to Galinda!
FINALLY FOR THIS ONE NIGHT,
I'M ABOUT TO HAVE A FUN NIGHT
WITH THIS MUNCHKIN BOY GALINDA FOUND FOR ME
AND I ONLY WISH THERE WERE
SOMETHING I COULD DO FOR HER TO REPAY HER
ELPHABA SEE...
WE DESERVE EACHOTHER AND GALINDA HELPED IT COME TRUE
WE DESERVE EACHOTHER, ME AND LAFAYETE
Please, Elphaba, try to understand.
[HAMILTON] I do...
[linda]

 Now I must accessorize myself for Fiyero.
Shen Shen Pulls The Witch's Hat Out Of One Of Galinda's Hat Boxes.
Pfanee] Galinda, what in [Oz's name!?
[linda]

 Now, just pretend you didn't see that. My granny is always giving me the most hideodeous hats.
I'd give it away, but I don't hate anyone that much.
Shen Shen] Yes you do!
Pfanee] Give it to her! Just do it!
They All Stare At Elphaba. Galinda Walks Forward, Meeting Elphaba Half Way.
[HAMILTON] Galinda, listen, Nessa and I were talking about you just now...
[linda]

 And I was just talking about you! I thought you might want to wear this hat to the party tonight! Gives Her The Hat.
IT'S REALLY... UH... SHARP!
DON'T YOU THINK?
Y'KNOW BLACK, IS THIS YEAR'S PINK!
YOU DESERVE EACHOTHER,
THIS HAT AND YOU,
YOU'RE BOTH SO... SMART!
YOU DESERVE EACHOTHER, SO HERE!
OUT OF THE GOODNESS OF MY HEART!
Galinda Runs Off. Elphaba Laughs At The Sight Of The Hat. She Exits.. The Students Enter And Dance.
When This Is Done, LAFAYETE And Nessarose Appear, Awkwardly Holding Hands.
[Angelica]
 What's in the punch?
[Angelica]
 Lemons, and melons, and pears!
[Angelica]
 Oh my!
[Angelica]

LISTEN NESSA...
[Angelica]
 Yes?
[Angelica]

UH, NESSA...
I'VE GOT SOMETHING TO CONFESS A
REASON WHY, WELL, WHY I ASKED YOU HERE TONIGHT...
NOW, I KNOW IT ISN'T FAIR.
[Angelica]
 Oh, LAFAYETE, I know why.
[Angelica]
 You do?
[Angelica]

IT'S BECAUSE I'M IN THIS CHAIR, AND YOU FELT SORRY FOR ME...
WELL, ISN'T THAT RIGHT?
[Angelica]
 No... it's because... uh... because...
BECAUSE YOU ARE SO BEAUTIFUL!
[Angelica]
 Oh, LAFAYETE!
I THINK YOU'RE WONDERFUL!
AND WE DESERVE EACH OTHER, DON'T YOU SEE THIS IS OUR CHANCE?
WE DESERVE EACH OTHER, DON'T WE LAFAYETE?
[Angelica]
 You know what? Let's dance!
[Angelica]
 What?
[Angelica]

LET'S DANCE!
They Dance, As Well As The Others Around Them. Finally, Mme. Morrible Runs Up To Galinda.
[Morrible]
 Oh, Miss Upland?
[linda]

 Madame Morrible... What are you doing here?
[Morrible]
 I have something for you. She Hands Her A Small Wand.
[linda]

 Gasps. Madame... a training wand... How can I ever express my graditution?
[Morrible]
 Oh, don't thank me! This was your roommate's idea, not mine.
[linda]

 What? Elphaba?
[Morrible]
 Miss Elphaba requested that I include you in sorcery class. She insisted I tell you this very night or she would quit the seminar.
[linda]

 But... why?
[Morrible]
 I have no idea. My personal opinion is you do not have what it takes. I hope you'll prove me wrong... I doubt you will.
She Leaves. Fiyero Comes Up To Galinda.
[BURR]
 What is it?
[linda]

 I got what I wanted...
[BURR]
 Then what's the matter?
[linda]

 Nothing...
[BURR]
 Good. Let's dance...
They Begin To Dance As Elphaba Walks In. They Stop As All The Students Gasp And Make Comments About The Way She Is Dressed. People Then Start Laughing.
[BURR]
 Who in Ozis this?
[linda]

 My roommate... please, don't ... stare!
[BURR]
 How can you help it?
Elphaba Takes Off The Hat, Noticing The Comments. She Waits, Then Puts It Back On And Begins To Dance. She Is Alone. There Is No Music.
[BURR]
 Well I'll say this, she doesn't give a twig about what anyone else thinks.
[linda]

 Of course does, she just pretends not to... I feel awful...
[BURR]
 Why? It's not like it's your fault.
[linda]

 Excuse me... She Walks Over To Elphaba and Clears Her Throat. May I cut in?
Galinda Begins Dancing Just As Horribly. The Students Now Accept It, And Begin To Dance Again As The Music Starts.
All]
DANCING THROUGH LIFE, DOWN AT THE [OzDUST
IF ONLY BECAUSE DUST IS WHAT WE COME TO
AND THE STRANGE THING, YOUR LIFE COULD END UP CHANGING
WHILE YOU'RE DANCING THROUGH

[Scene 9 - Sharing Secrets]
Elphaba & Galinda Barge Into Their Suite... Galinda Is In Hysterics.
[linda]

 Your very first party ever?! Your very first party! Oh I know! Let's tell each other something we've never told anyone... I'll go first] Fiyero and I are going to be married (squeals).
[HAMILTON] Really? He's asked you already?
[linda]

 No, he doesn't know yet... Now, you tell me a secret.
[HAMILTON] Like what?
[linda]

 Like... Why do you always sleep with this funny, little, green bottle under your pillow? Grabs The Bottle.
[HAMILTON] Give that back.
[linda]

 C'mon, tell me. Tell me tell me!
[HAMILTON] It was my mother's! That's all...
Silence.
[linda]

 Hands Her The Bottle. It's not fair. I told you a really good one.
[HAMILTON] My father hates me.
[linda]

 Gasps.
[HAMILTON] No, that's not the secret. It's my fault...
[linda]

 What is?
[HAMILTON] ... that my sister is the way she is. . Pause. You see, when my mother was carrying Nessa, my father was worried that the new baby might come out...
Both] Green.
[HAMILTON] So he made my mother chew milk flowers, day and night. But that made Nessa come too soon, with her little legs all tangled. And my mother never woke up. None of which ever would have happened if not for me.
[linda]

 But that was the milkflowers fault, not yours. That may be your secret, Elphaba, but that doesn't make it true. She Oh look, it's tomorrow! Elphie... do you mind if I call you Elphie?
[HAMILTON] Well, it's a little perky.
[linda]

 And you can call me... Galinda. So... Elphie... now that we're friends, I've decided to make you my new project!
[HAMILTON] You really don't have to do that.
[linda]

 I know, that's what makes me so nice!

[linda]

 Oh Elphie, you mustn't think that way anymore! Your whole life is going to change... and all because of me. Okay, stand... I will turn your frock into a beautiful ball gown! Stand up... She Picks Up Her Wand And Waves It. Ball gown!!! Nothing Happens, So She Repeats. Ball gown!!! Still Nothing Happens. She Taps Her Wand On The Bed. Is this thing on?
[HAMILTON] Do you want me to try?
[linda]

 No, I've got it! She Throws The Wand Down. Oh, just wear the frock... it's pretty! Now,
I'll show you how to flip your hair] Flip flip. Or you could use your hand. Demonstrates.
Or, you can use your whole body. Falls onto bed. Squeals. Now, for the finishing touch.
Takes flower out of her hair, puts it into Elphaba's. Why, Miss Elphaba, look at you, you're beautiful. Hands her the mirror.
[HAMILTON] After Looking In The Mirror. I... I have to go.
She Runs Off.

[HAMILTON] Flips her hair.. Flip Flip! What?
[BURR]
 Nothing, it's just... you've been "Galinda-fied". You don't have to do that , you know?
[Hamilton]
 Alright, take your seats, class! I have something to say, and very little time to say it. This is my last day here at Shiz I am no longer permitted to teach. I want to thank you for your sharing your enthusiasm, your essays, no matter how feebly structured, and even, on occasion, your lunch.
Mme. Morrible Rushes In.
[Morrible]
 Doctor Dillamond! I'm so dreadfully sorry.
[HAMILTON] Madame, we've got to do something.
[Hamilton]
 Miss Elphaba, they can take away my job, but I shall continue speaking out.
Scientist] Come on, goat...
To Men Begin To Carry Him Out Of The Room.
[Hamilton]
 They are not telling you the whole story! Remember that, class! Remember that.
He Is Gone.
[HAMILTON] Doctor Dillamond! After A Pause. Well, are you just going to sit here in silence?
[Morrible]
 Miss Elphaba, there is nothing we can do. Please take your seat.
Professor] Good afternoon, students!
[Morrible]
 Good afternoon.
Professor] Every day, with every tick of the Time Dragon Clock, in every corner of our great [Oz, one hears the silence of progress. For example] this is called a cage!
He Points To A Cage With A Cloth Draped Over It. He Pulls Off The Cloth, Revealing A Lion Cub Inside.
Professor] Now, we will be seeing more and more of them in the near future. This remarkable innovation is actually for the Animal's own good...
[HAMILTON] If this is for his own good, then why is he trembling?
Professor] He's just excited to be here, that's all. Hits the cage. Now, as I was saying, one of the benefits of caging a Lion cub while he's young is that he never, in fact, will learn how to speak.
[HAMILTON] What?
He Motions The Students Forward, Toward The Cage.
Professor] That's right! Come closer!
[HAMILTON] To Fiyero. Can you imagine a world where Animals are kept in cages and they never speak?
Professor] Now, he may seem a bit agitated but that's easily remedied.
[HAMILTON] What should I do?
[BURR]
 I don't know.
[HAMILTON] Well, somebody has to... Do something!!!
Sparks Begin To Fly Everywhere. All Students & The Professor Are Moving Uncontrollably Except Fiyero and Elphaba.
[BURR]
 What's happening?
[HAMILTON] I don't know I got mad...andd
[BURR]
 Alright just don't move! And don't get mad at me... He Grabs The Cage. Well are you coming?
She Runs With Him After He Snatches The Lion Cub.
[HAMILTON] Careful! Don't shake him!
[BURR]
 I'm not!
[HAMILTON] We can't just let him loose anywhere, you know. We have to find someplace safe...
[BURR]
 Don't you think that I realize that? You must think I'm really stupid or something!
[HAMILTON] No, not really stupid.
[BURR]
 Why is it that every time I see you you're causing some sort of commotion?
[HAMILTON] I don't cause commotions, I am one.
[BURR]
 That's for sure.
[HAMILTON] Oh! So you think I should just keep my mouth shut! Is that what you're saying?
[BURR]
 No, I'm...
[HAMILTON] Do you think I want to be this way? Do you think I want to care this much? Don't you know how much easier my life would be if I didn't?
[BURR]
 Do you ever let anyone else talk?
[HAMILTON] Oh, sorry... But can I just say one more thing? You could have just walked away back there.
[BURR]
 So?
[HAMILTON] So, no matter how shallow and self-absorbed you tend to be...
[BURR]
 Excuse me, there's no pretense here. I happen to be genuinely self-absorbed and deeply shallow.
[HAMILTON] No you're not. Or you wouldn't be so unhappy.
[BURR]
 Fine, if you don't want my help...
[HAMILTON] No, I do! Poor little thing, it's heart is trembling... I didn't mean for...
[BURR]
 What did you mean to do? Why was I the only one you didn't do it to?
[HAMILTON] Oh look, you're bleeding... it must have scratched you. Referring To A Cut On His Face.
[BURR]
 Yea... or maybe it scratched me. I better get to safety... I mean the cub... get the cub to safety. He Walks Off.
[HAMILTON] Fiyero...

[[HAMILTON]
Miss Elphaba, there you are!
[HAMILTON] Madame Morrible...
[Morrible]
 Oh Miss Elphaba, I finally heard back from the Wizard!
[HAMILTON] The Wizard?
[Morrible]
 Yes, he wishes to meet you!
[HAMILTON] He asked for me?
[Morrible]
 Yes! I know how devastated you were the other day for our poor Doctor Dillamond, but I can assure you my dear, as one door closes, another one opens. She Hands Her A Green Envelope.
[HAMILTON] Madame, I don't know what to say! How can I ever thank you? She Hugs Her.
[Morrible]
 Oh careful dear, you musn't get wet She Places The Umbrella Back Over Elphaba's Head. Oh, I know! She Waves Her Hands And The Sun Comes Out. Didn't I tell you? Weather is my specialty. [Oz-speed, my dear! Make me proud.
[HAMILTON] I will, I'll try.
Morrible Exits.

[HAMILTON]
AND THERE WE'LL FINALLY BE
THE WIZARD AND I...

Conductor] All aboard!
[linda]

 Remember, eye contact. And don't forget to tell him how wonderful he is, Wizards love that! And be yourself... well... within reason.
LAFAYETE Wheels Nessarose Onstage.
[Angelica]
 Elphaba, I'm so proud of you and I know father would be too. We're all proud, aren't we?
[HAMILTON] You'll be alright, won't you?
[linda]

 She'll be fine! Biq will take care of her, right?
[Angelica]
 ...It's LAFAYETE... I... I can't do this anymore.
He Exits.
[Angelica]
 LAFAYETE...
[linda]

 Nessa, maybe he's just not the right one... for you.
[Angelica]
 No, it's me that's not right. Elphaba, just go, I'll be fine.
She Wheels Herself Offstage.
[HAMILTON] Nessa, wait!
[linda]

 Let her go. She'll have to manage without you. We all will.
[HAMILTON] Please, you'll barely even notice I'm gone. Besides, you have Fiyero. Where is he, anyway? Not that I expected him to say goodbye to me. We barely know each other.
[linda]

 I don't know him either. He's distant, and moodified, and he's been thinking, which really worrries me. I never knew how much he card about that old goat.
Fiyero Enters.
[linda]

 Oh, there he is! Fiyero, over here dearest!
[BURR]
 He Hands Elphaba Flowers. Elphaba, I'm happy for you.
[linda]

 Yes, we are both so happy...
[BURR]
 Uh, listen, I've been thinking...
[HAMILTON] Yes, I've heard.
[BURR]
 About that Lion cub and... everything. I think about that day a lot.
[HAMILTON] Really? So do I.
[linda]

 Me too! Poor Doctor Dillamond. It makes one want to... uh...
take a stand. So I've been thinking of... uh... changing my name.
[BURR]
 Your name?
[linda]

 Well, yes! Since Doctor Dillamond had his own way of pronouncing my name,
in solidarity and to express my outrage, I will henceforward be known no longer as Galinda, but as simply, Glinda.
[BURR]
 Oh well, that's very admirable of you... Glinda. To Elphaba. Elphaba, good luck.
He Runs Off.
[Burr] There, see?
[HAMILTON] Galinda...
[Burr] It's Glinda now. Stupid idea, I don't even know what made me say it.
[HAMILTON] It doesn't matter what your name is, everyone loves you!
[Burr] I don't care! I want him. I don't even think he's perfect anymore and I still want him.
This must be what other people feel like. How do they bear it? They embrace.

[HAMILTON] Come with me.
[Burr] Where?
[HAMILTON] To the Emerald City.
[Burr] Really?
[Ozia]

ONE SHORT DAY, IN THE EMERALD CITY...

[HAMILTON] I want to remember this moment, always. Nobody's pointing, nobody's staring, for the first time, I'm somewhere that I belong.

A Large Head Is Rolled Onstage... It Speaks To The Two... Voice Booming
[Hamilton]
I am [Oz, the great and terrible! Who are you and why do you seek me?
[Burr] Say something!
[HAMILTON] Uh... Elphaba Thropp your terribleness!
His Speaks Normally.
[Hamilton]
Oh? Is that you Elphaba? I didn't realize!
He Climbs Out Of The Head.
[Hamilton]
I hope I didn't startle you, it's so hard to make out peoples' faces all the way back there.
So, let's see... which is which? Elphaba! He grabs her hands. And you must be.
[Burr] Glinda. The Ga is silent.
Elphaba touches the Ozmask.
[Hamilton]
I know. It isn't much, is it? But people expect this sort of thing. You have to give people what they want.
The thing is, I hardly ever let people meet the real me, but this being special occasion.
[HAMILTON] I'm so happy to meet you.
[Hamilton]
Well, that's good. 'Cause that's what I love best] making people happy!
I AM A SENTIMENTAL MAN
WHO ALWAYS LONGED TO BE A FATHER
THAT'S WHY I DO THE BEST I CAN
TO TREAT EACH CITIZEN OF OzAS SON
OR DAUGHTER
SO ELPHABA I'D LIKE TO RAISE YOU HIGH
'CUZ I THINK EVERYONE DESERVES THE CHANCE TO FLY!
AND HELPING YOU WITH YOUR ASCENT
ALLOWS ME TO FEEL SO PARENTAL.
FOR I AM
A SENTIMENTAL MAN!
[HAMILTON] I'm here... we're here to alert you that something bad is happening...
[Hamilton]
Please, I'm the Wizard of [Oz. I already know why you've come.
Elphaba & [Burr] Oooo.
[Hamilton]
Of course, you must prove yourself...
[Burr] Prove yourself, prove yourself.
[HAMILTON] But how?
[Hamilton]
Oh, I don't know.
SOME SORT OF GESTURE
MOSTLY FOR SHOW
SOMETHING TO TEST YOUR ADEPTNESS..
I know! Madame, the book!
Morrible Enters.
[Burr] Madame Morrible...
[Hamilton]
I believe you're well acquainted with my new Press Secretary.
[HAMILTON] Press Secretary?
[Morrible]
 Oh, yes dearies, I've risen up in the world. You'll find that the Wizard is a very generous man.
If you do something for him, he'll do much for you.
[HAMILTON] What do yhou want me to do?
[Hamilton]
Well, this is my monkey servent, Chistery. He looks so longingly at the birds every morning....
[Morrible]
 So the Wizard was thinking, perhaps, a levitation spell...
[Burr] Noticing A Book In Morrible's Hands. Is that the Grimmerie?
[Morrible]
 Yes, the ancient book of spells and enchantments. Hands It To Elphaba.
[Burr] Whispers. Can I touch it?
Morrlbe] Whispers. No!
[HAMILTON] What funny writing...
[Morrible]
 Well it's a lost language. The lost language of spells.
[Hamilton]
It's kind of a recipe book for change.
[Morrible]
 Don't be discouraged if you can't decipherate it, dearie.
I, myself, can only read a spell or two, and that took years and years
[HAMILTON]
AHVEN, TATEY, AVEN TATEY AVEN...
[Hamilton]
She Continues Chanting. Oh, Chistery, what a experience you are about to have!
[HAMILTON] .................................. AH MAY AH TAY ATUM
[Hamilton]
SINCE ONCE I HAVE MY OWN DAY IN THE SKY...
[HAMILTON] AH MAY AH TAH TAY MAY TU SE SAY TA!
[Hamilton]
I KNOW EVERYONE DESERVES THE CHANCE TO FLY!
Chistery Screams & Begins To Twitch.
[HAMILTON] What happened? Is something wrong?
[Morrible]
 No just a transition, dearie.
[HAMILTON] No, stop you're hurting him!
[Hamilton]
She's actually done it!
Chistery Sprouts Wings. And Begins Running Around The Stage.
[HAMILTON] NO! Quick, how do I reverse it?
[Morrible]
 You can't!
[HAMILTON] What?!
[Morrible]
 You can't! Spells are irreversible! I knew she had the power, I told you!
[HAMILTON] You planned all this?
[Morrible]
 Well, you benefit too, dearie! You benefit, too.
[Hamilton]
And this is only the beginning! Look.
The Other Monkeys Begin To Grow Wings And Fly.
[Morrible]
 Won't they make perfect spies?
[HAMILTON] Spies?!
[Hamilton]
You're right, that's a harsh word... how about scouts? That's what they'll be really. They'll fly around [Oz! Report any subversive Animal activity.
[HAMILTON] You can't read this book at all! Can you? That's why you need enemies, and cages, and spies. You have no real power.
[Hamilton]
Exactly... that's why I need you. Don't you see? The world is your oyster, now! You have so many...opportunites. You both do.
[Burr] Thank you, your [Ozness.
Wizard]
SINCE ONCE I HAD MY OWN DAY IN THE SKY
I KNOW EVERYONE DESERVES THE CHANCE TO...
[HAMILTON] NO!
She Runs Off.
[Morrible]
 Elphaba!
[Burr] Elphie! I am so sorry, your Wizardship. I'll fetch her back! Elphie wait!
She Runs After Her.
[Hamilton]
We must get her back. She knows too much.
[Morrible]
 Don't worry! I will handle it.
He Gets Back In The Head. Speaking, Again, With A Powerful Voice.
[Hamilton]
Guards, guards! There is a fugitive loose in the palace! Find her, capture her, and bring her to me!
Guards] Yes your [Ozness!

[Burr] Elphie, wait! Where are you going?
[HAMILTON] Oh no! There are no more stairs! This might be the attic...
[Burr] Elphaba, listen to me...
[HAMILTON] I have to barricade the door! She Picks Up A Broom And Places It Over A Trap Door.
[Burr] Elphaba, why couldn't you have stayed calm for once instead of flying off the handle?
I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY
I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY NOW
I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY HOW YOU'VE HURT YOUR CAUSE FOREVER
I HOPE YOU THINK YOU'RE CLEVER
[HAMILTON]
I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY! I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY TOO
I HOPE YOU'RE PROUD HOW YOU WOULD GROVEL IN SUBMISSION
TO FEED YOUR OWN AMBISSION
Both]
SO THOUGH I CAN'T IMAGINE HOW
I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY
RIGHT NOW...
[Morrible]
 Citizens of [Oz, there is an enemy that must be found and captured! Believe nothing she says. She's evil. Responsible for the mutilation of these poor, innocent monkeys! Her green skin is but an outward manifestation of her twisted nature! This distortion... this repulsion... this... Wicked Witch!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[Burr] Don't be afraid...
[HAMILTON] I'm not... it's the Wizard who should be afraid... of me!
[Burr] Elphie, just say you're sorry before it's too late.
YOU CAN STILL BE WITH THE WIZARD
WHAT YOU'VE WORKED AND WAITED FOR
YOU CAN HAVE ALL YOU EVER WANTED...
[HAMILTON] I know...
BUT I DON'T WANT IT
NO, I CAN'T WANT IT
ANYMORE...
SOMETHING HAS CHANGED WITHIN ME
SOMETHING IS NOT THE SAME
I'M THROUGH WITH PLAYING BY THE RULES
OF SOMEONE ELSE'S GAME!
TOO LATE FOR SECOND GUESSING
TOO LATE TO GO BACK TO SLEEP
IT'S TIME TO TRUST MY INSTINCTS
CLOSE MY EYES...
AND LEAP
IT'S TIME TO TRY DEFYING GRAVITY
I THINK I'LL TRY DEFYING GRAVITY
AND YOU CAN'T PULL ME DOWN
[Burr]
CAN'T I MAKE YOU UNDERSTAND
YOU'RE HAVING DELUSIONS OF GRANDURE?
[HAMILTON]
I'M THROUHG EXCEPTING LIMITS
'CUZ SOMEONE SAYS THEY'RE SO
SOME THINGS I CANNOT CHANGE,
BUT 'TIL I TRY I'LL NEVER KNOW!
TOO LONG I'VE BEEN AFRAID OF
LOSING LOVE I GUESS I'D LOST
WELL IF THAT'S LOVE,
IT COMES AT MUCH TOO HIGH A COST!
I'D SOONER BUY DEFYING GRAVITY
KISS ME GOODBYE I'M DEFYING GRAVITY
AND YOU CAN'T PULL ME DOWN!
The Guards Bang On The Locked Door.
[Guard]
 Open this door, in the name of his supreme [Ozness!
[HAMILTON] Ah May Ah Tay Ah Tum Ditum...
[Burr]
That's what started all this in the first place... that hideous levitation spell! STOP!!!
[Burr] Well... Where are your wings? Maybe you're not as powerful as you think you are...
A Broomstick Floats Across The Room Towards Elphaba.
[HAMILTON] I told you, Glinda... I did it, I tell ya!
The Guards Bang On The Door Once Again.
[HAMILTON] Quick! Get on!
[Burr] What?
[HAMILTON] Come with me... think of what we could do... together.
UNLIMITED, TOGETHER WE'RE UNLIMITED
TOGETHER WE'LL BE THE GREATEST TEAM THERE'S EVER BEEN, GLINDA

[HAMILTON]
THEY'LL NEVER BRING US DOWN.
Well, are you coming?
[Burr] Elphie, you're trembling... here, put this around you...
She Drapes A Black Cape Around Her.
I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY
NOW THAT YOU'RE CHOOSING THIS
[HAMILTON] You too.
I HOPE IT BRINGS YOU BLISS
Both]
I REALLY HOPE YOU GET IT
AND YOU DON'T LIVE TO REGRET IT
I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY IN THE END!
I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY...
MY FRIEND...
Elphaba Runs Off. The Guards Break Down The Door.
[Guard]
 There she is! Don't let her get away!
They Grab Hold Of Glinda.

[HAMILTON]
It's not her. She has nothing to do with. I'm the one you want. It's me. Hahahahaha. It's me! Up here! It's me!
She Rises Up Center Stage Holding Her Broom.
[HAMILTON]
SO IF YOU CARE TO FIND ME,
LOOK TO THE WESTERN SKY
AS SOMEONE TOLD ME LATELY,
EVERYONE DESERVES THE CHANCE TO FLY!
AND IF I'M FLYING SOLO,
AT LEAST I'M FLYING FREE!
TO THOSE WHO GROUND ME,

I'M FLYING HIGH DEFYING GRAVITY!!!

The Act Opens With [Ozians.

[Ozia]

EVERY DAY THE WICKED
EVERY DAY THE TERROR GROWS
ALL OF OzIS EVER ON ALERT
THAT'S THE WAY WITH WICKED-
SPREADING FEAR WHERE E'ER SHE GOES
SEEKING OUT NEW VICTIMS SHE CAN HURT!
[Ozian Woman]
LIKE SOME TERRIBLE GREEN BLIZZARD
THROUGHOUT THE LAND SHE FLIES...
[Ozian Man]
DEFAMING OUR POOR WIZARD
[Ozia]

WITH HER CALUMNIES AND LIES
SHE LIES!
SAVE US FROM THE WICKED
SHIELD US SO WE WON'T BE HEXED
GIVE US WARNING
WHERE WILL SHE STRIKE NEXT
WHERE WILL SHE STRIKE NEXT
WHERE WILL SHE STRIKE NEXT
Glinda, Fiyero and Morrible Appear Onstage On APodium.
[Burr] Fellow [Ozians, as terrifying as terror is, let us put aside our panic for this one day... and celebrate!
OH WHAT A CELEBRATION WE'LL HAVE TODAY!
[Ozia]

THANK GOODNESS!
[Burr]
LET'S HAVE A CELEBRATION THE GLINDA WAY!
[Ozia]

THANK GOODNESS!
[Morrible]

FINALLY A DAY THAT'S TOTALLY WICKED WITCH FREE
All]
WE COULDN'T BE HAPPIER
THANK GOODNESS!
[Morrible]
 And thank goodness for you, Glinda, and your handsome swain, our new captain of the guard.
To Fiyero. Now you've been at the forefront of the hunt for the Wicked Witch, haven't you?
[BURR]
 Not really, but I don't like to think of her as a Wicked Witch.
[Morrible]
 Captain, how does it feel?
[BURR]
 Frustrating... but I became captain of the guard to find her, and I will keep searching!
[Morrible]
 No, being engaged!
[Ozia]
 Congratulotions!
[BURR]
 To Glinda - Confused. This is an engagement party?
[Burr] Surprised?
[BURR]
 Yes!
[Burr] Good, we hoped you'd be... the Wizard and I!
WE COULDN'T BE HAPPIER
RIGHT DEAR?
COULDN'T BE HAPPIER
RIGHT HERE
LOOK WHAT WE'VE GOT
A FAIRY TALE PLOT
OUR VERY OWN HAPPY ENDING
WHERE WE COULDN'T BE HAPPIER
TRUE DEAR?
COULDN'T BE HAPPIER
AND WE'RE HAPPY TO SHARE OUR ENDING VICARIOUSLY
WITH ALL OF YOU!
HE COULDN'T LOOK HANDSOMER
I COULDN'T BE HUMBLER
BECAUSE HAPPY IS WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN ALL YOUR DREAMS COME TRUE...
[Morrible]
 And Glinda, dear, we're happy for you! As Press Secretary,
I have striven to ensure that all of Ozknows the story of your braverism! How I vividly remember...
THE DAY YOU WERE FIRST SUMMONED
TO AN AUDIENCE WITH [Oz,
AND ALTHOUGH HE WOULD NOT TELL YOU WHY INITIALLY
WHEN YOU BOWED BEFORE HIS THROWN
HE DECREED YOU'D HENCE BE KNOWN
AS GLINDA THE GOOD
OFFICIALLY!
[BURR]
 That's not how you described it to me.
[Burr] Oh no, not exactly, but Whispers we'll talk about it later.
[Morrible]

THEN WITH A JEALOUS SQUEEE
THE WICKED WITCH BURST FROM CONCEALMENT
WHERE SHE HAD BEEN LURKING
SURREPTITIALLY!
Gasps From Among The Crowd.
[Ozian]
I HEAR SHE HAS AN EXTRA EYE THAT ALWAYS REMAINS AWAKE!
[Ozian]
I HEAR THAT SHE CAN SHED HER SKIN AS EASILY AS A SNAKE!
[Ozian]
I HEAR SOME REBEL ANIMALS ARE GIVING HER FOOD AND SHELTER!
[Ozian]
I HEAR HER SOUL IS SO UNCLEAN, PURE WATER CAN MELT HER!
[BURR]
 What?
[Ozia]

MELT HER! PLEASE SOMEBODY GO AND MELT HER!
[BURR]
 Do you hear that?! Water will melt her? People are so empty-headed they'll believe anything!
[Burr] Excuse me just a tick-tock!
Her And Fiyero Talk Aside.
[BURR]
 I can't just stand here grinning pretending to go along with all of this!
[Burr] Do you think I like to hear them say those awful things about her? I hate it!
[BURR]
 Then what are we doing here? Let's go, let's get out of here!
[Burr] We can't leave now, not when people are looking to us to raise their spirits.
[BURR]
 You can't leave, because you can't resist this. And that is the truth.
[Burr] Maybe I can't. Is that so wrong? Who could?
[BURR]
 You know who could. Who has.
[Burr] Fiyero, I miss her too, but we can't just stop living. No one has searched harder for her than you. But don't you see? She doesn't want to be found. We have to face it.
[BURR]
 You're right. I'm sorry, you're right. And if it's going tol make you happy, of course I'll marry you.
[Burr] But it'll make you happy too, right?
[BURR]
 You know me... I'm always happy. He Runs Off.
[Burr] Fiyero! Thanks plenty dearest! He's gone to fetch me a refreshment, he's so thoughtful that way!
THAT'S WHY I COULDN'T BE HAPPIER
NO, I COULDN'T BE HAPPIER
THOUGH IT IS I ADMIT, THE TINIEST BIT
UNLIKE I ANTICIPATED,
BUT I COULDN'T BE HAPPIER
SIMPLY COULDN'T BE HAPPIER...
Well, not simply...
'CUZ GETTING YOUR DREAMS, IT'S STRANGE BUT IT SEEMS
A LITTLE, WELL, COMPLICATED...
THERE'S A KIND OF A SORT OF COST
THERE'S A COUPLE OF THINGS GET LOST...
THERE ARE BRIDGES YOU CROSSED YOU DIDN'T KNOW YOU CROSSED UNTIL YOU'VE CROSSED!
AND IF THAT JOY THAT THRILL
DOESN'T THRILL LIKE YOU THINK IT WILL...
STILL... WITH THIS PERFECT FINALE
THE CHEERS AND THE BALLYHOO
WHO WOULDN'T BE HAPPIER?
SO I COULDN'T BE HAPPIER
BECAUSE HAPPY IS WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN ALL YOUR DREAMS COME TRUE...
WELL, ISN'T IT?
HAPPY IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOUR DREAMS COME...
TRUE!!!!
[Ozia]

WE LOVE YOU GLINDA IF WE MAY BE SO FRANK!
[Burr]
THANK GOODNESS!
[Ozia]

FOR ALL THIS JOY WE KNOW WHO WE'VE GOT TO THANK!
THANK GOODNESS!
THAT MEANS THE WIZARD, GLINDA...
[Burr]
AND FIANCE!
[Ozia]

WE COULDN'T BE LUCKIER!
[Burr] I COULDN'T BE HAPPIER!!!
[Ozia]
 THANK GOODNESS!!!
[Burr] TODAY!!!!
[Ozia]
 TODAY, THANK GOODNESS FOR TODAY!


[Angelica]
 Will there be anything else, Madame?
[Angelica]
 I've asked you to call me Nessarose, remember?
[Angelica]
 Yes, Madame. He Exits.
[Angelica]
 LAFAYETE...
Elphaba's Voice Is Heard Inside A Closet.
[HAMILTON] Well, it seems the beautiful only get more beautiful, Nessarose Screams while the green just get greener.
Nessarose Is Scared And Confused.
Elphaba Steps Out Of The Closet.
[HAMILTON] I'm sorry. Did I scare you? I seem to have that effect on people. It's good to see you.
[Angelica]
 What are you doing here?
[HAMILTON] Well, there's no place like home. I never thought I'd hear myself say this but I need father's help. I need him to stand with me.
[Angelica]
 That's impossible.
[HAMILTON] No, no it's not. Not if you ask him. You know he'll listen to you.
[Angelica]
 Father's dead.
[HAMILTON] What?
[Angelica]
 He's dead. I'm the governor... Well what did you expect? After he learned what you'd done,
how you'd disgraced u,s he died... of shame. Embarrassed to death.
[HAMILTON] Good, I'm glad. It's better that way.
[Angelica]
 That's a wicked thing to say.
[HAMILTON] No, it's true. Because now it's just us. You can help me and together we can...
[Angelica]
 Elphaba, shut up! First of all, I can't harbor a fugitive, I'm an un-elected official!
And why should I help you? You fly around [Oz, trying to rescue animals you've never even met,
and not once have you ever thought to use your powers to rescue me!
ALL OF MY LIFE, I'VE DEPENDED ON YOU
HOW DO YOU THINK THAT FEELS?
ALL OF MY LIFE I'VE DEPENDED ON YOU
AND THIS HIDEOUS CHAIR WITH WHEELS!
SCROUNGING FOR SCRAPS OF PITY TO PICK UP
AND LONGING TO KICK UP
MY HEELS...
[HAMILTON] Nessa, there isn't a spell for everything! The power is mysterious.
It's not like coddling up a pair of... She Pulls Out The Grimmerie From Her Bag. Wait.
[Angelica]
 What are you doing?
Elphaba Begins Chanting.
[Angelica]
 What is that? Ah! My shoes! It feels like... like they're on fire! What have you done to my shoes???
She Lifts Her Dress, Revealing The Ruby Slippers. Nessarose Stands, But Falls. Elphaba Gives Her A Hand.
[Angelica]
 No, don't help me. She Stands.
[HAMILTON] Oh, Nessa, at last...
I'VE DONE WHAT LONG AGO I SHOULD
AND FINALLY FROM THESE POWERS SOMETHING GOOD
FINALLY SOMETHING GOOD...
[Angelica]
 LAFAYETE! LAFAYETE! Come quickly!
[HAMILTON] LAFAYETE?
[Angelica]
 LAFAYETE! Come here at once!
[HAMILTON] No! Nessa, listen, nobody can know I'm here!
Nessarose Runs Behind The Closet As LAFAYETE Enters.
[Angelica]
 Yes, what is it, Madame?
[HAMILTON] LAFAYETE...
[Angelica]
 What are you doing here? You stay back!
[HAMILTON] LAFAYETE, it's just me, I'm not going to hurt you!
[Angelica]
 No! You're lying! That's all you ever do! You and your sister! She's as wicked as you are!
[HAMILTON] What are you talking about?
[Angelica]
 I'm talking about my life. The little that's left of it. I'm not free to leave Munchkinland, none of us are.
Ever since she took power, she's been stripping the Munchkins of our rights...
and we didn't have that many to begin with! And do you know why?
Nessarose Reveals Herself In The Chair.
[Angelica]
 To keep you here, with me. But none of that matters anymore. Look.
Nessarose Stands Up.
[Angelica]
 To Elphaba. You did this for her?
[Angelica]
 For both of us!
[Angelica]
 Nessa, this changes everything.
[Angelica]
 I know.
[Angelica]

LISTEN NESSA...
[Angelica]
 What?
[Angelica]

UH NESSA, SURELY NOW I'LL MATTER LESS TO YOU
AND YOU WON'T MIND MY LEAVING HERE TONIGHT...
[Angelica]
 Leaving?
[Angelica]
 Yes...
THAT BALL THAT'S BEING STAGED
ANNOUNCING GLINDA IS ENGAGED
[Angelica]
 Glinda?
[Angelica]

YES NESSA THAT'S RIGHT!
I'VE GOT TO GO APPEAL TO HER
EXPRESS THE WAY I FEEL TO HER
Oh, Nessa, I lost my heart to Glinda from the moment I first saw her. You know that.
[Angelica]
 Lost your heart? Well, we'll see about that...
[HAMILTON] Nessa, let him go...
[Angelica]

DID YOU THINK I'D LET YOU LEAVE ME HERE FLAT?
[Angelica]
 Don't come any closer!
YOU'RE GOING TO LOSE YOUR HEART TO ME, I TELL YOU!
IF I HAVE TO... I HAVE TO...
Sees The Grimmerie.
MAGIC SPELL YOU...
She Grabs The Book.
[Angelica]
 Ah... Tum... Tah... Tae...
Elphaba Reveals Herself.
[HAMILTON] Nessa, stop!
[Angelica]
 What is she doing?!
[HAMILTON] No, Nessa, you're pronouncing the words all wrong!
[HAMILTON] Nessa!
[Angelica]
 LAFAYETE! What is it?
[Angelica]
 Gasps. My heart feels like it's... shrinking.
[Angelica]
 Elphaba, do something!
[HAMILTON] I can't! You can't reverse a spell once it's been cast!
[Angelica]
 So what do we do?
LAFAYETE Falls Into Nessa's Empty Wheel Chair. Elphaba Wheels Him Behind The Closet.
[Angelica]
 Elphaba, do something!
[Angelica]
 This is all your fault! If you hadn't shown me that horrendible book.
[HAMILTON] I have to find another spell... it's the only thing that might work. She Goes Behind The Closet As Well.
[Angelica]
 Save him, please!
JUST SAVE HIM, MY POOR LAFAYETE, MY SWEET MY BRAVE,
DON'T LEAVE ME 'TIL MY SORRY LIFE HAS CEASED...
Elphaba Wheels The Chair Out, Which Is Not Facing The Audience And Is Seen Casting A Spell.
ALL ALONE AND LOVELESS HERE
JUST THE GIRL IN THE MIRROR
JUST HER AND ME! THE WICKED WITCH OF THE EAST!
WE DESERVE EACH OTHER...
[Angelica]
 Well... what about his heart?
[HAMILTON] It's all right. He won't need one now. I have to go. I have business to attend to in the Emerald City.
Nessa, I have done everything I could for you but it has never been enough and it never will be...
She Leaves.
[Angelica]
 Elphaba, wait! Elphaba!
LAFAYETE Wakes Up.
[Angelica]
 Where am I? What happened?
[Angelica]
 Nothing, LAFAYETE, you just fell asleep... and...
He Sits Up, Squeaking. He Is Made Of Tin. Nessarose Screams.
[Angelica]
 What is it, what's wrong?
[Angelica]
 No, it wasn't me it was her! I tried to stop her.
LAFAYETE Screams Uncontrollably And Runs Off.
[Angelica]
 LAFAYETE, please listen! It was Elphaba! LAFAYETE! It was Elphaba!!!

[Hamilton]
[HAMILTON] Well you have, you have harmed me.
[Hamilton]
I realize that, and I regret it. Elphaba...
[HAMILTON] There you are! I'm setting those monkeys free! And don't try to interfere, or call the guards...
[Hamilton]
I'm not calling anyone. The truth is I'm glad to see you again. It gets pretty lonely around here. And I know you must get lonely too.
[HAMILTON] You don't know the first thing about me.
[Hamilton]
Oh, but I do. I do know you. I can't explain it exactly. You know what I mean? Elphaba, you've been so strong through all of this, aren't you tired of being the strong one? Wouldn't you like someone to take care of you? He Hands Her Back The Broom. Please, help me start again.
[HAMILTON] Don't you think I wish I could? That I could go back to the time when I believed you really were wonderful? The Wonderful Wizard of [Oz? Nobody believed in you more than I did.
[Hamilton]
Oh, my dear child...
I NEVER ASKED FOR THIS OR PLANNED IT IN ADVANCE
I WAS MERELY BLOWN HERE BY THE WINDS OF CHANCE
I NEVER SAW MYSELF AS A SOLOMON OR SOCRATES
I KNEW WHO I WAS, ONE OF YOUR DIME A D[OzEN MEDIOCRATES
THEN SUDDENLY I'M HERE, RESPECTED, WORSHIPED EVEN
JUST BECAUSE THE FOLKS IN OzNEEDED SOMEONE TO BELIEVE IN
DOES IT SURPRISE YOU I GOT HOOKED AND ALL TOO SOON
WHAT CAN I SAY? I GOT CARRIED AWAY
AND NOT JUST BY BALLOON...
WONDERFUL
THEY CALLED ME WONDERFUL
SO I SAID, WONDERFUL, IF YOU INSIST
I WILL BE WONDERFUL
AND THEY SAID WONDERFUL
BELIEVE ME IT'S HARD TO RESIST
'CUZ IT FEELS WONDERFUL
THEY THINK I'M WONDERFUL
HEY LOOK WHO'S WONDERFUL
THIS CORN-FED HICK!
WHO SAID IT MIGHT BE KEEN
TO BUILD A TOWN OF GREEN
AND A WONDERFUL ROAD OF YELLOW BRICK!
See, I never had a family of my own since I was always traveling, and I guess I just wanted to give the citizens of Ozeverything.
[HAMILTON] So you lied to them?
[Hamilton]
Only verbally. Besides, they were the lies they wanted to hear. Elphaba, where I come from we believe all sorts of things that aren't true... we call it history!
A MAN'S CALLED A TRAITOR
OR LIBERATOR
A RICH MAN'S A THIEF
OR PHILANTHROPIST
IS ONE A CRUSADER
OR RUTHLESS INVADER
IT'S ALL IN THE LABEL WHICH IS ABLE TO PERSIST
THERE ARE PRECIOUS FEW AT EASE
WITH MORAL AMBIGUITIES
SO WE ACT AS THOUGH THEY DON'T EXIST...
THEY CALL ME WONDERFUL
SO I AM
INFACT, IT'S SO MUCH WHO I AM IT'S PART OF MY NAME!
AND WITH MY HELP YOU CAN BE THE SAME...
AT LONG, LONG LAST RECEIVE YOUR DUE
LONG OVERDUE
ELPHABA, THE MOST CELEBRATED
ARE THE REHABILITATED
THERE'LL SUCH A WHOOPDEE DOO!
A CELEBRATION THROUGHOUT [Oz,
THAT'S ALL TO DO WITH YOU!
WONDERFUL, THEY'LL CALL YOU WONDERFUL!
[HAMILTON]
THAT DOES SOUND WONDERFUL!
Wizard]
TRUST ME IT'S FUN!!!
Both]
WHEN YOU ARE WONDERFUL,
IT WOULD BE WONDERFUL!
WONDERFUL, WONDERFUL
Wizard]
ONE, TWO AND...
They Dance.
[HAMILTON]
I'LL ACCEPT YOUR PROPOSITION
[Hamilton]
Wonderful
[HAMILTON]
ON ONE CONDITION
[Hamilton]
Yes?
[HAMILTON] You set those Monkeys free.
[Hamilton]
Done.

[HAMILTON] Go! Fly! You're Free! Fly! Chistery, Chistery, you're free, isn't it wonderful?! Go, fly! She Makes Her Way To Another "Monkey" Covered By A Sheet.
[Hamilton]
No! No! Please!
She Pulls Off The Cover, Revealing Dr. Dillamond.
[HAMILTON] No! It can't be! Doctor Dillamond...
[Hamilton]
Elphaba, we just couldn't keep letting him speak out...
[HAMILTON] Doctor Dillamond, are you alright? Don't be afraid. It's me, Elphaba.
[Hamilton]
 Bahhhhh.
[HAMILTON] Doctor, don't you remember me?
[Hamilton]
 Bahhhhh.
[HAMILTON] Can't you speak?
[Hamilton]
 Bahhhhh.
[HAMILTON] No... We have nothing in common. I am nothing like you and I never will be and I will fight you until the day I die!!!
The Wizard Climbs Into The Head And Dr. Dillamond Runs Offstage.

[Hamilton]
Guards, guards!!!
Fiyero Runs In With His Men.
[Guard]
 Halt!
[BURR]
 Are you alright, your [Ozness?
[HAMILTON] Fiyero!
[BURR]
 I don't believe it...
[HAMILTON] Oh , Fiyero, thank God. I thought you were...
[BURR]
 Silence witch!!!
[Guard]
 There's a Goat on the lam, sir.
[BURR]
 Never mind all that. Fetch me some... some water.
[Guard]
 Water, sir?
[BURR]
 You heard me, as much as you can carry.
Guards] Yes, sir!
They March Off.
[HAMILTON] Fiyero...
[BURR]
 I said silence!
[Hamilton]
He Runs Out Of The Head. No! No!
[BURR]
 Don't make a sound, your [Ozness, unless you want all your guests to know the truth about the Wonderful Wizard of [Oz... Elphaba, I'll find Doctor Dillamond later, no get out of here.
[HAMILTON] Fiyero, you frightened me. I thought, I though you might have changed.
[BURR]
 I have... changed.
Glinda Enters.
[Burr] What's going on... Elphie? Oh, thank Ozyou're alive! Only you shouldn't have come. If anyone discoverates you ...
[BURR]
 Glinda, you'd better go.
[Burr] Fiyero, what are you...
[BURR]
 Please, just go back to the ball.
[Burr] Your [Ozness, he means no disrespectation. Please understand! You see, we all went to school together...
[BURR]
 Elphaba!
[Burr] Fiyero, have you misplaced your mind? What are you doing?
[BURR]
 I'm going with her.
[Burr] What? What are you saying? You mean all this time... the two of you... behind my back...
[HAMILTON] No, Glinda it wasn't like that!
[BURR]
 Actually, it was...but it wasn't...Elphaba, let's go... let's go!
They Run Off.
[Burr] Fine, go! You deserve each other...
The Wizard Holds A Small Bottle With A Green Liquid.
[Hamilton]
Here, have a swig of this, it dulls the pain.
[Burr] No, thank you.
Mme. Morrible Enters, Laughing.
[Morrible]
 Oh, is it true? Your betrothed has taken her into custody?
[Hamilton]
Our new captain of the guard had other plans.
[Morrible]
 You mean she hasn't been captured?
[Hamilton]
Quite the contrary. And considering how well she eluded us last time...
[Morrible]
 Well, we'll just flush her out and force her to show herself.
[Hamilton]
But how?
[Burr] Her sister
[Morrible]
 What? What did she say?
[Burr] Use her sister. Spread a rumor. Make her think her sister is in trouble and she will fly to her side... and you'll have her.
[Hamilton]
Exactly so.
[Burr] Now, if your [Ozness will excuse me I have a slight headache, I think I'll lie down.
She Walks Out.
[Morrible]
 Yes, well...a rumor won't do it. Elphaba's too smart for that.
[Hamilton]
Far too smart.
[Morrible]
 Perhaps, a change in the weather...

[Burr]
DON'T WISH, DON'T START
WISHING ONLY WOUNDS THE HEART...
THERE'S A GIRL I KNOW, HE LOVES HER SO...
I'M NOT THAT GIRL...

Only Elphaba & Fiyero Are On Stage, In The Woods
[HAMILTON]
KISS ME TOO FIERCELY, HOLD ME TOO TIGHT
I NEED HELP BELIEVING YOU'RE WITH ME TONIGHT
MY WILDEST DREAMINGS COULD NOT FORSEE
LYING BESIDE YOU WITH YOU WANTING ME
IF JUST FOR THIS MOMENT
AS LONG AS YOU'RE MINE
I'VE LOST ALL RESISTANCE
AND CROSSED SOME BORDERLINE
AND IF IT TURNS OUT
IT'S OVER TOO FAST
I'LL MAKE EVERY LAST MOMENT LAST
AS LONG AS YOU'RE MINE...
[BURR]

MAYBE I'M BRAINLESS, MAYBE I'M WISE,
BUT YOU'VE GOT ME SEEING THROUGH DIFFERENT EYES,
SOMEHOW I'VE FALLEN UNDER YOUR SPELL
AND SOMEHOW I'M FEELING
IT'S UP THAT I FELL
Both]
EVERY MOMENT, AS LONG AS YOU'RE MINE
I'LL WAKE UP MY BODY
AND MAKE UP FOR LOST TIME
[BURR]

SAY THERE'S NO FUTURE
FOR US AS A PAIR...
Both]
AND THOUGH I MAY KNOW,
I DON'T CARE
IF JUST FOR THIS MOMENT
AS LONG AS YOU'RE MINE
COME BE HOW YOU WANT TO
AND SEE HOW BRIGHT WE SHINE!
BORROW THE MOONLIGHT
UNTIL IT IS THROUGH
AND KNOW I'LL BE HERE HOLDING YOU...
AS LONG AS YOU'RE MINE...
[BURR]
 What is it?
[HAMILTON] It's just... for the first time... I feel... wicked.

[HAMILTON] I just wish...
[BURR]
 What?
[HAMILTON] I wish I could be beautiful... for you.
[BURR]
 Elphaba...
[HAMILTON] Don't tell me that I am, you don't need to lie to me.
[BURR]
 It's not lying! It's... uh... it's looking at things another way. Someday, you and Glinda will make up and we'll all...
[HAMILTON] Shh! Listen... Do you hear that? A Shriek Is Heard In The Distance. It sounds like somebody in pain.
[BURR]
 It's just the wind.
[HAMILTON] The Siren Is Heard Again. My sister's in danger.
[BURR]
 What? How do you know?
[HAMILTON] I don't know, I just do... Gasps.
[BURR]
 Elphaba what's wrong, what is it?
[HAMILTON] This! Don't you see it?
[BURR]
 What do you mean? What do you see?
[HAMILTON] It doesn't make any sense... It's a house but it's... it's flying through the sky? I have to go to Nessa!
[BURR]
 I'll come with you!
[HAMILTON] No, you mustn't, it's too dangerous!
[BURR]
 Listen to me, listen! My family has a castle in Kiamo Ko. Now, no one is ever there except for the sentries who watch over it. We've never lived there.
[HAMILTON] Where do you live?
[BURR]
 In the other castle... It's the perfect hiding place; tunnels, secret passageways. You'll be safe there.
[HAMILTON] We will see each other again, won't we?
[BURR]
 Elphaba, we are going to be together always. You can see houses flying through the sky, can't you see that?
They Embrace And Elphaba Runs Off.
Glinda Enters. There Is A House In The Background. The Edge OF The Yellow Brick Road Can Be Seen.
[Burr] That's right, you just take that one road, the whole time. Waves offstage. Oh, I hope they don't get lost. I'm so bad at giving directions. She sees the house, picks up flowers and lays them in front of the house. Oh, Nessa.
Elphaba Appears.
[HAMILTON] What a touching display of grief.
[Burr] I don't think we have anything further to say to one another.
[HAMILTON] I wanted something to remember her by, and all that is left were those shoes, and now that wretched little farm girl has walked off with them. So I'd appreciate some time, alone, to say goodbye to my sister.
Glinda Backs Away As Elphaba Walks Toward The House.
[HAMILTON] Nessa, please, please, please forgive me...
[Burr] Elphie... you mustn't blame yourself. It's dreadful, it is, to have a house fall on you, but accidents will happen.
[HAMILTON] You call this an accident?
[Burr] Yes! Well, maybe not an accident...
[HAMILTON] Well, what do you call it?
[Burr] Well... a regime change. Caused by a bizarre and unexpected twister of fate.
[HAMILTON] You think cyclones just appear out of the blue?
[Burr] I don't know, I never really...
[HAMILTON] No, of course you never! You're too busy telling everyone how wonderful everything is!
[Burr] I'm a public figure, now. People expect me to...
[HAMILTON] Lie?
[Burr] Be encouraging! And what exactly have you been doing besides riding around on that filthy, old thing?
[HAMILTON] Well, we can't all come and go by bubble. Who's invention was that, the Wizard's? Of course, even if it wasn't I'm sure he'd still take credit for it.
[Burr] Yes, well, a lot of us are taking things that don't belong to us, aren't we?
[HAMILTON] Now wait just a clock tick! I know it may be difficult for that blissful, blonde brain of yours to comprehend that someone like him could actually choose someone like me! But it's happened... it's real. And you can wave that ridiculous wand all you want, you can't change it! He never belonged to you, he doesn't love you, and he never did! He loves me!
Glinda Slaps Her.
[HAMILTON] Cackles. Feel better now?
[Burr] Yes, I do.
[HAMILTON] Good, so do I.
She Slaps Glinda. Glinda Then Twirls Her Wand Skillfully And Elphaba Arms Herself With Her Broom. They Charge At Each Other And Then Drop Their "Weapons" And Beat Each Other Senselessly. Glinda Takes Elphaba's Hat Off Her Head And Begins To Whack Her With It. The Guards Run In.
[Guard]
 Halt! In the name of the Wizard!
They Grab Elphaba.
[HAMILTON] Stop! Let me go!
[Burr] Let me go, I almost had her!
[Guard]
 Sorry it took us so long to get here, Miss.
[HAMILTON] I can't believe you would sink this low! To use my sister's death as a trap to capture me?!
[Burr] I never meant for this to happen! Elphie!
Fiyero Swings In On A Rope.
[BURR]
 Let the green girl go!
[Burr] Fiyero, how in [Oz?
[BURR]
 I said let her go! Or explain to all Ozhow the Wizard's guards watched while Glinda the Good was slain.
[Burr] Fiyero...
[BURR]
 I said, let her go.
The Guards Release Her.
[BURR]
 Elphaba, go, now.
[HAMILTON] No, not without you.
[Burr] Fiyero, please.
[BURR]
 Hush! Now! Go!
Elphaba Hesitates.
[Burr] Do it!
She Runs Off.
[Guard]
 Seize him!
[Burr] Wait, what?! What are you doing? Stop it! In the name of goodness, stop! Don't you see? He wasn't going to harm me, he just... he just... he loves her.
[BURR]
 Glinda, I'm so sorry!
[Guard]
 Take him up to that field there! Put him on one of those poles until he tells us where the witch went.
They Drag Him Offstage.
[Burr] No, don't hurt him! Please, don't hurt him! Fiyero!!!!
[HAMILTON] Fiyero!!!!
ELEKA NAHMEN NAHMEN ATUM ATUM ELEKA NAHMEN
ELEKA NAHMEN NAHMEN ATUM ATUM ELEKA NAHMEN
LET HIS FLESH NOT BE TORN LET HIS BLOOD LEAVE NO STAIN,
WILL THEY BEAT HIM, LET HIM FEEL NO PAIN...
LET HIS BONES NEVER BREAK AND HOWEVER THEY TRY TO DESTROY HIM,
LET HIM NEVER DIE, LET HIM NEVER DIE!
ELEKA NAHMEN NAHMEN ATUM ATUM ELEKA NAHMEN
ELEKA NAHMEN NAHMEN ATUM ATUM ELEKA... ELEKA
AH! WHAT GOOD IS THIS CHANTING?
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT I'M READING
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT TRICK I OUGHT TO TRY!
FIYERO WHERE ARE YOU?! ALREADY DEAD OR BLEEDING?
ONE MORE DISASTER I CAN ADD TO MY GENEROUS SUPPLY!
NO GOOD DEED GOES UNPUNISHED
NO ACT OF CHARITY GOES UNRESENTED
NO GOOD DEED GOES UNPUNISHED
THAT'S MY NEW CREED
MY ROAD OF GOOD INTENTIONS
LED WHERE SUCH ROADS ALWAYS LEAD
NO GOOD DEED
GOES UNPUNISHED!
NESSA...
DOCTOR DILLAMOND...
FIYERO...
FIYERO!!!
ONE QUESTION HAUNTS AND HURTS
TOO MUCH, TOO MUCH TO MENTION
WAS I REALLY SEEKING GOOD
OR JUST SEEKING ATTENTION?
IS THAT ALL GOOD DEEDS ARE WHEN LOOKED AT WITH AN ICE COLD EYE?
IF THAT'S ALL GOOD DEEDS ARE
MAYBE THAT'S THE REASON WHY
NO GOOD DEED GOES UNPUNISHED
ALL HELPFUL URGES SHOULD BE CIRCUMVENTED
NO GOOD DEED GOES UNPUNISHED
SURE, I MEANT WELL, WELL LOOK AT WHAT WELL MEANT DID!
ALRIGHT, ENOUGH, SO BE IT!
SO BE IT THEN...
LET ALL OF OzBE AGREED
I'M WICKED THROUGH AND THROUGH
SINCE I COULD NOT SUCCEED
FIYERO SAVING YOU
I PROMISE NO GOOD DEED WILL I ATTEMPT TO DO AGAIN
EVER AGAIN!
NO GOOD DEAD, WILL I DO
AGAIN!!!!!!!!

[Angelica]
 And, this is more than just a service to the Wizard. I have a personal score to settle with Elph... with the witch! Crowd Cheers.
IT'S DUE TO HER I'M MADE OF TIN
HER SPELL MADE THIS OCCUR
SO FOR ONCE I'M GLAD I'M HEARTLESS
I'LL BE HEARTLESS KILLING HER!
And I am not the only one. Looks Offstage. Oh, come on, you! Come out and tell them what she did to you in class that day. How you were just a cub and she cubnapped you.
Lion] No!
[Angelica]

YOU SEE THE LION ALSO
HAS A GRIEVANCE TO REPAY (Lion Roars)
IF SHE'D LET HIM FIGHT HIS OWN BATTLES WHEN HE WAS YOUNG,
HE WOULDN'T BE A COWARD TODAY!

[Burr] No, no, that's not the way it happened! Madame, you've got to stop this, it's gone too far!
[Morrible]
 Oh, I think Elphaba can take care of herself.
[Burr] Madame, something's been troubling me about Nessarose and that cyclone.
[Morrible]
 Oh yes... well, I guess it was just her time.
[Burr] Was it? Or did you...
[Morrible]
 After A Pause. Now, you listen to me, Missy, you may have fooled the rest of Ozwith this "aren't I good" routine, but you know better. You've wanted this since the beginning... and now you're getting what you wanted. So just smile and wave and shut up! Good fortune, good fortune witch hunters!
Rapid Man] Kill her!
Vicious Woman] Kill the witch!
WICKEDNESS MUST BE PUNISHED
BRAVE WITCH HUNTERS I WOULD JOIN YOU IF I COULD
BECAUSE WICKEDNESS MUST BE PUNISHED...
PUNISHED... PUNISHED...
BUT GOOD!!!
[HAMILTON] Oh, for [Oz's sake, stop crying!!! I can't listen to it anymore! Oh, you want to see your Aunt Em and your Uncle What's-his-name again?! Then get those shoes off your feet!!! Little brat... takes a dead woman's shoes; must have been raised in a barn! Chistery! Oh, Chistery, there you are. Where are the others? Chistery motions away. Chistery, please... if you don't at least try to keep speaking you will never... She Sees Glinda. Go away.
[Burr] They're coming for you.
[HAMILTON] Go away!
[Burr] Let the little girl go, and that poor little dog... Dodo.
[Burr] I know you don't want to hear this, but someone has to say it... You are out of control! I mean, come on! They're just shoes, let it go! Elphaba, you can't go on like this.
[HAMILTON] I can do anything I want. I am the Wicked Witch of the West! Another monkey Brings Her A Letter. At last! What took you so long? She Reads It. What's this? Why are you bothering me with this? She Reads On.
[Burr] What is it? What's wrong? It's Fiyero, isn't it? Is he...
[HAMILTON] We've seen his face for the last time.
[Burr] Oh no!
[HAMILTON] You're right... It's time I surrender. Carries A Bucket.
[Burr] Elphie.... Elphie, what is it?
[HAMILTON] You can't be found here! You must go. Refers To A Corner
[Burr] No.
[HAMILTON] You must leave.
[Burr] No! Elphie, I'll tell them everything.
[HAMILTON] No! They'll only turn against you.
[Burr] I don't care!
[HAMILTON] I do! Promise me, promise me, you won't try to clear my name... promise.
[Burr] Alright... I promise. But I don't understand.
[HAMILTON]
I'M LIMITED
JUST LOOK AT ME, I'M LIMITED
AND JUST LOOK AT YOU, YOU CAN DO ALL I COULDN'T DO, GLINDA

[HAMILTON] Here. Go on. Take this. Hands Her The Grimmerie.
[Burr] Elphie... you know I can't read that... Elphie...
[HAMILTON] Well then, you'll have to learn
NOW IT'S UP TO YOU
FOR BOTH OF US
NOW IT'S UP TO YOU
[HAMILTON] You're the only friend I've ever had.
[Burr] And I've had so many friends... but only one that mattered.

[Burr]
I'VE HEARD IT SAID
THAT PEOPLE COME INTO OUR LIVES FOR A REASON
BRINGING SOMETHING WE MUST LEARN
AND WE ARE LED TO THOSE
WHO HELP US MOST TO GROW
IF WE LET THEM
AND WE HELP THEM IN RETURN
WELL, I DON'T KNOW IF I BELIEVE THAT'S TRUE
BUT I KNOW I'M WHO I AM TODAY
BECAUSE I KNEW YOU
LIKE A COMMIT PULLED FROM ORBIT,
AS IT PASSES A SUN
LIKE A STREAM THAT MEETS A BOULDER
HALF WAY THROUGH THE WOOD
WHO CAN SAY IF I'VE BEEN CHANGED FOR THE BETTER?
BUT, BECAUSE I KNEW YOU...
I HAVE BEEN CHANGED
FOR GOOD...
[HAMILTON]
IT WELL MAY BE,
THAT WE WILL NEVER MEET AGAIN
IN THIS LIFETIME
SO LET ME SAY BEFORE WE PART

IS MADE OF WHAT I LEARNED FROM YOU
YOU'LL BE WITH ME
LIKE A HANDPRINT ON MY HEART...
AND NOW WHATEVER WAY OUR STORIES END
I KNOW YOU HAVE RE-WRITTEN MINE
BY BEING MY FRIEND...
LIKE A SHIP BLOWN FROM IT'S MOORING
BY A WIND OFF THE SEA
LIKE A SEA DROP BY A SKY BIRD
IN A DISTANT WOOD
WHO CAN SAY IF I'VE BEEN CHANGED FOR THE BETTER?
BUT BECAUSE I KNEW YOU
[Burr]
BECAUSE I KNEW YOU
Both]
I HAVE BEEN CHANGED...
FOR GOOD...
[HAMILTON]
AND JUST TO CLEAR THE AIR
I ASK FORGIVNESS FOR THE THINGS I'VE DONE
YOU BLAME ME FOR.
[Burr]
BUT THEN I GUESS, WE KNOW THERE'S BLAME TO SHARE
Both]
AND NONE OF IT SEEMS TO MATTER ANYMORE!
[Burr] LIKE A COMET PULLED FROM ORBIT AS IT PASSES A SUN...
[HAMILTON] LIKE A SHIP BLOWN FROM ITS MOORING BY A WIND OFF THE SEA
[Burr] LIKE A STREAM THAT MEETS A BOULDER
[HAMILTON] LIKE A SEA DROP BY A BIRD
[Burr] HALFWAY THROUGH THE WOOD
[HAMILTON] IN THE WOOD
[Burr]
WHO CAN SAY IF I'VE BEEN CHANGED FOR THE BETTER?
Both]
I DO BELIEVE I HAVE BEEN CHANGED FOR THE BETTER.
[Burr]
AND, BECAUSE I KNEW YOU
[HAMILTON]
BECAUSE I KNEW YOU
Both]
BECAUSE I KNEW YOU
I HAVE BEEN CHANGED
FOR GOOD...


[HAMILTON] You have to hide. No one can know you were here. Hide yourself!
Elphaba Drapes A Scrim Around The Stage
Offstage Chorus of Women]
AND GOODNESS KNOWS
THE WICKED'S LIVES ARE LONELY
GOODNESS KNOWS THE WICKED DIE ALONE...
LAFAYETE and Other Witch Hunters Run In. You Can See The Silhouette Of The Action Happening Behind The Scrim. Glinda Is Downstage Watching The Action Take Place.
The Mob Surrounds The Witch And She Melts With A Scream The Mob Leaves And Glinda Comes Out From Hiding. She Moves Near The Scrim.
[Burr] Elphie? Elphie? Chistery opens the scrim, where just Elphaba's hat and the green bottle remain. Glinda cries, and grabs the had, holding it against her.
Chistery] Handing Her The Bottle. Miss, Miss Glinda.
[Morrible]
 Well, I don't know why you're so despondiary, I thought it went quite well! They seem thrilled to shreds with their brains and their hearts, and this and that.... Glinda Enters. Oh, Miss Glinda! I thought you'd be out festivating.
[Burr] This was Elphaba's. Holding Out The Bottle.
[Hamilton]
What's that you say?
[Burr] It was a keepsake. It was her mother's. She told me so herself.
I've only seen a little, green bottle like this one other time. It was right here, in this very room. You offered me a drink from it.
Lover's Song Played In Background.
[Hamilton]
But... oh my Lord...
I AM A SENTIMENTAL MAN
WHO ALWAYS LONGED TO BE...
a father...
[Morrible]
 So that was it. That's why she had such powers! She was a child of both worlds!
[Hamilton]
He Cries.
[Burr] I want you to leave [Oz. I'll make the pronouncement myself]
that the strains of wizardship have been too much for you and you are taking an indefinite leave of absence! Did you hear what I said?!
[Hamilton]
Yes, your goodness.
[Burr] You'd better go get your balloon ready. Guards!
He Exits.
[Morrible]
 Glinda, dear, I know we've had our miniscule differentiations in the past...
[Burr] Guards! Madame, have you ever considered how you'd fare in captivity?
[Morrible]
 What?
[Burr] Articulated. Captivity... prison! Personally, I don't think you'll hold up very well.
My professional opinion is that you do not have what it takes. I hope you prove me wrong.
I doubt you will. Take her away!
[Morrible]
 No!!!!

[Ozia]

GOOD NEWS! SHE'S DEAD!
THE WITCH OF THE WEST IS DEAD!
THE WICKEDEST WITCH THERE EVER WAS
THE ENEMY OF ALL OF US, HERE IN [Oz,
IS DEAD!
GOOD NEWS
GOOD NEWS!!!
The Scarecrow (Fiyero) Walks On Stage. He Bends Down & Knocks On A Trap Door In The Floor.
[BURR]
 It worked!
He Opens The Door & Elphaba Climbs Out.
[HAMILTON] Fiyero! I thought you'd never get here.
She Touches His Straw Face.
[BURR]
 Go ahead, touch, I don't mind. Ah, you did the best you could. You saved my life.
[HAMILTON] You're still beautiful.
[BURR]
 You don't have to lie to me.
[HAMILTON] It's not lying... its looking at things another way.
[Ozia]

NO ONE MOURNS THE WICKED
NOW AT LAST SHE'S DEAD AND GONE!
NOW AT LAST THERE'S JOY THROUGHOUT THE LAND!
[Burr] Fellow [Ozians, friends, we have been through a frightening time. There will be other times
and other things that frighten us. But if you let me, I'd like to try to help. I'd like to try to be... Glinda the Good.
[Ozia]

GOOD NEWS!!
[BURR]
 It's time to go.
[HAMILTON] We can never come back to [Oz, can we?
[BURR]
 No.
[HAMILTON] I only wish...
[BURR]
 What?
[HAMILTON] Glinda could know that we're alive.
[BURR]
 She can't know, not if we want to be safe. No one can ever know.
[Ozia]

GOOD NEWS...
[BURR]
 Come...
[Burr]
WHO CAN SAY IF I'VE BEEN CHANGED FOR THE BETTER? BUT...
Elphaba & [Burr]
BECAUSE I KNEW YOU...
[Ozia]

NO ONE MOURNS THE WICKED...
[Burr]
BECAUSE I KNEW YOU...
Elphaba & [Burr]
I HAVE BEEN CHANGED...
Fiyero and Elphaba Leave Through The Clock
[Ozia]

NO ONE MOURNS THE WICKED!
WICKED...

Aaron Burr, Sir

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[COMPANY]
1776. New York City

[HAMILTON]
Pardon me. Are you Aaron Burr, sir?

[BURR]
That depends. Who's asking?

[HAMILTON]
Oh, well, sure, sir
I'm Alexander Hamilton, I'm at your service, sir
I have been looking for you

[BURR]
I'm getting nervous

[HAMILTON]
Sir...
I heard your name at Princeton. I was seeking an accelerated course of study when I got sort of out of sorts with a buddy of yours. I may have punched him. It's a blur, sir. He handles the financials?

[BURR]
You punched the bursar

[HAMILTON]
Yes!
I wanted to do what you did. Graduate in two, then join the revolution. He looked at me like I was stupid, I'm not stupid

So how'd you do it? How'd you graduate so fast?

[BURR]
It was my parents' dying wish before they passed

[HAMILTON]
You're an orphan. Of course! I'm an orphan
God, I wish there was a war!
Then we could prove that we're worth more
Than anyone bargained for...

[BURR]
Can I buy you a drink?

[HAMILTON]
That would be nice

[BURR]
While we're talking, let me offer you some free advice
Talk less

[HAMILTON]
What?

[BURR]
Smile more

[HAMILTON]
Ha

[BURR]
Don't let them know what you're against or what you're for

[HAMILTON]
You can't be serious

[BURR]
You wanna get ahead?

[HAMILTON]
Yes

[BURR]
Fools who run their mouths off wind up dead

[LAURE]

Yo yo yo yo yo!
What time is it?

[LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
Show time!

[BURR]
...like I said...

[LAURE]

Show time! Show time! Yo!
I'm John Laurens in the place to be!
Two pints o' Sam Adams, but I'm workin' on three, uh!
Those redcoats don't want it with me!
Cuz I will pop chick-a pop these cops till I'm free!

[LAFAYETTE]
Oui oui, mon ami, je m'appelle Lafayette!
The Lancelot of the revolutionary set!
I came from afar just to say "Bonsoir!"
Tell the King "Casse toi!" Who's the best?
C'est moi!

[MULLIGAN]
Brrrah brraaah! I am Hercules Mulligan
Up in it, lovin' it, yes I heard ya mother said "Come again?"
Lock up ya daughters and horses, of course
It's hard to have intercourse over four sets of corsets...

[LAURE]

No more sex, pour me another brew, son!
Let's raise a couple more...

[LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
To the revolution!

[LAURE]

Well, if it ain't the prodigy of Princeton college!

[MULLIGAN]
Aaron Burr!

[LAURE]

Give us a verse, drop some knowledge!

[BURR]
Good luck with that] you're takin' a stand
You spit. I'm ‘a sit. We'll see where we land

[LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
Boooo!

[LAURE]

Burr, the revolution's imminent. What do you stall for?

[HAMILTON]
If you stand for nothing, Burr, what'll you fall for?
[LAURE]

Ooh
Who are you? [MULLIGAN]
Ooh

Who are you? [LAFAYETTE]
Ooh

Who are you?

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE/LAURE]

Ooh, who is this kid? What's he gonna do?

My Shot

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[HAMILTON]
I am not throwing away my shot!
I am not throwing away my shot!
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot!
I'm ‘a get a scholarship to King's College
I prob'ly shouldn't brag, but dag, I amaze and astonish
The problem is I got a lot of brains but no polish
I gotta holler just to be heard
With every word, I drop knowledge!
I'm a diamond in the rough, a shiny piece of coal
Tryin' to reach my goal. My power of speech] unimpeachable
Only nineteen but my mind is older
These New York City streets get colder, I shoulder
Ev'ry burden, ev'ry disadvantage
I have learned to manage, I don't have a gun to brandish
I walk these streets famished
The plan is to fan this spark into a flame
But damn, it's getting dark, so let me spell out the name
I am the-

[HAMILTON/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN/LAURE]

A-L-E-X-A-N-D
E-R-we are-meant to be...

[HAMILTON]
A colony that runs independently
Meanwhile, Britain keeps shittin' on us endlessly
Essentially, they tax us relentlessly
Then King George turns around, runs a spending spree
He ain't ever gonna set his descendants free
So there will be a revolution in this century
Enter me!

[LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN/LAURE]

(He says in parentheses)

[HAMILTON]
Don't be shocked when your hist'ry book mentions me
I will lay down my life if it sets us free
Eventually, you'll see my ascendancy
[HAMILTON]
And I am not throwing away
My shot
I am not throwing away
My shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot
[LAURE]

My shot!

My shot!

And I'm not throwing away my shot.

[HAMILTON/MULLIGAN/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE]
I am not throwing away my shot
I am not throwing away my shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot
It's time to take a shot!

[LAFAYETTE]
I dream of life without a monarchy
The unrest in France will lead to ‘onarchy?
‘Onarchy? How you say, how you say, ‘anarchy?'
When I fight, I make the other side panicky
With my-

[HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
Shot!

[MULLIGAN]
Yo, I'm a tailor's apprentice
And I got y'all knuckleheads in loco parentis
I'm joining the rebellion cuz I know it's my chance
To socially advance, instead of sewin' some pants!
I'm gonna take a-

[HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
Shot!

[LAURE]

But we'll never be truly free
Until those in bondage have the same rights as you and me
You and I. Do or die. Wait till I sally in
On a stallion with the first black battalion
Have another-

[HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
Shot!

[BURR]
Geniuses, lower your voices
You keep out of trouble and you double your choices
I'm with you, but the situation is fraught
You've got to be carefully taught]
If you talk, you're gonna get shot!

[HAMILTON]
Burr, check what we got
Mister Lafayette, hard rock like Lancelot
I think your pants look hot
Laurens, I like you a lot
Let's hatch a plot blacker than the kettle callin' the pot...
What are the odds the gods would put us all in one spot
Poppin' a squat on conventional wisdom, like it or not
A bunch of revolutionary manumission abolitionists?
Give me a position, show me where the ammunition is!

Oh, am I talkin' too loud?
Sometimes I get over excited, shoot off at the mouth
I never had a group of friends before
I promise that I'll make y'all proud

[LAURE]

Let's get this guy in front of a crowd

[HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN/ENSEMBLE]
I am not throwing away my shot
I am not throwing away my shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot

I am not throwing away my shot
I am not throwing away my shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot
[LAURE]

Ev'rybody sing]
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Hey!
Whoa!
Wooh!!
Whoa!
Ay, let ‘em hear ya!

Let's go!

I said shout it to the rooftops!

When are these colonies gonna rise up?
When are these colonies gonna rise up?

Rise up!
[COMPANY]
Whoa! Whoa!
Whoa!

Whoa!

Rise up!

[HAMILTON]
I imagine death so much it feels more like a memory
When's it gonna get me?
In my sleep? Seven feet ahead of me?
If I see it comin', do I run or do I let it be?
Is it like a beat without a melody?
See, I never thought I'd live past twenty
Where I come from some get half as many
Ask anybody why we livin' fast and we laugh, reach for a flask
We have to make this moment last, that's plenty

Scratch that
This is not a moment, it's the movement
Where all the hungriest brothers with
Something to prove went?
Foes oppose us, we take an honest stand
We roll like Moses, claimin' our promised land
And? If we win our independence?
‘Zat a guarantee of freedom for our descendants?
Or will the blood we shed begin an endless
Cycle of vengeance and death with no defendants?
I know the action in the street is excitin'
But Jesus, between all the bleedin' ‘n fightin'
I've been readin' ‘n writin'
We need to handle our financial situation
Are we a nation of states? What's the state of our nation?
I'm past patiently waitin'. I'm passionately
Smashin' every expectation
Every action's an act of creation!
I'm laughin' in the face of casualties and sorrow
For the first time, I'm thinkin' past tomorrow

[HAMILTON AND COMPANY]
And I am not throwing away my shot
I am not throwing away my shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country

There's nothing rich folks love more

Farmer Refuted

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[SEABURY]
Hear ye, hear ye! My name is Samuel Seabury
And I present "Free Thoughts on the
Proceedings of the Continental Congress!"
Heed not the rabble who scream revolution
They have not your interests at heart

[MULLIGAN]
Oh my God. Tear this dude apart

[SEABURY]
Chaos and bloodshed are not a solution
Don't let them lead you astray
This Congress does not speak for me

[BURR]
Let him be

[SEABURY]
They're playing a dangerous game
I pray the king shows you his mercy
For shame, for shame...
[HAMILTON]
Yo!
He'd have you all unravel at the
Sound of screams but the
Revolution is comin'
The have-nots are gonna
Win this
It's hard to listen to you with a straight face

Chaos and bloodshed already haunt us, honestly you shouldn't even talk. And what about Boston? Look at the cost, n' all that we've lost n' you talk
About Congress?!

My dog speaks more eloquently than thee!

But strangely, your mange is the same

Is he in Jersey?

For the revolution!
[SEABURY]
Heed not the rabble
Who scream
Revolution, they
Have not your
Interests
At heart

Chaos and bloodshed are
Not a
Solution. Don't
Let them lead you
Astray
This Congress does not
Speak for me

They're playing a dangerous game

I pray the king shows you his mercy

For shame

For shame,

[COMPANY]
For the revolution!

[SEABURY]
Heed-

[HAMILTON]
If you repeat yourself again I'm gonna-

[SEABURY/HAMILTON]
Scream-

[HAMILTON]
Honestly, look at me, please don't read!

[SEABURY]
Not your interests-

[HAMILTON]
Don't modulate the key then not debate with me!
Why should a tiny island across the sea regulate the price of tea?

[BURR]
Alexander, please!

[HAMILTON]
Burr, I'd rather be divisive than indecisive, drop the niceties

Silence! A message from the King!

You'll Be Back

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[KING GEORGE]
You say
The price of my love's not a price that you're willing to pay
You cry
In your tea which you hurl in the sea when you see me go by
Why so sad?
Remember we made an arrangement when you went away
Now you're making me mad
Remember, despite our estrangement, I'm your man
You'll be back
Soon you'll see
You'll remember you belong to me
You'll be back
Time will tell
You'll remember that I served you well
Oceans rise
Empires fall
We have seen each other through it all
And when push
Comes to shove
I will send a fully armed battalion
To remind you of my love!

Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da
Da da dat dat da ya da!
Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da
Da da dat dat da...

You say our love is draining and you can't go on
You'll be the one complaining when I am gone...
And no, don't change the subject
Cuz you're my favorite subject
My sweet, submissive subject
My loyal, royal subject
Forever and ever and ever and ever and ever...

You'll be back
Like before
I will fight the fight and win the war
For your love
For your praise
And I'll love you till my dying days
When you're gone
I'll go mad
So don't throw away this thing we had

Cuz when push comes to shove
I will kill your friends and family to remind you of my love
Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da
Da da dat dat da ya da!
Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da
Da da dat-
Everybody!

[ENSEMBLE]
Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da
Da da dat dat da ya da!
Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da da da da

I knew that I was poor
I knew it was the only way to-

[HAMILTON/BURR/MULLIGAN/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE]
Rise up!

[HAMILTON]
If they tell my story
I am either gonna die on the battlefield in glory or-

[HAMILTON/BURR/MULLIGAN/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE]

We will fight for this land
But there's only one man
Who can give us a command so we can-

Rise up!

We gotta make an all out stand
Ayo, I'm gonna need a right-hand man.

Buck, buck, buck, buck, buck!

Buck, buck, buck, buck, buck!

[WASHINGTON]
Check it-
Can I be real a second?
For just a millisecond?
Let down my guard and tell the people how I feel a second?
Now I'm the model of a modern major general
The venerated Virginian veteran whose men are all
Lining up, to put me up on a pedestal
Writin' letters to relatives
Embellishin' my elegance and eloquence
But the elephant is in the room
The truth is in ya face when ya hear the British cannons go...

[ENSEMBLE]
Boom!

[WASHINGTON]
Any hope of success is fleeting
How can I keep leading when the people I'm
Leading keep retreating?
We put a stop to the bleeding as the British take Brooklyn
Knight takes rook, but look
[WASHINGTON]
We are outgunned

Outmanned

Outnumbered
Outplanned

We gotta make an all out stand
Ayo, I'm gonna need a right-hand man

Incoming!

Buck, buck, buck, buck, buck!

[MULLIGAN]

We gotta stop ‘em and rob ‘em of their advantages

[MULLIGAN]

[HAMILTON]
Let's take a stand with the stamina God has granted us
Hamilton won't abandon ship
Yo, let's steal their cannons-
[MULLIGAN]
Shh-boom! [COMPANY]
Boom!

[WASHINGTON]
Goes the cannon, watch the blood and the shit spray and...

[COMPANY]
Boom!

[WASHINGTON]
Goes the cannon, we're abandonin' Kips Bay and...

[COMPANY]

[WASHINGTON]
There's another ship and...

[COMPANY]
Boom!

[WASHINGTON]
We just lost the southern tip and...

[COMPANY]
Boom!

[WASHINGTON]
We gotta run to Harlem quick, we can't afford another slip
Guns and horses giddyup
I decide to divvy up
My forces, they're skittish as the British cut the city up
This close to giving up, facing mad scrutiny
I scream in the face of this mass mutiny]
Are these the men with which I am to defend America?
We ride at midnight, Manhattan in the distance
I cannot be everywhere at once, people
I'm in dire need of assistance...

[BURR]
Your excellency, sir!

[WASHINGTON]
Who are you?

[BURR]
Aaron Burr, Sir?
Permission to state my case?

[WASHINGTON]
As you were

[BURR]
Sir
I was a captain under General Montgomery
Until he caught a bullet in the neck in Quebec
And well, in summary
I think that I could be of some assistance
I admire how you keep firing on the British
From a distance

[WASHINGTON]
Huh

[BURR]
I have some questions, a couple of suggestions on how to fight instead of fleeing west

[WASHINGTON]
Yes?

[BURR]
Well-

[HAMILTON]
Your excellency, you wanted to see me?

[WASHINGTON]
Hamilton, come in, have you met Burr?

[HAMILTON]
Yes, sir

[HAMILTON AND BURR]
We keep meeting

[BURR]
As I was saying, sir, I look forward to seeing your strategy play out

[WASHINGTON]
Burr?

[BURR]
Sir?

[WASHINGTON]
Close the door on your way out

[HAMILTON]
Have I done something wrong, sir?

[WASHINGTON]
On the contrary
I called you here because our odds are beyond scary
Your reputation precedes you, but I have to laugh

[HAMILTON]
Sir?

[WASHINGTON]
Hamilton, how come no one can get you on their staff?

[HAMILTON]
Sir!

[WASHINGTON]
Don't get me wrong, you're a young man, of great renown
I know you stole British cannons when we were still downtown
Nathaniel Green and Henry Knox wanted to hire you...

[HAMILTON]
To be their Secretary? I don't think so

[WASHINGTON]
Why're you upset?

[HAMILTON]
I'm not-

[WASHINGTON]
It's alright, you want to fight, you've got a hunger
I was just like you when I was younger
Head full of fantasies of dyin' like a martyr?

[HAMILTON]
Yes

[WASHINGTON]
Dying is easy, young man. Living is harder

[HAMILTON]
Why are you telling me this?

[WASHINGTON]
I'm being honest
I'm working with a third of what our Congress has promised
We are a powder keg about to explode
I need someone like you to lighten the load. So?

[COMPANY (EXCEPT HAMILTON)]
I am not throwin' away my shot!
I am not throwin' away my shot!
Ayo, I'm just like my country, I'm young
Scrappy and hungry!

[HAMILTON]
I am not throwing away my shot!

[WASHINGTON]
Son

[WASHINGON AND COMPANY]
We are outgunned, outmanned!

[HAMILTON]
You need all the help you can get
I have some friends. Laurens, Mulligan
Marquis de Lafayette, okay, what else?

[WASHINGTON AND COMPANY]
Outnumbered, outplanned!

[HAMILTON]
We'll need some spies on the inside
Some King's men who might let some things slide
[HAMILTON]
I'll write to Congress and tell ‘em we need supplies, you rally the guys, master the element of surprise

I'll rise above my station, organize your information, ‘til we rise to the occasion of our new nation. Sir!

[ENSEMBLE]
Here comes the General!

A Winter's Ball

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[BURR]
How does the bastard, orphan, son of a whore
Go on and on
Grow into more of a phenomenon?
Watch this obnoxious, arrogant, loudmouth bother
Be seated at the right hand of the father
Washington hires Hamilton right on sight
But Hamilton still wants to fight, not write
Now Hamilton's skill with a quill is undeniable
But what do we have in common? We're
Reliable with the

[ALL MEN]
Ladies!

[BURR]
There are so many to deflower!

[ALL MEN]
Ladies!

Martha Washington named her feral tomcat after him!

Helpless!
Look into your eyes, and the sky's the limit I'm helpless!
Down for the count, and I'm drownin' in ‘em

[ELIZA]
I have never been the type to try and grab the spotlight
We were at a revel with some rebels on a hot night
Laughin' at my sister as she's dazzling the room
Then you walked in and my heart went "Boom!"
Tryin' to catch your eye from the side of the ballroom
Everybody's dancin' and the band's top volume

[ELIZA AND WOMEN]
Grind to the rhythm as we wine and dine
[ELIZA]
Grab my sister, and
Whisper, "Yo, this
One's mine."

My sister made her way across the room to you
And I got nervous, thinking "What's she gonna do?"
She grabbed you by the arm, I'm thinkin' "I'm through"
Then you look back at me and suddenly I'm
Helpless!

Oh, look at those eyes

Oh!
Yeah, I'm
Helpless, I know

I'm so into you
I am so into you

I know I'm down for the count
And I'm drownin' in ‘em.

[HAMILTON]
Schuyler?

[ANGELICA]
My sister

[ELIZA]
Thank you for all your service

[HAMILTON]
If it takes fighting a war for us to meet, it will have been worth it

[ANGELICA]
I'll leave you to it

[ELIZA AND WOMEN]
One week later

[ELIZA]
I'm writin' a letter nightly
Now my life gets better, every letter that you write me
Laughin' at my sister, cuz she wants to form a harem

[ANGELICA]
I'm just sayin', if you really loved me, you would share him
[ELIZA]
Ha!
Two weeks later
In the living room stressin'
My father's stone-faced
While you're asking for his blessin'
I'm dying inside, as
You wine
And dine
And I'm tryin' not to cry
‘cause there's nothing that your mind can't do
My father makes his way across the room
To you
I panic for a second, thinking
"we're through"
But then he shakes your hand and says
"Be true"
And you turn back to me, smiling, and I'm
Helpless!

Helpless!
Hoo!

That boy is mine
That boy is mine!

Helpless! Helpless!
Down for the count

Look into your eyes

Down for the count
And I'm drownin' in em

[HAMILTON]
Eliza, I don't have a dollar to my name
An acre of land, a troop to command, a dollop of fame
All I have's my honor, a tolerance for pain
A couple of college credits and my top-notch brain
Insane, your family brings out a different side of me
Peggy confides in me, Angelica tried to take a bite of me
No stress, my love for you is never in doubt
We'll get a little place in Harlem and we'll figure it out
I've been livin' without a family since I was a child
My father left, my mother died, I grew up buckwild
But I'll never forget my mother's face, that was real
And long as I'm alive, Eliza, swear to God
You'll never feel so...

[HAMILTON]
Eliza...

I've never felt so-

My life is gon' be fine cuz Eliza's in it.
[ELIZA]
I do I do I do I do!

I do I do I do I do!

Hey, yeah, yeah!

I'm down for the count
I'm-

I look into your eyes, and the sky's the limit
I'm

Alright, alright. That's what I'm talkin' about!
Now everyone give it up for the maid of honor
Angelica Schuyler!
[ANGELICA]
A toast to the groom!

To the bride!

From your sister

Who is always by your side

To your union

And the hope that you provide

May you always...

Be satisfied.

[ALL MEN]
To the groom!

[ELIZA AND WOMEN]
Angelica!

By your side!

To the union!
To the revolution!

You provide!

Always-

Rewind-

[ANGELICA]
I remember that night, I just might
Regret that night for the rest of my days

I remember those soldier boys
Tripping over themselves to win our praise

I remember that dreamlike candlelight
Like a dream that you can't quite place

But Alexander, I'll never forget the first
Time I saw your face

I have never been the same
Intelligent eyes in a hunger-pang frame
And when you said "Hi," I forgot my dang name
Set my heart aflame, ev'ry part aflame

[FULL COMPANY]
This is not a game...

[HAMILTON]
You strike me as a woman who has never been satisfied

[ANGELICA]
I'm sure I don't know what you mean. You forget yourself

[HAMILTON]
You're like me. I'm never satisfied

[ANGELICA]
Is that right?

[HAMILTON]
I have never been satisfied

[ANGELICA]
My name is Angelica Schuyler

[HAMILTON]
Alexander Hamilton

[ANGELICA]
Where's your fam'ly from?

[HAMILTON]
Unimportant. There's a million things I haven't done but
Just you wait, just you wait...

[ANGELICA]
So so so-
So this is what it feels like to match wits
With someone at your level! What the hell is the catch? It's
The feeling of freedom, of seein' the light
It's Ben Franklin with a key and a kite! You see it, right?
The conversation lasted two minutes, maybe three minutes
Ev'rything we said in total agreement, it's
A dream and it's a bit of a dance
A bit of a posture, it's a bit of a stance. He's a
Bit of a flirt, but I'm ‘a give it a chance
I asked about his fam'ly, did you see his answer?
His hands started fidgeting, he looked askance?
He's penniless, he's flying by the seat of his pants

Handsome, boy, does he know it!
Peach fuzz, and he can't even grow it!
I wanna take him far away from this place
Then I turn and see my sister's face and she is...

[ELIZA]
Helpless...

[ANGELICA]
And I know she is...

[ELIZA]
Helpless...

[ANGELICA]
And her eyes are just...

[ELIZA]
Helpless...

[ANGELICA]
And I realize

[ANGELICA AND COMPANY]
Three fundamental truths at the exact same time...

[HAMILTON]
Where are you taking me?

[ANGELICA]
I'm about to change your life

[HAMILTON]
Then by all means, lead the way

[COMPANY (EXCEPT ANGELICA)]
Number one!

[ANGELICA]
I'm a girl in a world in which
My only job is to marry rich
My father has no sons so I'm the one
Who has to social climb for one
So I'm the oldest and the wittiest and the gossip in
New York City is insidious
Alexander is penniless
Ha! That doesn't mean I want him any less

[ELIZA]
Elizabeth Schuyler. It's a pleasure to meet you

[HAMILTON]
Schuyler?

[ANGELICA]
My sister

[COMPANY]
Number two!

[ANGELICA]
He's after me cuz I'm a Schuyler sister
That elevates his status, I'd
Have to be naïve to set that aside
Maybe that is why I introduce him to Eliza
Now that's his bride
Nice going, Angelica, he was right
You will never be satisfied

[ELIZA]
Thank you for all your service

[HAMILTON]
If it takes fighting a war for us to meet, it will have been worth it

[ANGELICA]
I'll leave you to it

[COMPANY]
Number three!

[ANGELICA]
I know my sister like I know my own mind
You will never find anyone as trusting or as kind
If I tell her that I love him she'd be silently resigned
He'd be mine
She would say, "I'm fine"

[ANGELICA AND COMPANY]
She'd be lying

[ANGELICA]
But when I fantasize at night
It's Alexander's eyes
As I romanticize what might
Have been if I hadn't sized him
Up so quickly
At least my dear Eliza's his wife;
At least I keep his eyes in my life...
[ANGELICA]
To the groom!

To the bride!

From your sister

Who is always by your side

To your union

And the hope that you provide

May you always

Be satisfied

And I know

She'll be happy as

His bride
And I know [ALL MEN (EXCEPT HAMILTON)]
To the groom!

The Story of Tonight (Reprise)

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[LAURE]

I may not live to see our glory!

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE]
I may not live to see our glory!

[LAURE]

But I've seen wonders great and small

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE]
I've seen wonders great and small

[LAURE]

‘Cause if the tomcat can get married

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE]
If Alexander can get married-

[LAURE]

There's hope for our ass, after all!

[LAFAYETTE]
Raise a glass to freedom

[LAURENS/MULLIGAN]
Hey!
Something you will never see again!

[MULLIGAN]
No matter what she tells you

[LAFAYETTE]
Let's have another round tonight!

[LAURE]

Raise a glass to the four of us!

[LAFAYETTE/HAMILTON]
Ho!

[MULLIGAN]
To the newly not poor of us!

[LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/HAMILTON]
Woo!

[LAFAYETTE]
We'll tell the story of tonight

[LAURE]

Let's have another round-

[HAMILTON]
Well, if it isn't Aaron Burr

[BURR]
Sir!

[HAMILTON]
I didn't think that you would make it

[BURR]
To be sure

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE]
Burr!

[BURR]
I came to say congratulations

[MULLIGAN]
Spit a verse, Burr!

[BURR]
I see the whole gang is here

[LAFAYETTE]
You are the worst, Burr!

[HAMILTON]
Ignore them. Congrats to you, Lieutenant Colonel
I wish I had your command instead of manning George's journal

[BURR]
No, you don't

[HAMILTON]
Yes, I do

[BURR]
Now, be sensible
From what I hear, you've made yourself indispensable

[LAURE]

Well, well, I heard
You've got a special someone on the side, Burr

[HAMILTON]
Is that so?

[LAURE]

What are you tryin' to hide, Burr?

[BURR]
I should go

[HAMILTON]
No, these guys should go

[LAFAYETTE]
What?

[LAURE]

No!

[HAMILTON]
Leave us alone

[MULLIGAN]
Man...

[HAMILTON]
It's alright, Burr. I wish you'd brought this girl with you tonight, Burr

[BURR]
You're very kind, but I'm afraid it's unlawful, sir

[HAMILTON]
What do you mean?

[BURR]
She's married

[HAMILTON]
I see

[BURR]
She's married to a British officer

[HAMILTON]
Oh shit...

[BURR]
Congrats again, Alexander. Smile more
I'll see you on the other side of the war

[HAMILTON]
I will never understand you
If you love this woman, go get her! What are you waiting for?

[BURR]
I'll see you on the other side of the war

[HAMILTON]
I'll see you on the other side of the war

Wait For It

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[BURR]
Theodosia writes me a letter everyday
I'm keeping the bed warm while her husband is away
He's on the British side in Georgia
He's trying to keep the colonies in line
But he can keep all of Georgia
Theodosia, she's mine

Love doesn't discriminate
Between the sinners
And the saints
It takes and it takes and it takes
And we keep loving anyway
We laugh and we cry
And we break
And we make our mistakes
And if there's a reason I'm by her side
When so many have tried
Then I'm willing to wait for it
I'm willing to wait for it
[BURR]
My grandfather was a fire and brimstone preacher

But there are things that the
Homilies and hymns won't teach ya

My mother was a genius

My father commanded respect

When they died they left no instructions
Just a legacy to protect

[MEN]
Preacher, preacher
Preacher

Teach ya, teach ya, teach ya

Respect, respect

[WOMEN]
Genius


[LAURE]

GOOD NEWS, SHE'S DEAD!
THE WITCH OF THE WEST IS DEAD!
THE WICKEDEST WITCH THERE EVER WAS,
THE ENEMY OF ALL OF US HERE IN [,
IS DEAD! GOOD NEWS! GOOD NEWS!

[LAURE]

Look, it's Glinda!


[LAURE]

floats in on a giant bubble

[LAURE]

 It's good to see me, isn't it? ([Ozians Agree) No need to respond that was rhetorical. Fellow [Ozia]


[BURR]
LET US BE GLAD,
LET US BE GRATEFUL,
LET US REJOICIFY THAT GOODNESS COULD SUBDUE
THE WICKED WORKINGS OF YOU KNOW WHO!
ISN'T IT NICE TO KNOW
THAT GOOD WILL CONQUER EVIL?
THE TRUTH WE ALL BELIEVE'LL BY AND BY
OUTLIVE A LIE
FOR YOU AND...

[BURR]
Glinda! Exactly how dead is she?

[[Burr] Well, there has been much rumor and speculation... innuendo, outuendo...
but let me set the record straight. According to the Time Dragon Clock, the melting occurred at the 13th hour;
a direct result of a bucket of water thrown by a female child. Yes, the Wicked Witch of the West is dead!

[Ozian]
NO ONE MOURNS THE WICKED!

[Ozian]
NO ONE CRIES THEY WON'T RETURN!

[Ozia]

NO ONE LAYS A LILY ON THEIR GRAVE!
[Ozian Man]
THE GOOD MAN SCORNS THE WICKED!
Women]
THROUGH THEIR LIVES OUR CHILDREN LEARN!

[Ozia]

WHAT WE MISS WHEN WE MISBEHAVE!
[Burr]
AND GOODNESS KNOWS
THE WICKEDS' LIVES ARE LONELY
GOODNESS KNOWS
THE WICKED DIE ALONE
IT JUST SHOWS WHEN YOU'RE WICKED
YOU'RE LEFT ONLY
ON YOUR OWN
[Ozia]

YES, GOODNESS KNOWS
THE WICKEDS' LIVES ARE LONELY
GOODNESS KNOWS
THE WICKED CRY ALONE
NOTHING GROWS FOR THE WICKED
THEY REAP ONLY
WHAT THEY'VE SEWN
[Ozian] Glinda, why does wickedness happen?
[Burr] That's a good question; one that many people find confusifying. Are people born wicked,
or do they have wickedness thrust upon them? After all, she had a childhood,;
She had a father, who just happed to be the governor of munchlinkland Witch's Parents Enter.

[Frex]
 I'm off to the assembly, dear.
[Burr] She had a mother, as so many do...
[Frex]

HOW I HATE TO GO AND LEAVE YOU LONELY
Melena]
THAT'S ALRIGH IT'S ONLY JUST ONE NIGHT
[Frex]

BUT KNOW THAT YOU'RE HERE, IN MY HEART
WHILE I'M OUT OF YOUR SIGHT!
Frex Exits. A Lover Runs Into The Room.
[Burr] And like all families, they had their secrets.
Lover]
HAVE ANOTHER DRINK, MY DARK EYED BEAUTY,
I'VE GOT ONE MORE NIGHT LEFT HERE IN TOWN,
SO HAVE ANOTHER DRINK OF GREEN ELIXER
AND WE'LL HAVE OURSELVES A LITTLE MIXER
HAVE ANOTHER LITTLE SWALLOW LITTLE LADY,
AND FOLLOW ME DOWN
[Burr] And of course, from the moment she was born she was... well... different!
Midwife] AHHH!! It's coming!
[Frex]
 Now?
Midwife] The baby's coming!
[Frex]
 And how!

Midwife]
I SEE A NOSE!
[Frex]

I SEE A CURL!
Both]
IT'S A HEALTHY, PERFECT, LOVELY LITTLE...
(They Scream)
Melena] What is it? What's wrong?
Midwife]
HOW CAN IT BE?
[Frex]

WHAT DOES IT MEAN?
Midwife]
IT'S ATTROCIOUS!
[Frex]

IT'S OBSCENE!
Both]
LIKE A FROGGY, FERNY CABBAGE,
THE BABY IS UNATURALLY
GREEN!!!
[Frex]
 Take it away... Take it away!!!!
[Burr] So you see, it couldn't have been easy!

Munchki]

NO ONE MOURNS THE WICKED!
NOW AT LAST, SHE'S DEAD AND GONE!
NOW AT LAST THERE'S JOY THROUGHOUT THE LAND!
AND GOODNESS KNOWS (GOODNESS KNOWS)
WE KNOW WHAT GOODNESS IS (OOOOHHHH)
GOODNESS KNOWS, THE WICKED DIE ALONE (SHE DIED ALONE)
WOE TO THOSE (WOE TO THOSE)
WHO SPURN WHAT GOODNESSES THEY ARE SHOWN!
NO ONE MOURNS THE WICKED (GOOD NEWS)
NO ONE MOURNS THE WICKED (GOOD NEWS)
NO ONE MOURNS... THE WICKED...
WICKED...
WICKED!!!!!
[Burr] Well, this has been fun! But as you can imagine I have much to attend to,
what with the Wizard's unexpected departure. So, if there are no further questions...
[Ozian] Glinda, is it true you were her friend?
[Ozians Gasp
[Burr] Well, I... you see... um... yes.
Louder Gasps
[Burr] Well, it depends on what you mean by "friend". She Motions Her Bubble Downward.
I did know her. That is, our paths did cross... at school. But you must understand, it was a long time ago and we were both very young.

[Students]

O, HALLOWED HALLS AND VINE DRAPED WALLS
THE PROUDLIEST SITE THERE IS.
WHEN GREY AND SEER OUR HAIR HATH TURNED,
WE SHALL STILL REVERE THE LESSONS LEARNED
IN OUR DAYS AT DEAR OLD SHIZ (DEAR OLD SHIZ)
OUR DAYS AT DEAR OLD...
[linda]

 Being Wheeled In On A Big Cart Filled With Luggage.
OOOOOOOOOOLD
All]
SHIZZZZZZZZZZZ (DEAR OLD SHIZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ)
Frex Wheels Nessarose On Stage.
[HAMILTON]
 What?! What are you looking at? Oh, do I have something in my teeth?
Okay, let's get this over with. No, I'm not seasick, yes, I've always been green, no, I didn't chew grass as a child.
[Frex]
 Elphaba!
[HAMILTON] Oh, this is my younger sister, Nessarose. As you can see, she is a perfectly normal color.
[Frex]
 Elphaba, stop making a spectacle of yourself! I'm only sending you here for one reason...
[HAMILTON] Yes, I know, to look after Nessarose.
Frex Holds Out A Box.
[Frex]
 My precious little girl] a parting gift.
[Angelica]
 Now, father... He Pulls Silver Shoes From The Box. Jeweled shoes!
[Frex]
 As befits the future governor of Munchkinland. Elphaba, take care of your sister.
And try not to talk so much! He Kisses Nessarose And Exits.
[Angelica]
 Elphaba...
[HAMILTON] Well what could he have gotten me? I clash with everything!
Mme. Morrible Enters
[Morrible]
 Welcome, new students! I am Madame Morrible, headmistress here, at Shiz University.
And whether you're here to study logic, literature, or linguification,
I know I speak for my fellow faculty members when I say we have nothing but the highest hopes for some of you.
Now, regarding room assignments... Elphaba & Galinda Raise Their Hands.
She Notices Galinda First. Yes, is this regarding room assignments?
[linda]

 Oh, Madame, thank you for asking, but I've already been assigned a private suite...
Noticing Her Followers' Disappointment. But you can all come visit me whenever you want!
Shen Shen] How good of you!
Pfanee] You are so good!
[linda]

 No I'm not!
Both] Yes you are!
[linda]

 Now stop! Swishes Her Hair.
[Morrible]
 Do you have a question?

[linda]

 Yes, you see, I am Galinda Upland of the Upperuplands... I've applied to your sorcery seminar,
and indeed that is my sole purpose of attending Shiz; to study sorcery with you.
Perhaps you recall my essay, "Magic Wands, Need They Have A Point".
[Morrible]
 Yes... However, I do not teach my seminar every semester, unless, of course, somebody special were to come along.
[linda]

 Well, exactly!
[HAMILTON] We have not yet received our room assignments.
[Morrible]
 Yes, yes, of course! Oh, You must be Miss Nessarose, the governor's daughter.
What a tragically beautiful face you have! Sees Elphaba, snorts...And you must be.
[HAMILTON] I'm the other daughter. Elphaba. I'm beautifully tragic.
[Morrible]
 Yes, yes, I'm sure you're very bright.
[linda]

 Bright? She's phosphorescent.
[Morrible]
 I don't seem to have you on my list. Oh, well a slight gulch, but not to fret! We'll find someplace to put you.
[linda]

 Y'know, I don't even think she read my essay.
Shen Shen] That's so unfair!
[Angelica]
 You should say something!
[linda]

 Should I?
Pfanee] Do it!
[Morrible]
 Now, which one of you young ladies would like to volunteer to share with Miss Elphaba?
[linda]

 Madame Morrible...
[Morrible]
 Thank you dear. Oh, how very good of you!
[linda]

 What?
[Morrible]
 Miss Elphaba, you may share with Miss Galinda.
[linda]

 Huh?
[Morrible]
 The governor made his concern for your sister's well being quite clear.
So, I thought it would be best if she share my private compartment where I can assist her as needed...
[HAMILTON] But Madame, I've always looked after my sister.
[Morrible]
 Everyone, to your dormitories.
[HAMILTON] But Madame...
[HAMILTON] Let her go!!!
Nessarose's Wheelchair Is Torn From Morrible's Hands And Begins To Wheel Itself Back To Elphaba.
[Morrible]
 How did you do that?
[linda]

 How did she do that?
[Angelica]
 Elphaba!
[Morrible]
 You mean this has happened before?
[HAMILTON] Uh... Something just comes over me sometimes... I'm sorry, Madame.
[Morrible]
 What? Never apologize for talent! Talent is a gift! Have you ever considered a career in sorcery?
[HAMILTON] Sorcery?
[Morrible]
 I shall tutor you myself, and take no other students.
[linda]

 What?
All Students But Galinda Exit.
[Morrible]
 Oh, Miss Elphaba...
MANY YEARS I HAVE WAITED
FOR A GIFT LIKE YOURS TO APPEAR
WHY I PREDICT THE WIZARD COULD MAKE YOU HIS
MAGIC, GRAND VIZIER!
MY DEAR, MY DEAR,
I'LL WRITE AT ONCE TO THE WIZARD
TELL HIM OF YOU IN ADVANCE
WITH A TALENT LIKE YOURS, DEAR, THERE IS
A DEFIN-ISH CHANCE
IF YOU WORK AS YOU SHOULD
YOU'LL BE MAKING GOOD
[linda]

 Madame Morrible...
[Morrible]
 No, not now dearest. She Exits.
[Burr] This will just make me a better person. She simles.
She Runs Off.

[HAMILTON]
DID THAT REALLY JUST HAPPEN?
HAVE I ACTUALLY UNDERSTOOD?
THIS WEIRD QUIRK I'VE TRIED TO SURPRESS OR HIDE
IS A TALENT THAT COULD HELP ME MEET THE WIZARD
IF I MAKE GOOD
SO I'LL MAKE GOOD.
WHEN I MEET THE WIZARD,
ONCE I PROVE MY WORTH,
AND THEN I MEET THE WIZARD,
WHAT I'VE WAITED FOR SINCE
SINCE BIRTH!
AND WITH ALL HIS WIZARD WISDOM
BY MY LOOKS HE WON'T BE BLINDED
DO YOU THINK THE WIZARD IS DUMB?
OR LIKE MUNCHKINS SO SMALL-MINDED? NO!
HE'LL SAY TO ME "I SEE WHO YOU TRULY ARE,
A GIRL ON WHOM I CAN RELY"
AND THAT'S HOW WE'LL BEGIN,
THE WIZARD AND I
ONCE I'M WITH THE WIZARD,
MY WHOLE LIFE WILL CHANGE,
'CUZ ONCE YOU'RE WITH THE WIZARD
NO ONE THINKS YOU'RE STRANGE
NO FATHER IS NOT PROUD OF YOU,
NO SISTER ACTS ASHAMED,
AND ALL OF OzHAS TO LOVE YOU
WHEN BY THE WIZARD YOU'RE ACLAIMED
AND THIS GIFT OR THIS CURSE
THAT I HAVE INSIDE
MAYBE AT LAST I'LL KNOW WHY
WHEN WE ARE HAND IN HAND,
THE WIZARD AND I
AND ONE DAY HE'LL SAY TO ME, "ELPHABA,
A GIRL WHO IS SO SUPERIOR,
SHOULDN'T A GIRL WHO'S SO GOOD INSIDE
HAVE A MATCHING EXTERIOR?
AND SINCE FOLKS HERE TO AN OBSURED DEGREE
SEEM FIXATED ON YOUR VERDEGRIS
WOULD IT BE ALRIGHT BY YOU
IF I DEGREENIFY YOU?"
AND OF COURSE THAT'S NOT IMPORTANT TO ME
"ALRIGHT! WHY NOT?" I'LL REPLY
OH, WHAT A PAIR WE'LL BE
THE WIZARD AND I
YES, WHAT A PAIR WE'LL BE
THE WIZARD AND...
UNLIMITED, MY FUTURE IS UNLIMITED
AND I'VE JUST HAD A VISION ALMOST LIKE A PROPHECY
I KNOW
IT SOUNDS TRULY CRAZY
AND TRUE, THE VISION'S HAZY
BUT I SWEAR SOME DAY THERE'LL BE
A CELEBRATION THROUGHOUT [Oz
THAT'S ALL TO DO
WITH ME!
AND I'LL STAND THERE WITH THE WIZARD
FEELING THINGS I'VE NEVER FELT
AND THOUGH I'D NEVER SHOW IT
I'D BE SO HAPPY I COULD MELT!
AND SO IT WILL BE FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE
AND I'LL WANT NOTHING ELSE 'TILL I DIE
HELD IN SUCH HIGH ESTEEM!
WHEN PEOPLE SEE ME THEY WILL SCREAM
FOR HALF OF [Oz'S FAVORITE TEAM]
THE WIZARD...
AND I!!!!

[linda]

 Dearest, Darlingest Momsy and Popsicle...
[HAMILTON] My dear father...
Both]
THERE'S BEEN SOME CONFUSION OVER ROOMING HERE AT SHIZ
[HAMILTON]
BUT, OF COURSE, I'LL CARE FOR NESSA...
[linda]


BUT, OF COURSE, I'LL RISE ABOVE IT...
Both]
FOR I KNOW THAT'S HOW YOU'D WANT ME TO RESPOND
Yes...
THERE'S BEEN SOME CONFUSION FOR YOU SEE MY ROOMATE IS...
[linda]


UNUSUALLY, AND EXCEEDLINGLY PECULIAR AND ALTOGETHER QUITE IMPOSSIBLE TO DESCRIBE...
[HAMILTON] Blonde.
[linda]


WHAT IS THIS FEELING, SO SUDDEN AND NEW?
[HAMILTON]
I FELT THE MOMENT I LAID EYES ON YOU!
[linda]


MY PULSE IS RUSHING...
[HAMILTON]
MY HEAD IS REELING...
[linda]


MY FACE IS FLUSHING...

EVERY LITTLE TRAIT HOWEVER SMALL

WITH SIMPLE, UTTER LOATHING
THERE'S A STRANGE EXHILARTION

IT'S SO PURE, SO STRONG!
THOUGH, I DO ADMIT IT CAME ON FAST,
STILL I DO BELIEVE THAT IT CAN LAST!
AND I WILL BE LOATHING, LOATHING YOU
MY WHOLE LIFE LONG!
[Students]

DEAR GALINDA, YOU ARE JUST TOO GOOD!
HOW DO YOU STAND IT, I DON'T THINK I COULD!
SHE'S A TERROR! SHE'S A TARTAR!
WE DON'T MEAN TO SHOW A BIAS,
BUT GALINDA, YOU'RE A MARTAR!
[linda]

 Well...

[Students]

Both] MY WHOLE LIFE LONG!!!!
[HAMILTON] Boo!
[linda]

 Ahh!
[HAMILTON] Hahahaha!

[Hamilton]
 Settle down, now! I have read your most recent essays. And I am amazed to report the progress!
Although, some of us still tend to favor form over content... Ms. Glinda.
[linda]

 It's GAlinda.
[Hamilton]
 Excuse me... Glinda.
[linda]

 I really don't see what the problem is. Every other professor seems to be able to pronounce my name.
[HAMILTON] Maybe pronouncing your precious name isn't the sole purpose of Doctor Dillamond's life. Maybe he's not like every other professor. Maybe some of us are different.
[linda]

 Oh! It seems the artichoke is steamed.
[Hamilton]
 Class, class! Miss Elphaba has a point! As you know, I am the sole Animal on the faculty. The token Goat, as it were. But it wasn't always this way. Oh, dear students, how I wish you could have seen it as it once was. Where you could walk down the halls and see an antelope explicating a sonnet, a snow leopard solving an equation, a wildebeast waxing philosophic. Don't you see, dear students, how our dear Ozis becoming less and less...looks at Elphaba... colorful. Now, who can tell me what sent these events into motion?
[HAMILTON] Raises hand From what I've heard, it all started with the great drought.
[Hamilton]
 Exactly. Food grew scarce, people grew hungrier and angrier. And the question became "Whom can we blame?" Can anyone tell me what is meant by the term "Scapegoat"? Elphaba Raises Hand. Someone besides Miss Elphaba? Ah yes, Miss Glinda...
[linda]

 It's GAlinda... with a GA. I don't see why you can't just teach us history instead of always harping on the past.
[Hamilton]
 Well, perhaps these questions will enlighten you... Walks Over To The Chalk Board And Turns It Over. On it is written] ANIMALS SHOULD BE SEEN AND NOT HEARD. Who is responsible for this? I'm waiting for answer... Very well, that will be all for today... You heard me, class dismissed!!!
All Students Exit Except Elphaba & Nessarose. Dillamond Has His Back Turned To Her.
[HAMILTON] You go on ahead, Nessa.
Nessarose Exits.
[HAMILTON] Reading The Board Aloud. "Animals should be seen and not heard..."
[Hamilton]
 Oh, Miss Elphaba, don't worry about me, go along and enjoy your friends.
[HAMILTON] Oh that's alright, I have no friends. Would you like to share my lunch?
[Hamilton]
 Oh, thank you! How kind.
She Pulls Out A Candy Bar And Unwraps It. He Takes The Paper and Begins To Eat It. He Sees The Board.
[Hamilton]
 I seem to have lost my appetite.
[HAMILTON] You shouldn't let statements like that bother you. I mean, I always do, but you shouldn't.
[Hamilton]
if it were only a matter of words on a chalkboard. But the things one hears these days... dreadful things! Miss Elphaba...

I'VE HEARD OF AN OX, A PROFESSOR FROM QUOX
NO LONG PERMITTED TO TEACH,
WHO HAS LOST ALL POWERS OF SPEECH.
AND AN OWL IN MUNCHKIN ROCK
A VICAR WITH A THRIVING FLOCK
FORBIDDEN TO PREACH
NOW HE ONLY CAN SCREECH!
ONLY RUMORS, BUT STILL, ENOUGH TO GIVE PAUSE
TO ANYONE WITH PAWS
SOMETHING BAD IS HAPPENING IN [Oz
[HAMILTON]
SOMETHING BAD?
HAPPENING IN [Oz?
[Hamilton]

UNDER THE SURFACE
BEHIND THE SCENES
SOMETHING BAAAAAH...
Sorry, bad...
[HAMILTON] Dr. Dillamond, are you alright? Shall I fetch you a glass of water?
[Hamilton]
 No, I don't know what came over me.
[HAMILTON] So, you're saying that there are animals that have, somehow, forgotten how to speak? But, how is that possible?
[Hamilton]
 Well, with so much pressure not to...
Morrible Enters.
[Morrible]
 I heard there was some sort of disturburance in class. Are you alright, Doctor? Oh, Miss Elphaba, you're still here! I thought you would have been on your way to my seminar by now.
[HAMILTON] Yes Madame, ordinarily I would be but...
[Morrible]
 But what? I do hope I have not misplaced my trust in you. Magic is a very demanderating mistress, and if one has ambitions of meeting the Wizard. I'm sure Doctor Dillamond sees my point.
Morrible Exits.
[HAMILTON] I'd better go. Doctor Dillamond, if something bad is happening to the Animals then someone has to tell the Wizard. That's why we have a Wizard!
SO NOTHING BAD
Both]
NOTHNG ALL THAT BAD
[Hamilton]

NOTHING TRULY BAAAAHHH...
Sorry... Bad.
[HAMILTON]
IT COULDN'T HAPPEN HERE,
IN [Oz...


[BURR]
 Here we are, sir! Shiz University!
[BURR]
 What? Already?
[BURR]
 Yes, sir.
[BURR]
 What a shame. Well, we'll see you soon, Avaric. Don't worry, I won't last longer at this school than I did at any of the others.
Avaric Exits.
[Angelica]
 Uh, miss Galinda, I know I'm just a munchkin, but munchkins have feelings too, and I've been trying to tell you mine, for you. But sometimes it seems like you don't even know I'm there.
[linda]

 That's not true, Biq.
[Angelica]
 It's LAFAYETE.
[linda]

 Biq, do you know who that is? That's Fiyero Tiggular, tha Winkie Prince whose reputation is so scandalacious!
LAFAYETE Looks Disgusted. Fiyero Walks Toward Them. Galinda Swishes Her Hair. Fiyero, Noticing Her Strange Behavior, Does The Same.
[linda]

 To Fiyero. Were you looking for something or someone?
[BURR]
 Uhhh yea... history... class? I don't know... somewhere?
[Angelica]
 History building is way over there my friend...
[linda]

 That class just ended!
[BURR]
 Oh! Perfect timing! So, uh, what does one do for fun around here?
[linda]

 Nothing really... until now...
[Angelica]
 We've been studying!
[BURR]
 Well, I see that once again the responsibility to corrupt my fellow students falls to me. Fortunately, I'm up for the task.


[BURR]

THE TROUBLE WITH SCHOOLS IS
THEY ALWAYS TRY TO TEACH THE WRONG LESSON
BELIEVE ME, I'VE BEEN KICKED OUT OF ENOUGH OF THEM TO KNOW!
THEY WANT YOU TO BECOME LESS CALLOW, LESS SHALLOW,
BUT I SAY WHY INVITE STRESS IN?
STOP STUDYING STRIFE
AND LEARN TO LIVE
THE UNEXAMINED LIFE...
DANCIN' THROUGH LIFE
SKIMMING THE SURFACE
GLIDING WHERE TURF IS SMOOTH
LIFE IS PAINLESS FOR THE BRAINLESS
THOSE WHO DON'T TRY, NEVER LOOK FOOLISH
DANCING THROUGH LIFE
NO NEED TO TOUGH IT
WHEN YOU CAN SLUFF IT OFF AS I DO
NOTHING MATTERS, BUT KNOWING NOTHING MATTERS
IT'S JUST LIFE, SO KEEP DANCING THROUGH
DANCING THROUGH LIFE
SWAYING AND SWEEPING
AND ALWAYS KEEPING COOL
LIFE IS FRAUGHTLESS
WHEN YOU'RE THOUGHTLESS
THOSE WHO DON'T TRY
NEVER LOOK FOOLISH
DANCING THROUGH LIFE
MINDLESS AND CARELESS
MAKE SURE YOU'RE WHERE LESS TROUBLE IS RIFE
WHOES ARE FLEETING
BLOWS ARE GLANCING
WHEN YOU'RE DANCING
THROUGH LIFE!
So! What's the most swankified place in town?
[linda]

 That would be the

Sounds perfect!
LET'S GO DOWN TO THE [OzDUST BALLROOM
WE'LL MEET THERE LATER TONIGHT
WE CAN DANCE 'TIL IT'S LIGHT
FIND THE PRETTIEST GIRL
GIVE HER A WHIRL!
RIGHT ON DOWN TO THE [OzDUST BALLROOM
COME ON FOLLOW ME!
YOU'LL BE HAPPY TO BE THERE
[Students]

DANCIN' THROUGH LIFE, DOWN AT THE [OzDUST (LIFE!)
[BURR]

IF ONLY BECAUSE DUST IS WHAT WE COME TO!
[Students]

NOTHIN' MATTERS, BUT KNOWING NOTHING MATTERS
IT'S JUST LIFE!!!
[BURR]

SO KEEP DANCING THROUGH...
[Angelica]
 Miss Galinda? I hope you'll save at least one dance for me. I'll be waiting right there, right by your side, waiting, all night.
[linda]

 Oh, how very kind, Biq.
[Angelica]
 ... LAFAYETE...
[linda]

 But, do you know what would be even kinder?
SEE THAT TRAGICALLY BEAUTIFUL GIRL?
THE ONE IN THE CHAIR?
IT SEEMS SO UNFAIR
WE SHOULD GO ON A SPREE
AND NOT SHE, GEE
I KNOW SOMEONE WOULD BE MY HERO
IF THAT SOMEONE WERE
TO GO INVITE HER!
[Angelica]
 Well, maybe I could invite her!
[linda]


OH, BIQ, REALLY?
YOU WOULD DO THAT FOR ME?
[Angelica]
 I would do anything for you, Miss Galinda. Walks Over To Nessarose.
Excuse me, Miss Nessarose? There's something I'd like to ask you...
[BURR]
 To Galinda. You're good.
[linda]

 I don't know what you mean. But I do happen to be free tonight, so...
[BURR]
 So, I'll be picking you up around eight?
[linda]

 After all...
NOW THAT WE'VE MET ONE ANOTHER,
Both]
IT'S CLEAR WE DESERVE EACHOTHER!
[linda]

 You're perfect!
[BURR]
 You're perfect!
[CAST]
SO WE'RE PERFECT TOGETHER
BORN TO BE FOREVER
DANCING THROUGH LIFE!!!
[HAMILTON] It's absurd! This silly, rich boy appears and everyone's off to worship him and some cultish social gathering!
[Angelica]
 Even me! I'm going! Isn't it wonderful? LAFAYETE was too shy to ask me at first, but once Galinda encouraged him...
[HAMILTON] Galinda?!
[Angelica]
 Don't you dare say another word against her! I'm about to have the first happy night of my life all thanks to Galinda!
FINALLY FOR THIS ONE NIGHT,
I'M ABOUT TO HAVE A FUN NIGHT
WITH THIS MUNCHKIN BOY GALINDA FOUND FOR ME
AND I ONLY WISH THERE WERE
SOMETHING I COULD DO FOR HER TO REPAY HER
ELPHABA SEE...
WE DESERVE EACHOTHER AND GALINDA HELPED IT COME TRUE
WE DESERVE EACHOTHER, ME AND LAFAYETE
Please, Elphaba, try to understand.
[HAMILTON] I do...
[linda]

 Now I must accessorize myself for Fiyero.
Shen Shen Pulls The Witch's Hat Out Of One Of Galinda's Hat Boxes.
Pfanee] Galinda, what in [Oz's name!?
[linda]

 Now, just pretend you didn't see that. My granny is always giving me the most hideodeous hats.
I'd give it away, but I don't hate anyone that much.
Shen Shen] Yes you do!
Pfanee] Give it to her! Just do it!
They All Stare At Elphaba. Galinda Walks Forward, Meeting Elphaba Half Way.
[HAMILTON] Galinda, listen, Nessa and I were talking about you just now...
[linda]

 And I was just talking about you! I thought you might want to wear this hat to the party tonight! Gives Her The Hat.
IT'S REALLY... UH... SHARP!
DON'T YOU THINK?
Y'KNOW BLACK, IS THIS YEAR'S PINK!
YOU DESERVE EACHOTHER,
THIS HAT AND YOU,
YOU'RE BOTH SO... SMART!
YOU DESERVE EACHOTHER, SO HERE!
OUT OF THE GOODNESS OF MY HEART!
Galinda Runs Off. Elphaba Laughs At The Sight Of The Hat. She Exits.. The Students Enter And Dance.
When This Is Done, LAFAYETE And Nessarose Appear, Awkwardly Holding Hands.
[Angelica]
 What's in the punch?
[Angelica]
 Lemons, and melons, and pears!
[Angelica]
 Oh my!
[Angelica]

LISTEN NESSA...
[Angelica]
 Yes?
[Angelica]

UH, NESSA...
I'VE GOT SOMETHING TO CONFESS A
REASON WHY, WELL, WHY I ASKED YOU HERE TONIGHT...
NOW, I KNOW IT ISN'T FAIR.
[Angelica]
 Oh, LAFAYETE, I know why.
[Angelica]
 You do?
[Angelica]

IT'S BECAUSE I'M IN THIS CHAIR, AND YOU FELT SORRY FOR ME...
WELL, ISN'T THAT RIGHT?
[Angelica]
 No... it's because... uh... because...
BECAUSE YOU ARE SO BEAUTIFUL!
[Angelica]
 Oh, LAFAYETE!
I THINK YOU'RE WONDERFUL!
AND WE DESERVE EACH OTHER, DON'T YOU SEE THIS IS OUR CHANCE?
WE DESERVE EACH OTHER, DON'T WE LAFAYETE?
[Angelica]
 You know what? Let's dance!
[Angelica]
 What?
[Angelica]

LET'S DANCE!
They Dance, As Well As The Others Around Them. Finally, Mme. Morrible Runs Up To Galinda.
[Morrible]
 Oh, Miss Upland?
[linda]

 Madame Morrible... What are you doing here?
[Morrible]
 I have something for you. She Hands Her A Small Wand.
[linda]

 Gasps. Madame... a training wand... How can I ever express my graditution?
[Morrible]
 Oh, don't thank me! This was your roommate's idea, not mine.
[linda]

 What? Elphaba?
[Morrible]
 Miss Elphaba requested that I include you in sorcery class. She insisted I tell you this very night or she would quit the seminar.
[linda]

 But... why?
[Morrible]
 I have no idea. My personal opinion is you do not have what it takes. I hope you'll prove me wrong... I doubt you will.
She Leaves. Fiyero Comes Up To Galinda.
[BURR]
 What is it?
[linda]

 I got what I wanted...
[BURR]
 Then what's the matter?
[linda]

 Nothing...
[BURR]
 Good. Let's dance...
They Begin To Dance As Elphaba Walks In. They Stop As All The Students Gasp And Make Comments About The Way She Is Dressed. People Then Start Laughing.
[BURR]
 Who in Ozis this?
[linda]

 My roommate... please, don't ... stare!
[BURR]
 How can you help it?
Elphaba Takes Off The Hat, Noticing The Comments. She Waits, Then Puts It Back On And Begins To Dance. She Is Alone. There Is No Music.
[BURR]
 Well I'll say this, she doesn't give a twig about what anyone else thinks.
[linda]

 Of course does, she just pretends not to... I feel awful...
[BURR]
 Why? It's not like it's your fault.
[linda]

 Excuse me... She Walks Over To Elphaba and Clears Her Throat. May I cut in?
Galinda Begins Dancing Just As Horribly. The Students Now Accept It, And Begin To Dance Again As The Music Starts.
All]
DANCING THROUGH LIFE, DOWN AT THE [OzDUST
IF ONLY BECAUSE DUST IS WHAT WE COME TO
AND THE STRANGE THING, YOUR LIFE COULD END UP CHANGING
WHILE YOU'RE DANCING THROUGH

[Scene 9 - Sharing Secrets]
Elphaba & Galinda Barge Into Their Suite... Galinda Is In Hysterics.
[linda]

 Your very first party ever?! Your very first party! Oh I know! Let's tell each other something we've never told anyone... I'll go first] Fiyero and I are going to be married (squeals).
[HAMILTON] Really? He's asked you already?
[linda]

 No, he doesn't know yet... Now, you tell me a secret.
[HAMILTON] Like what?
[linda]

 Like... Why do you always sleep with this funny, little, green bottle under your pillow? Grabs The Bottle.
[HAMILTON] Give that back.
[linda]

 C'mon, tell me. Tell me tell me!
[HAMILTON] It was my mother's! That's all...
Silence.
[linda]

 Hands Her The Bottle. It's not fair. I told you a really good one.
[HAMILTON] My father hates me.
[linda]

 Gasps.
[HAMILTON] No, that's not the secret. It's my fault...
[linda]

 What is?
[HAMILTON] ... that my sister is the way she is. . Pause. You see, when my mother was carrying Nessa, my father was worried that the new baby might come out...
Both] Green.
[HAMILTON] So he made my mother chew milk flowers, day and night. But that made Nessa come too soon, with her little legs all tangled. And my mother never woke up. None of which ever would have happened if not for me.
[linda]

 But that was the milkflowers fault, not yours. That may be your secret, Elphaba, but that doesn't make it true. She Oh look, it's tomorrow! Elphie... do you mind if I call you Elphie?
[HAMILTON] Well, it's a little perky.
[linda]

 And you can call me... Galinda. So... Elphie... now that we're friends, I've decided to make you my new project!
[HAMILTON] You really don't have to do that.
[linda]

 I know, that's what makes me so nice!

[linda]


WHENEVER I SEE SOMEONE LESS FORTUNATE THAN I

WHEN I SEE DEPRESSING CREATURES
WITH UNPREPOSSESSING FEATURES,
I REMIND THEM ON THEIR OWN BEHALF
TO THINK OF
CELEBRATED HEADS OF STATE
OR ESPECIALLY GREAT COMMUNICATORS
DID THEY HAVE BRAINS OR KNOWLEDGE?
DON'T MAKE ME LAUGH!
THEY WERE POPULAR
PLEASE, IT'S ALL ABOUT POPULAR
IT'S NOT ABOUT APTITUDE
IT'S THE WAY YOU'RE VIEWED
SO IT'S VERY SHREWD TO BE
VERY VERY POPULAR
LIKE ME!
[HAMILTON] This is never going to work!
[linda]

 Oh Elphie, you mustn't think that way anymore! Your whole life is going to change... and all because of me. Okay, stand... I will turn your frock into a beautiful ball gown! Stand up... She Picks Up Her Wand And Waves It. Ball gown!!! Nothing Happens, So She Repeats. Ball gown!!! Still Nothing Happens. She Taps Her Wand On The Bed. Is this thing on?
[HAMILTON] Do you want me to try?
[linda]

 No, I've got it! She Throws The Wand Down. Oh, just wear the frock... it's pretty! Now,
I'll show you how to flip your hair] Flip flip. Or you could use your hand. Demonstrates.
Or, you can use your whole body. Falls onto bed. Squeals. Now, for the finishing touch.
Takes flower out of her hair, puts it into Elphaba's. Why, Miss Elphaba, look at you, you're beautiful. Hands her the mirror.
[HAMILTON] After Looking In The Mirror. I... I have to go.
She Runs Off.
[linda]

 You're Welcome! She Admires Herself In The Mirror.
AND THOUGH YOU PROTEST
YOUR DISINTEREST,
I KNOW CLANDESTINELY...
YOU'RE GONNA GRIN AND BEAR IT
YOUR NEW FOUND POPULARITY! (SQUEALS)
LA LA LA LA
YOU'LL BE POPULAR!
JUST NOT QUITE AS POPULAR
AS ME!!!

[HAMILTON] Flips her hair.. Flip Flip! What?
[BURR]
 Nothing, it's just... you've been "Galinda-fied". You don't have to do that , you know?
[Hamilton]
 Alright, take your seats, class! I have something to say, and very little time to say it. This is my last day here at Shiz I am no longer permitted to teach. I want to thank you for your sharing your enthusiasm, your essays, no matter how feebly structured, and even, on occasion, your lunch.
Mme. Morrible Rushes In.
[Morrible]
 Doctor Dillamond! I'm so dreadfully sorry.
[HAMILTON] Madame, we've got to do something.
[Hamilton]
 Miss Elphaba, they can take away my job, but I shall continue speaking out.
Scientist] Come on, goat...
To Men Begin To Carry Him Out Of The Room.
[Hamilton]
 They are not telling you the whole story! Remember that, class! Remember that.
He Is Gone.
[HAMILTON] Doctor Dillamond! After A Pause. Well, are you just going to sit here in silence?
[Morrible]
 Miss Elphaba, there is nothing we can do. Please take your seat.
Professor] Good afternoon, students!
[Morrible]
 Good afternoon.
Professor] Every day, with every tick of the Time Dragon Clock, in every corner of our great [Oz, one hears the silence of progress. For example] this is called a cage!
He Points To A Cage With A Cloth Draped Over It. He Pulls Off The Cloth, Revealing A Lion Cub Inside.
Professor] Now, we will be seeing more and more of them in the near future. This remarkable innovation is actually for the Animal's own good...
[HAMILTON] If this is for his own good, then why is he trembling?
Professor] He's just excited to be here, that's all. Hits the cage. Now, as I was saying, one of the benefits of caging a Lion cub while he's young is that he never, in fact, will learn how to speak.
[HAMILTON] What?
He Motions The Students Forward, Toward The Cage.
Professor] That's right! Come closer!
[HAMILTON] To Fiyero. Can you imagine a world where Animals are kept in cages and they never speak?
Professor] Now, he may seem a bit agitated but that's easily remedied.
[HAMILTON] What should I do?
[BURR]
 I don't know.
[HAMILTON] Well, somebody has to... Do something!!!
Sparks Begin To Fly Everywhere. All Students & The Professor Are Moving Uncontrollably Except Fiyero and Elphaba.
[BURR]
 What's happening?
[HAMILTON] I don't know I got mad...andd
[BURR]
 Alright just don't move! And don't get mad at me... He Grabs The Cage. Well are you coming?
She Runs With Him After He Snatches The Lion Cub.
[HAMILTON] Careful! Don't shake him!
[BURR]
 I'm not!
[HAMILTON] We can't just let him loose anywhere, you know. We have to find someplace safe...
[BURR]
 Don't you think that I realize that? You must think I'm really stupid or something!
[HAMILTON] No, not really stupid.
[BURR]
 Why is it that every time I see you you're causing some sort of commotion?
[HAMILTON] I don't cause commotions, I am one.
[BURR]
 That's for sure.
[HAMILTON] Oh! So you think I should just keep my mouth shut! Is that what you're saying?
[BURR]
 No, I'm...
[HAMILTON] Do you think I want to be this way? Do you think I want to care this much? Don't you know how much easier my life would be if I didn't?
[BURR]
 Do you ever let anyone else talk?
[HAMILTON] Oh, sorry... But can I just say one more thing? You could have just walked away back there.
[BURR]
 So?
[HAMILTON] So, no matter how shallow and self-absorbed you tend to be...
[BURR]
 Excuse me, there's no pretense here. I happen to be genuinely self-absorbed and deeply shallow.
[HAMILTON] No you're not. Or you wouldn't be so unhappy.
[BURR]
 Fine, if you don't want my help...
[HAMILTON] No, I do! Poor little thing, it's heart is trembling... I didn't mean for...
[BURR]
 What did you mean to do? Why was I the only one you didn't do it to?
[HAMILTON] Oh look, you're bleeding... it must have scratched you. Referring To A Cut On His Face.
[BURR]
 Yea... or maybe it scratched me. I better get to safety... I mean the cub... get the cub to safety. He Walks Off.
[HAMILTON] Fiyero...

[[HAMILTON]
Miss Elphaba, there you are!
[HAMILTON] Madame Morrible...
[Morrible]
 Oh Miss Elphaba, I finally heard back from the Wizard!
[HAMILTON] The Wizard?
[Morrible]
 Yes, he wishes to meet you!
[HAMILTON] He asked for me?
[Morrible]
 Yes! I know how devastated you were the other day for our poor Doctor Dillamond, but I can assure you my dear, as one door closes, another one opens. She Hands Her A Green Envelope.
[HAMILTON] Madame, I don't know what to say! How can I ever thank you? She Hugs Her.
[Morrible]
 Oh careful dear, you musn't get wet She Places The Umbrella Back Over Elphaba's Head. Oh, I know! She Waves Her Hands And The Sun Comes Out. Didn't I tell you? Weather is my specialty. [Oz-speed, my dear! Make me proud.
[HAMILTON] I will, I'll try.
Morrible Exits.

[HAMILTON]
AND THERE WE'LL FINALLY BE
THE WIZARD AND I...

Conductor] All aboard!
[linda]

 Remember, eye contact. And don't forget to tell him how wonderful he is, Wizards love that! And be yourself... well... within reason.
LAFAYETE Wheels Nessarose Onstage.
[Angelica]
 Elphaba, I'm so proud of you and I know father would be too. We're all proud, aren't we?
[HAMILTON] You'll be alright, won't you?
[linda]

 She'll be fine! Biq will take care of her, right?
[Angelica]
 ...It's LAFAYETE... I... I can't do this anymore.
He Exits.
[Angelica]
 LAFAYETE...
[linda]

 Nessa, maybe he's just not the right one... for you.
[Angelica]
 No, it's me that's not right. Elphaba, just go, I'll be fine.
She Wheels Herself Offstage.
[HAMILTON] Nessa, wait!
[linda]

 Let her go. She'll have to manage without you. We all will.
[HAMILTON] Please, you'll barely even notice I'm gone. Besides, you have Fiyero. Where is he, anyway? Not that I expected him to say goodbye to me. We barely know each other.
[linda]

 I don't know him either. He's distant, and moodified, and he's been thinking, which really worrries me. I never knew how much he card about that old goat.
Fiyero Enters.
[linda]

 Oh, there he is! Fiyero, over here dearest!
[BURR]
 He Hands Elphaba Flowers. Elphaba, I'm happy for you.
[linda]

 Yes, we are both so happy...
[BURR]
 Uh, listen, I've been thinking...
[HAMILTON] Yes, I've heard.
[BURR]
 About that Lion cub and... everything. I think about that day a lot.
[HAMILTON] Really? So do I.
[linda]

 Me too! Poor Doctor Dillamond. It makes one want to... uh...
take a stand. So I've been thinking of... uh... changing my name.
[BURR]
 Your name?
[linda]

 Well, yes! Since Doctor Dillamond had his own way of pronouncing my name,
in solidarity and to express my outrage, I will henceforward be known no longer as Galinda, but as simply, Glinda.
[BURR]
 Oh well, that's very admirable of you... Glinda. To Elphaba. Elphaba, good luck.
He Runs Off.
[Burr] There, see?
[HAMILTON] Galinda...
[Burr] It's Glinda now. Stupid idea, I don't even know what made me say it.
[HAMILTON] It doesn't matter what your name is, everyone loves you!
[Burr] I don't care! I want him. I don't even think he's perfect anymore and I still want him.
This must be what other people feel like. How do they bear it? They embrace.

[HAMILTON] Come with me.
[Burr] Where?
[HAMILTON] To the Emerald City.
[Burr] Really?
[Ozia]

ONE SHORT DAY, IN THE EMERALD CITY...

[Burr] All the hustle and bustle! It's all so [Ozmopolitan! Elphie... Elphie? C'mon we'll be late for WizOMania.
[HAMILTON] I want to remember this moment, always. Nobody's pointing, nobody's staring, for the first time, I'm somewhere that I belong.
[Burr] You look positively, emerald.

[Hamilton]
I am [Oz, the great and terrible! Who are you and why do you seek me?
[Burr] Say something!
[HAMILTON] Uh... Elphaba Thropp your terribleness!
His Speaks Normally.
[Hamilton]
Oh? Is that you Elphaba? I didn't realize!
He Climbs Out Of The Head.
[Hamilton]
I hope I didn't startle you, it's so hard to make out peoples' faces all the way back there.
So, let's see... which is which? Elphaba! He grabs her hands. And you must be.
[Burr] Glinda. The Ga is silent.
Elphaba touches the Ozmask.
[Hamilton]
I know. It isn't much, is it? But people expect this sort of thing. You have to give people what they want.
The thing is, I hardly ever let people meet the real me, but this being special occasion.
[HAMILTON] I'm so happy to meet you.
[Hamilton]
Well, that's good. 'Cause that's what I love best] making people happy!
I AM A SENTIMENTAL MAN
WHO ALWAYS LONGED TO BE A FATHER
THAT'S WHY I DO THE BEST I CAN
TO TREAT EACH CITIZEN OF OzAS SON
OR DAUGHTER
SO ELPHABA I'D LIKE TO RAISE YOU HIGH
'CUZ I THINK EVERYONE DESERVES THE CHANCE TO FLY!
AND HELPING YOU WITH YOUR ASCENT
ALLOWS ME TO FEEL SO PARENTAL.
FOR I AM
A SENTIMENTAL MAN!
[HAMILTON] I'm here... we're here to alert you that something bad is happening...
[Hamilton]
Please, I'm the Wizard of [Oz. I already know why you've come.
Elphaba & [Burr] Oooo.
[Hamilton]
Of course, you must prove yourself...
[Burr] Prove yourself, prove yourself.
[HAMILTON] But how?
[Hamilton]
Oh, I don't know.
SOME SORT OF GESTURE
MOSTLY FOR SHOW
SOMETHING TO TEST YOUR ADEPTNESS..
I know! Madame, the book!
Morrible Enters.
[Burr] Madame Morrible...
[Hamilton]
I believe you're well acquainted with my new Press Secretary.
[HAMILTON] Press Secretary?
[Morrible]
 Oh, yes dearies, I've risen up in the world. You'll find that the Wizard is a very generous man.
If you do something for him, he'll do much for you.
[HAMILTON] What do yhou want me to do?
[Hamilton]
Well, this is my monkey servent, Chistery. He looks so longingly at the birds every morning....
[Morrible]
 So the Wizard was thinking, perhaps, a levitation spell...
[Burr] Noticing A Book In Morrible's Hands. Is that the Grimmerie?
[Morrible]
 Yes, the ancient book of spells and enchantments. Hands It To Elphaba.
[Burr] Whispers. Can I touch it?
Morrlbe] Whispers. No!
[HAMILTON] What funny writing...
[Morrible]
 Well it's a lost language. The lost language of spells.
[Hamilton]
It's kind of a recipe book for change.
[Morrible]
 Don't be discouraged if you can't decipherate it, dearie.
I, myself, can only read a spell or two, and that took years and years
[HAMILTON]
AHVEN, TATEY, AVEN TATEY AVEN...

[HAMILTON] What happened? Is something wrong?
[Morrible]
 No just a transition, dearie.
[HAMILTON] No, stop you're hurting him!
[Hamilton]
She's actually done it!
Chistery Sprouts Wings. And Begins Running Around The Stage.
[HAMILTON] NO! Quick, how do I reverse it?
[Morrible]
 You can't!
[HAMILTON] What?!
[Morrible]
 You can't! Spells are irreversible! I knew she had the power, I told you!
[HAMILTON] You planned all this?
[Morrible]
 Well, you benefit too, dearie! You benefit, too.
[Hamilton]
And this is only the beginning! Look.
The Other Monkeys Begin To Grow Wings And Fly.
[Morrible]
 Won't they make perfect spies?
[HAMILTON] Spies?!
[Hamilton]
You're right, that's a harsh word... how about scouts? That's what they'll be really. They'll fly around [Oz! Report any subversive Animal activity.
[HAMILTON] You can't read this book at all! Can you? That's why you need enemies, and cages, and spies. You have no real power.
[Hamilton]
Exactly... that's why I need you. Don't you see? The world is your oyster, now! You have so many...opportunites. You both do.
[Burr] Thank you, your [Ozness.
Wizard]
SINCE ONCE I HAD MY OWN DAY IN THE SKY
I KNOW EVERYONE DESERVES THE CHANCE TO...
[HAMILTON] NO!
She Runs Off.
[Morrible]
 Elphaba!
[Burr] Elphie! I am so sorry, your Wizardship. I'll fetch her back! Elphie wait!
She Runs After Her.
[Hamilton]
We must get her back. She knows too much.
[Morrible]
 Don't worry! I will handle it.
He Gets Back In The Head. Speaking, Again, With A Powerful Voice.
[Hamilton]
Guards, guards! There is a fugitive loose in the palace! Find her, capture her, and bring her to me!
Guards] Yes your [Ozness!

[Burr] Elphie, wait! Where are you going?
[HAMILTON] Oh no! There are no more stairs! This might be the attic...
[Burr] Elphaba, listen to me...
[HAMILTON] I have to barricade the door! She Picks Up A Broom And Places It Over A Trap Door.
[Burr] Elphaba, why couldn't you have stayed calm for once instead of flying off the handle?
I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY
I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY NOW
I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY HOW YOU'VE HURT YOUR CAUSE FOREVER
I HOPE YOU THINK YOU'RE CLEVER
[HAMILTON]
I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY! I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY TOO
I HOPE YOU'RE PROUD HOW YOU WOULD GROVEL IN SUBMISSION
TO FEED YOUR OWN AMBISSION
Both]
SO THOUGH I CAN'T IMAGINE HOW
I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY
RIGHT NOW...
[Morrible]
 Citizens of [Oz, there is an enemy that must be found and captured! Believe nothing she says. She's evil. Responsible for the mutilation of these poor, innocent monkeys! Her green skin is but an outward manifestation of her twisted nature! This distortion... this repulsion... this... Wicked Witch!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[Burr] Don't be afraid...
[HAMILTON] I'm not... it's the Wizard who should be afraid... of me!
[Burr] Elphie, just say you're sorry before it's too late.
YOU CAN STILL BE WITH THE WIZARD
WHAT YOU'VE WORKED AND WAITED FOR
YOU CAN HAVE ALL YOU EVER WANTED...
[HAMILTON] I know...
BUT I DON'T WANT IT
NO, I CAN'T WANT IT
ANYMORE...
SOMETHING HAS CHANGED WITHIN ME
SOMETHING IS NOT THE SAME
I'M THROUGH WITH PLAYING BY THE RULES
OF SOMEONE ELSE'S GAME!
TOO LATE FOR SECOND GUESSING
TOO LATE TO GO BACK TO SLEEP
IT'S TIME TO TRUST MY INSTINCTS
CLOSE MY EYES...
AND LEAP
IT'S TIME TO TRY DEFYING GRAVITY
I THINK I'LL TRY DEFYING GRAVITY
AND YOU CAN'T PULL ME DOWN
[Burr]
CAN'T I MAKE YOU UNDERSTAND
YOU'RE HAVING DELUSIONS OF GRANDURE?
[HAMILTON]
I'M THROUHG EXCEPTING LIMITS
'CUZ SOMEONE SAYS THEY'RE SO
SOME THINGS I CANNOT CHANGE,
BUT 'TIL I TRY I'LL NEVER KNOW!
TOO LONG I'VE BEEN AFRAID OF
LOSING LOVE I GUESS I'D LOST
WELL IF THAT'S LOVE,
IT COMES AT MUCH TOO HIGH A COST!
I'D SOONER BUY DEFYING GRAVITY
KISS ME GOODBYE I'M DEFYING GRAVITY
AND YOU CAN'T PULL ME DOWN!
The Guards Bang On The Locked Door.
[Guard]
 Open this door, in the name of his supreme [Ozness!
[HAMILTON] Ah May Ah Tay Ah Tum Ditum...
[Burr]
That's what started all this in the first place... that hideous levitation spell! STOP!!!
[Burr] Well... Where are your wings? Maybe you're not as powerful as you think you are...
A Broomstick Floats Across The Room Towards Elphaba.
[HAMILTON] I told you, Glinda... I did it, I tell ya!
The Guards Bang On The Door Once Again.
[HAMILTON] Quick! Get on!
[Burr] What?
[HAMILTON] Come with me... think of what we could do... together.
UNLIMITED, TOGETHER WE'RE UNLIMITED
TOGETHER WE'LL BE THE GREATEST TEAM THERE'S EVER BEEN, GLINDA
DREAMS THE WAY WE PLANNED 'EM
[Burr]
IF WE WORK IN TANDEM
Both]
JUST YOU AND I DEFYING GRAVITY
WITH YOU AND I DEFYING GRAVITY
[HAMILTON]
THEY'LL NEVER BRING US DOWN.
Well, are you coming?
[Burr] Elphie, you're trembling... here, put this around you...
She Drapes A Black Cape Around Her.
I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY
NOW THAT YOU'RE CHOOSING THIS
[HAMILTON] You too.
I HOPE IT BRINGS YOU BLISS
Both]
I REALLY HOPE YOU GET IT
AND YOU DON'T LIVE TO REGRET IT
I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY IN THE END!
I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY...
MY FRIEND...
Elphaba Runs Off. The Guards Break Down The Door.
[Guard]
 There she is! Don't let her get away!
They Grab Hold Of Glinda.
[Burr]
What in [Oz?! Let go of me! Do you hear me? Let go!
[HAMILTON]
It's not her. She has nothing to do with. I'm the one you want. It's me. Hahahahaha. It's me! Up here! It's me!
She Rises Up Center Stage Holding Her Broom.
[HAMILTON]
SO IF YOU CARE TO FIND ME,
LOOK TO THE WESTERN SKY
AS SOMEONE TOLD ME LATELY,
EVERYONE DESERVES THE CHANCE TO FLY!
AND IF I'M FLYING SOLO,
AT LEAST I'M FLYING FREE!
TO THOSE WHO GROUND ME,
TAKE A MESSAGE BACK FROM ME!
TELL THEM HOW I AM DEFYING GRAVITY!!!
I'M FLYING HIGH DEFYING GRAVITY!!!
AND SOON I'LL MATCH THEM IN RENOWN
AND NOBODY
IN ALL OF [Oz...
NO WIZARD THAT THERE IS OR WAS
IS EVER GONNA BRING
ME DOWN!!!

[Ozians

ACT II


The Act Opens With [Ozians.

[Ozia]

EVERY DAY THE WICKED
EVERY DAY THE TERROR GROWS
ALL OF OzIS EVER ON ALERT
THAT'S THE WAY WITH WICKED-
SPREADING FEAR WHERE E'ER SHE GOES
SEEKING OUT NEW VICTIMS SHE CAN HURT!
[Ozian Woman]
LIKE SOME TERRIBLE GREEN BLIZZARD
THROUGHOUT THE LAND SHE FLIES...
[Ozian Man]
DEFAMING OUR POOR WIZARD
[Ozia]

WITH HER CALUMNIES AND LIES
SHE LIES!
SAVE US FROM THE WICKED
SHIELD US SO WE WON'T BE HEXED
GIVE US WARNING
WHERE WILL SHE STRIKE NEXT
WHERE WILL SHE STRIKE NEXT
WHERE WILL SHE STRIKE NEXT
Glinda, Fiyero and Morrible Appear Onstage On APodium.
[Burr] Fellow [Ozians, as terrifying as terror is, let us put aside our panic for this one day... and celebrate!
OH WHAT A CELEBRATION WE'LL HAVE TODAY!
[Ozia]

THANK GOODNESS!
[Burr]
LET'S HAVE A CELEBRATION THE GLINDA WAY!
[Ozia]

THANK GOODNESS!
[Morrible]

FINALLY A DAY THAT'S TOTALLY WICKED WITCH FREE
All]
WE COULDN'T BE HAPPIER
THANK GOODNESS!
[Morrible]
 And thank goodness for you, Glinda, and your handsome swain, our new captain of the guard.
To Fiyero. Now you've been at the forefront of the hunt for the Wicked Witch, haven't you?
[BURR]
 Not really, but I don't like to think of her as a Wicked Witch.
[Morrible]
 Captain, how does it feel?
[BURR]
 Frustrating... but I became captain of the guard to find her, and I will keep searching!
[Morrible]
 No, being engaged!
[Ozia]
 Congratulotions!
[BURR]
 To Glinda - Confused. This is an engagement party?
[Burr] Surprised?
[BURR]
 Yes!
[Burr] Good, we hoped you'd be... the Wizard and I!
WE COULDN'T BE HAPPIER
RIGHT DEAR?
COULDN'T BE HAPPIER
RIGHT HERE
LOOK WHAT WE'VE GOT
A FAIRY TALE PLOT
OUR VERY OWN HAPPY ENDING
WHERE WE COULDN'T BE HAPPIER
TRUE DEAR?
COULDN'T BE HAPPIER
AND WE'RE HAPPY TO SHARE OUR ENDING VICARIOUSLY
WITH ALL OF YOU!
HE COULDN'T LOOK HANDSOMER
I COULDN'T BE HUMBLER
BECAUSE HAPPY IS WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN ALL YOUR DREAMS COME TRUE...
[Morrible]
 And Glinda, dear, we're happy for you! As Press Secretary,
I have striven to ensure that all of Ozknows the story of your braverism! How I vividly remember...
THE DAY YOU WERE FIRST SUMMONED
TO AN AUDIENCE WITH [Oz,
AND ALTHOUGH HE WOULD NOT TELL YOU WHY INITIALLY
WHEN YOU BOWED BEFORE HIS THROWN
HE DECREED YOU'D HENCE BE KNOWN
AS GLINDA THE GOOD
OFFICIALLY!
[BURR]
 That's not how you described it to me.
[Burr] Oh no, not exactly, but Whispers we'll talk about it later.
[Morrible]

THEN WITH A JEALOUS SQUEEE
THE WICKED WITCH BURST FROM CONCEALMENT
WHERE SHE HAD BEEN LURKING
SURREPTITIALLY!
Gasps From Among The Crowd.
[Ozian]
I HEAR SHE HAS AN EXTRA EYE THAT ALWAYS REMAINS AWAKE!
[Ozian]
I HEAR THAT SHE CAN SHED HER SKIN AS EASILY AS A SNAKE!
[Ozian]
I HEAR SOME REBEL ANIMALS ARE GIVING HER FOOD AND SHELTER!
[Ozian]
I HEAR HER SOUL IS SO UNCLEAN, PURE WATER CAN MELT HER!
[BURR]
 What?
[Ozia]

MELT HER! PLEASE SOMEBODY GO AND MELT HER!
[BURR]
 Do you hear that?! Water will melt her? People are so empty-headed they'll believe anything!
[Burr] Excuse me just a tick-tock!
Her And Fiyero Talk Aside.
[BURR]
 I can't just stand here grinning pretending to go along with all of this!
[Burr] Do you think I like to hear them say those awful things about her? I hate it!
[BURR]
 Then what are we doing here? Let's go, let's get out of here!
[Burr] We can't leave now, not when people are looking to us to raise their spirits.
[BURR]
 You can't leave, because you can't resist this. And that is the truth.
[Burr] Maybe I can't. Is that so wrong? Who could?
[BURR]
 You know who could. Who has.
[Burr] Fiyero, I miss her too, but we can't just stop living. No one has searched harder for her than you. But don't you see? She doesn't want to be found. We have to face it.
[BURR]
 You're right. I'm sorry, you're right. And if it's going tol make you happy, of course I'll marry you.
[Burr] But it'll make you happy too, right?
[BURR]
 You know me... I'm always happy. He Runs Off.
[Burr] Fiyero! Thanks plenty dearest! He's gone to fetch me a refreshment, he's so thoughtful that way!
THAT'S WHY I COULDN'T BE HAPPIER
NO, I COULDN'T BE HAPPIER
THOUGH IT IS I ADMIT, THE TINIEST BIT
UNLIKE I ANTICIPATED,
BUT I COULDN'T BE HAPPIER
SIMPLY COULDN'T BE HAPPIER...
Well, not simply...
'CUZ GETTING YOUR DREAMS, IT'S STRANGE BUT IT SEEMS
A LITTLE, WELL, COMPLICATED...
THERE'S A KIND OF A SORT OF COST
THERE'S A COUPLE OF THINGS GET LOST...
THERE ARE BRIDGES YOU CROSSED YOU DIDN'T KNOW YOU CROSSED UNTIL YOU'VE CROSSED!
AND IF THAT JOY THAT THRILL
DOESN'T THRILL LIKE YOU THINK IT WILL...
STILL... WITH THIS PERFECT FINALE
THE CHEERS AND THE BALLYHOO
WHO WOULDN'T BE HAPPIER?
SO I COULDN'T BE HAPPIER
BECAUSE HAPPY IS WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN ALL YOUR DREAMS COME TRUE...
WELL, ISN'T IT?
HAPPY IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOUR DREAMS COME...
TRUE!!!!
[Ozia]

WE LOVE YOU GLINDA IF WE MAY BE SO FRANK!
[Burr]
THANK GOODNESS!
[Ozia]

FOR ALL THIS JOY WE KNOW WHO WE'VE GOT TO THANK!
THANK GOODNESS!
THAT MEANS THE WIZARD, GLINDA...
[Burr]
AND FIANCE!
[Ozia]

[Ozia]
 THANK GOODNESS!!!
[Burr] TODAY!!!!
[Ozia]
 TODAY, THANK GOODNESS FOR TODAY!


[Angelica]
 Will there be anything else, Madame?
[Angelica]
 I've asked you to call me Nessarose, remember?
[Angelica]
 Yes, Madame. He Exits.
[Angelica]
 LAFAYETE...
Elphaba's Voice Is Heard Inside A Closet.
[HAMILTON] Well, it seems the beautiful only get more beautiful, Nessarose Screams while the green just get greener.
Nessarose Is Scared And Confused.
Elphaba Steps Out Of The Closet.
[HAMILTON] I'm sorry. Did I scare you? I seem to have that effect on people. It's good to see you.
[Angelica]
 What are you doing here?
[HAMILTON] Well, there's no place like home. I never thought I'd hear myself say this but I need father's help. I need him to stand with me.
[Angelica]
 That's impossible.
[HAMILTON] No, no it's not. Not if you ask him. You know he'll listen to you.
[Angelica]
 Father's dead.
[HAMILTON] What?
[Angelica]
 He's dead. I'm the governor... Well what did you expect? After he learned what you'd done,
how you'd disgraced u,s he died... of shame. Embarrassed to death.
[HAMILTON] Good, I'm glad. It's better that way.
[Angelica]
 That's a wicked thing to say.
[HAMILTON] No, it's true. Because now it's just us. You can help me and together we can...
[Angelica]
 Elphaba, shut up! First of all, I can't harbor a fugitive, I'm an un-elected official!
And why should I help you? You fly around [Oz, trying to rescue animals you've never even met,
and not once have you ever thought to use your powers to rescue me!
ALL OF MY LIFE, I'VE DEPENDED ON YOU
HOW DO YOU THINK THAT FEELS?
ALL OF MY LIFE I'VE DEPENDED ON YOU
AND THIS HIDEOUS CHAIR WITH WHEELS!
SCROUNGING FOR SCRAPS OF PITY TO PICK UP
AND LONGING TO KICK UP
MY HEELS...
[HAMILTON] Nessa, there isn't a spell for everything! The power is mysterious.
It's not like coddling up a pair of... She Pulls Out The Grimmerie From Her Bag. Wait.
[Angelica]
 What are you doing?
Elphaba Begins Chanting.
[Angelica]
 What is that? Ah! My shoes! It feels like... like they're on fire! What have you done to my shoes???
She Lifts Her Dress, Revealing The Ruby Slippers. Nessarose Stands, But Falls. Elphaba Gives Her A Hand.
[Angelica]
 No, don't help me. She Stands.
[HAMILTON] Oh, Nessa, at last...
I'VE DONE WHAT LONG AGO I SHOULD
AND FINALLY FROM THESE POWERS SOMETHING GOOD
FINALLY SOMETHING GOOD...
[Angelica]
 LAFAYETE! LAFAYETE! Come quickly!
[HAMILTON] LAFAYETE?
[Angelica]
 LAFAYETE! Come here at once!
[HAMILTON] No! Nessa, listen, nobody can know I'm here!
Nessarose Runs Behind The Closet As LAFAYETE Enters.
[Angelica]
 Yes, what is it, Madame?
[HAMILTON] LAFAYETE...
[Angelica]
 What are you doing here? You stay back!
[HAMILTON] LAFAYETE, it's just me, I'm not going to hurt you!
[Angelica]
 No! You're lying! That's all you ever do! You and your sister! She's as wicked as you are!
[HAMILTON] What are you talking about?
[Angelica]
 I'm talking about my life. The little that's left of it. I'm not free to leave Munchkinland, none of us are.
Ever since she took power, she's been stripping the Munchkins of our rights...
and we didn't have that many to begin with! And do you know why?
Nessarose Reveals Herself In The Chair.
[Angelica]
 To keep you here, with me. But none of that matters anymore. Look.
Nessarose Stands Up.
[Angelica]
 To Elphaba. You did this for her?
[Angelica]
 For both of us!
[Angelica]
 Nessa, this changes everything.
[Angelica]
 I know.
[Angelica]

LISTEN NESSA...
[Angelica]
 What?
[Angelica]

UH NESSA, SURELY NOW I'LL MATTER LESS TO YOU
AND YOU WON'T MIND MY LEAVING HERE TONIGHT...
[Angelica]
 Leaving?
[Angelica]
 Yes...
THAT BALL THAT'S BEING STAGED
ANNOUNCING GLINDA IS ENGAGED
[Angelica]
 Glinda?
[Angelica]

YES NESSA THAT'S RIGHT!
I'VE GOT TO GO APPEAL TO HER
EXPRESS THE WAY I FEEL TO HER
Oh, Nessa, I lost my heart to Glinda from the moment I first saw her. You know that.
[Angelica]
 Lost your heart? Well, we'll see about that...
[HAMILTON] Nessa, let him go...
[Angelica]

DID YOU THINK I'D LET YOU LEAVE ME HERE FLAT?
[Angelica]
 Don't come any closer!
YOU'RE GOING TO LOSE YOUR HEART TO ME, I TELL YOU!
IF I HAVE TO... I HAVE TO...
Sees The Grimmerie.
MAGIC SPELL YOU...
She Grabs The Book.
[Angelica]
 Ah... Tum... Tah... Tae...
Elphaba Reveals Herself.
[HAMILTON] Nessa, stop!
[Angelica]
 What is she doing?!
[HAMILTON] No, Nessa, you're pronouncing the words all wrong!
[HAMILTON] Nessa!
[Angelica]
 LAFAYETE! What is it?
[Angelica]
 Gasps. My heart feels like it's... shrinking.
[Angelica]
 Elphaba, do something!
[HAMILTON] I can't! You can't reverse a spell once it's been cast!
[Angelica]
 So what do we do?
LAFAYETE Falls Into Nessa's Empty Wheel Chair. Elphaba Wheels Him Behind The Closet.
[Angelica]
 Elphaba, do something!
[Angelica]
 This is all your fault! If you hadn't shown me that horrendible book.
[HAMILTON] I have to find another spell... it's the only thing that might work. She Goes Behind The Closet As Well.
[Angelica]
 Save him, please!
JUST SAVE HIM, MY POOR LAFAYETE, MY SWEET MY BRAVE,
DON'T LEAVE ME 'TIL MY SORRY LIFE HAS CEASED...
Elphaba Wheels The Chair Out, Which Is Not Facing The Audience And Is Seen Casting A Spell.
ALL ALONE AND LOVELESS HERE
JUST THE GIRL IN THE MIRROR
JUST HER AND ME! THE WICKED WITCH OF THE EAST!
WE DESERVE EACH OTHER...
[Angelica]
 Well... what about his heart?
[HAMILTON] It's all right. He won't need one now. I have to go. I have business to attend to in the Emerald City.
Nessa, I have done everything I could for you but it has never been enough and it never will be...
She Leaves.
[Angelica]
 Elphaba, wait! Elphaba!
LAFAYETE Wakes Up.
[Angelica]
 Where am I? What happened?
[Angelica]
 Nothing, LAFAYETE, you just fell asleep... and...
He Sits Up, Squeaking. He Is Made Of Tin. Nessarose Screams.
[Angelica]
 What is it, what's wrong?
[Angelica]
 No, it wasn't me it was her! I tried to stop her.
LAFAYETE Screams Uncontrollably And Runs Off.
[Angelica]
 LAFAYETE, please listen! It was Elphaba! LAFAYETE! It was Elphaba!!!

[Hamilton]
[HAMILTON] Well you have, you have harmed me.
[Hamilton]
I realize that, and I regret it. Elphaba...
[HAMILTON] There you are! I'm setting those monkeys free! And don't try to interfere, or call the guards...
[Hamilton]
I'm not calling anyone. The truth is I'm glad to see you again. It gets pretty lonely around here. And I know you must get lonely too.
[HAMILTON] You don't know the first thing about me.
[Hamilton]
Oh, but I do. I do know you. I can't explain it exactly. You know what I mean? Elphaba, you've been so strong through all of this, aren't you tired of being the strong one? Wouldn't you like someone to take care of you? He Hands Her Back The Broom. Please, help me start again.
[HAMILTON] Don't you think I wish I could? That I could go back to the time when I believed you really were wonderful? The Wonderful Wizard of [Oz? Nobody believed in you more than I did.
[Hamilton]
Oh, my dear child...
I NEVER ASKED FOR THIS OR PLANNED IT IN ADVANCE
I WAS MERELY BLOWN HERE BY THE WINDS OF CHANCE
I NEVER SAW MYSELF AS A SOLOMON OR SOCRATES
I KNEW WHO I WAS, ONE OF YOUR DIME A D[OzEN MEDIOCRATES
THEN SUDDENLY I'M HERE, RESPECTED, WORSHIPED EVEN
JUST BECAUSE THE FOLKS IN OzNEEDED SOMEONE TO BELIEVE IN
DOES IT SURPRISE YOU I GOT HOOKED AND ALL TOO SOON
WHAT CAN I SAY? I GOT CARRIED AWAY
AND NOT JUST BY BALLOON...
WONDERFUL
THEY CALLED ME WONDERFUL
SO I SAID, WONDERFUL, IF YOU INSIST
I WILL BE WONDERFUL
AND THEY SAID WONDERFUL
BELIEVE ME IT'S HARD TO RESIST
'CUZ IT FEELS WONDERFUL
THEY THINK I'M WONDERFUL
HEY LOOK WHO'S WONDERFUL
THIS CORN-FED HICK!
WHO SAID IT MIGHT BE KEEN
TO BUILD A TOWN OF GREEN
AND A WONDERFUL ROAD OF YELLOW BRICK!
See, I never had a family of my own since I was always traveling, and I guess I just wanted to give the citizens of Ozeverything.
[HAMILTON] So you lied to them?
[Hamilton]
Only verbally. Besides, they were the lies they wanted to hear. Elphaba, where I come from we believe all sorts of things that aren't true... we call it history!
A MAN'S CALLED A TRAITOR
OR LIBERATOR
A RICH MAN'S A THIEF
OR PHILANTHROPIST
IS ONE A CRUSADER
OR RUTHLESS INVADER
IT'S ALL IN THE LABEL WHICH IS ABLE TO PERSIST
THERE ARE PRECIOUS FEW AT EASE
WITH MORAL AMBIGUITIES
SO WE ACT AS THOUGH THEY DON'T EXIST...
THEY CALL ME WONDERFUL
SO I AM
INFACT, IT'S SO MUCH WHO I AM IT'S PART OF MY NAME!
AND WITH MY HELP YOU CAN BE THE SAME...
AT LONG, LONG LAST RECEIVE YOUR DUE
LONG OVERDUE
ELPHABA, THE MOST CELEBRATED
ARE THE REHABILITATED
THERE'LL SUCH A WHOOPDEE DOO!
A CELEBRATION THROUGHOUT [Oz,
THAT'S ALL TO DO WITH YOU!
WONDERFUL, THEY'LL CALL YOU WONDERFUL!
[HAMILTON]
THAT DOES SOUND WONDERFUL!
Wizard]
TRUST ME IT'S FUN!!!
Both]
WHEN YOU ARE WONDERFUL,
IT WOULD BE WONDERFUL!
WONDERFUL, WONDERFUL
Wizard]
ONE, TWO AND...
They Dance.
[HAMILTON]
I'LL ACCEPT YOUR PROPOSITION
[Hamilton]
Wonderful
[HAMILTON]
ON ONE CONDITION
[Hamilton]
Yes?
[HAMILTON] You set those Monkeys free.
[Hamilton]
Done.

[HAMILTON] Go! Fly! You're Free! Fly! Chistery, Chistery, you're free, isn't it wonderful?! Go, fly! She Makes Her Way To Another "Monkey" Covered By A Sheet.
[Hamilton]
No! No! Please!
She Pulls Off The Cover, Revealing Dr. Dillamond.
[HAMILTON] No! It can't be! Doctor Dillamond...
[Hamilton]
Elphaba, we just couldn't keep letting him speak out...
[HAMILTON] Doctor Dillamond, are you alright? Don't be afraid. It's me, Elphaba.
[Hamilton]
 Bahhhhh.
[HAMILTON] Doctor, don't you remember me?
[Hamilton]
 Bahhhhh.
[HAMILTON] Can't you speak?
[Hamilton]
 Bahhhhh.
[HAMILTON] No... We have nothing in common. I am nothing like you and I never will be and I will fight you until the day I die!!!
The Wizard Climbs Into The Head And Dr. Dillamond Runs Offstage.

[Hamilton]
Guards, guards!!!
Fiyero Runs In With His Men.
[Guard]
 Halt!
[BURR]
 Are you alright, your [Ozness?
[HAMILTON] Fiyero!
[BURR]
 I don't believe it...
[HAMILTON] Oh , Fiyero, thank God. I thought you were...
[BURR]
 Silence witch!!!
[Guard]
 There's a Goat on the lam, sir.
[BURR]
 Never mind all that. Fetch me some... some water.
[Guard]
 Water, sir?
[BURR]
 You heard me, as much as you can carry.
Guards] Yes, sir!
They March Off.
[HAMILTON] Fiyero...
[BURR]
 I said silence!
[Hamilton]
He Runs Out Of The Head. No! No!
[BURR]
 Don't make a sound, your [Ozness, unless you want all your guests to know the truth about the Wonderful Wizard of [Oz... Elphaba, I'll find Doctor Dillamond later, no get out of here.
[HAMILTON] Fiyero, you frightened me. I thought, I though you might have changed.
[BURR]
 I have... changed.
Glinda Enters.
[Burr] What's going on... Elphie? Oh, thank Ozyou're alive! Only you shouldn't have come. If anyone discoverates you ...
[BURR]
 Glinda, you'd better go.
[Burr] Fiyero, what are you...
[BURR]
 Please, just go back to the ball.
[Burr] Your [Ozness, he means no disrespectation. Please understand! You see, we all went to school together...
[BURR]
 Elphaba!
[Burr] Fiyero, have you misplaced your mind? What are you doing?
[BURR]
 I'm going with her.
[Burr] What? What are you saying? You mean all this time... the two of you... behind my back...
[HAMILTON] No, Glinda it wasn't like that!
[BURR]
 Actually, it was...but it wasn't...Elphaba, let's go... let's go!
They Run Off.
[Burr] Fine, go! You deserve each other...
The Wizard Holds A Small Bottle With A Green Liquid.
[Hamilton]
Here, have a swig of this, it dulls the pain.
[Burr] No, thank you.
Mme. Morrible Enters, Laughing.
[Morrible]
 Oh, is it true? Your betrothed has taken her into custody?
[Hamilton]
Our new captain of the guard had other plans.
[Morrible]
 You mean she hasn't been captured?
[Hamilton]
Quite the contrary. And considering how well she eluded us last time...
[Morrible]
 Well, we'll just flush her out and force her to show herself.
[Hamilton]
But how?
[Burr] Her sister
[Morrible]
 What? What did she say?
[Burr] Use her sister. Spread a rumor. Make her think her sister is in trouble and she will fly to her side... and you'll have her.
[Hamilton]
Exactly so.
[Burr] Now, if your [Ozness will excuse me I have a slight headache, I think I'll lie down.
She Walks Out.
[Morrible]
 Yes, well...a rumor won't do it. Elphaba's too smart for that.
[Hamilton]
Far too smart.
[Morrible]
 Perhaps, a change in the weather...

[Burr]
DON'T WISH, DON'T START
WISHING ONLY WOUNDS THE HEART...
THERE'S A GIRL I KNOW, HE LOVES HER SO...
I'M NOT THAT GIRL...

Only Elphaba & Fiyero Are On Stage, In The Woods
[HAMILTON]
KISS ME TOO FIERCELY, HOLD ME TOO TIGHT
I NEED HELP BELIEVING YOU'RE WITH ME TONIGHT
MY WILDEST DREAMINGS COULD NOT FORSEE
LYING BESIDE YOU WITH YOU WANTING ME
IF JUST FOR THIS MOMENT
AS LONG AS YOU'RE MINE
I'VE LOST ALL RESISTANCE
AND CROSSED SOME BORDERLINE
AND IF IT TURNS OUT
IT'S OVER TOO FAST
I'LL MAKE EVERY LAST MOMENT LAST
AS LONG AS YOU'RE MINE...
[BURR]

MAYBE I'M BRAINLESS, MAYBE I'M WISE,
BUT YOU'VE GOT ME SEEING THROUGH DIFFERENT EYES,
SOMEHOW I'VE FALLEN UNDER YOUR SPELL
AND SOMEHOW I'M FEELING
IT'S UP THAT I FELL
Both]
EVERY MOMENT, AS LONG AS YOU'RE MINE
I'LL WAKE UP MY BODY
AND MAKE UP FOR LOST TIME
[BURR]

SAY THERE'S NO FUTURE
FOR US AS A PAIR...
Both]
AND THOUGH I MAY KNOW,
I DON'T CARE
IF JUST FOR THIS MOMENT
AS LONG AS YOU'RE MINE
COME BE HOW YOU WANT TO
AND SEE HOW BRIGHT WE SHINE!
BORROW THE MOONLIGHT
UNTIL IT IS THROUGH
AND KNOW I'LL BE HERE HOLDING YOU...
AS LONG AS YOU'RE MINE...
[BURR]
 What is it?
[HAMILTON] It's just... for the first time... I feel... wicked.

[HAMILTON] I just wish...
[BURR]
 What?
[HAMILTON] I wish I could be beautiful... for you.
[BURR]
 Elphaba...
[HAMILTON] Don't tell me that I am, you don't need to lie to me.
[BURR]
 It's not lying! It's... uh... it's looking at things another way. Someday, you and Glinda will make up and we'll all...
[HAMILTON] Shh! Listen... Do you hear that? A Shriek Is Heard In The Distance. It sounds like somebody in pain.
[BURR]
 It's just the wind.
[HAMILTON] The Siren Is Heard Again. My sister's in danger.
[BURR]
 What? How do you know?
[HAMILTON] I don't know, I just do... Gasps.
[BURR]
 Elphaba what's wrong, what is it?
[HAMILTON] This! Don't you see it?
[BURR]
 What do you mean? What do you see?
[HAMILTON] It doesn't make any sense... It's a house but it's... it's flying through the sky? I have to go to Nessa!
[BURR]
 I'll come with you!
[HAMILTON] No, you mustn't, it's too dangerous!
[BURR]
 Listen to me, listen! My family has a castle in Kiamo Ko. Now, no one is ever there except for the sentries who watch over it. We've never lived there.
[HAMILTON] Where do you live?
[BURR]
 In the other castle... It's the perfect hiding place; tunnels, secret passageways. You'll be safe there.
[HAMILTON] We will see each other again, won't we?
[BURR]
 Elphaba, we are going to be together always. You can see houses flying through the sky, can't you see that?
They Embrace And Elphaba Runs Off.
Glinda Enters. There Is A House In The Background. The Edge OF The Yellow Brick Road Can Be Seen.
[Burr] That's right, you just take that one road, the whole time. Waves offstage. Oh, I hope they don't get lost. I'm so bad at giving directions. She sees the house, picks up flowers and lays them in front of the house. Oh, Nessa.
Elphaba Appears.
[HAMILTON] What a touching display of grief.
[Burr] I don't think we have anything further to say to one another.
[HAMILTON] I wanted something to remember her by, and all that is left were those shoes, and now that wretched little farm girl has walked off with them. So I'd appreciate some time, alone, to say goodbye to my sister.
Glinda Backs Away As Elphaba Walks Toward The House.
[HAMILTON] Nessa, please, please, please forgive me...
[Burr] Elphie... you mustn't blame yourself. It's dreadful, it is, to have a house fall on you, but accidents will happen.
[HAMILTON] You call this an accident?
[Burr] Yes! Well, maybe not an accident...
[HAMILTON] Well, what do you call it?
[Burr] Well... a regime change. Caused by a bizarre and unexpected twister of fate.
[HAMILTON] You think cyclones just appear out of the blue?
[Burr] I don't know, I never really...
[HAMILTON] No, of course you never! You're too busy telling everyone how wonderful everything is!
[Burr] I'm a public figure, now. People expect me to...
[HAMILTON] Lie?
[Burr] Be encouraging! And what exactly have you been doing besides riding around on that filthy, old thing?
[HAMILTON] Well, we can't all come and go by bubble. Who's invention was that, the Wizard's? Of course, even if it wasn't I'm sure he'd still take credit for it.
[Burr] Yes, well, a lot of us are taking things that don't belong to us, aren't we?
[HAMILTON] Now wait just a clock tick! I know it may be difficult for that blissful, blonde brain of yours to comprehend that someone like him could actually choose someone like me! But it's happened... it's real. And you can wave that ridiculous wand all you want, you can't change it! He never belonged to you, he doesn't love you, and he never did! He loves me!
Glinda Slaps Her.
[HAMILTON] Cackles. Feel better now?
[Burr] Yes, I do.
[HAMILTON] Good, so do I.
She Slaps Glinda. Glinda Then Twirls Her Wand Skillfully And Elphaba Arms Herself With Her Broom. They Charge At Each Other And Then Drop Their "Weapons" And Beat Each Other Senselessly. Glinda Takes Elphaba's Hat Off Her Head And Begins To Whack Her With It. The Guards Run In.
[Guard]
 Halt! In the name of the Wizard!
They Grab Elphaba.
[HAMILTON] Stop! Let me go!
[Burr] Let me go, I almost had her!
[Guard]
 Sorry it took us so long to get here, Miss.
[HAMILTON] I can't believe you would sink this low! To use my sister's death as a trap to capture me?!
[Burr] I never meant for this to happen! Elphie!
Fiyero Swings In On A Rope.
[BURR]
 Let the green girl go!
[Burr] Fiyero, how in [Oz?
[BURR]
 I said let her go! Or explain to all Ozhow the Wizard's guards watched while Glinda the Good was slain.
[Burr] Fiyero...
[BURR]
 I said, let her go.
The Guards Release Her.
[BURR]
 Elphaba, go, now.
[HAMILTON] No, not without you.
[Burr] Fiyero, please.
[BURR]
 Hush! Now! Go!
Elphaba Hesitates.
[Burr] Do it!
She Runs Off.
[Guard]
 Seize him!
[Burr] Wait, what?! What are you doing? Stop it! In the name of goodness, stop! Don't you see? He wasn't going to harm me, he just... he just... he loves her.
[BURR]
 Glinda, I'm so sorry!
[Guard]
 Take him up to that field there! Put him on one of those poles until he tells us where the witch went.
They Drag Him Offstage.
[Burr] No, don't hurt him! Please, don't hurt him! Fiyero!!!!
[HAMILTON] Fiyero!!!!
ELEKA NAHMEN NAHMEN ATUM ATUM ELEKA NAHMEN
ELEKA NAHMEN NAHMEN ATUM ATUM ELEKA NAHMEN
LET HIS FLESH NOT BE TORN LET HIS BLOOD LEAVE NO STAIN,
WILL THEY BEAT HIM, LET HIM FEEL NO PAIN...
LET HIS BONES NEVER BREAK AND HOWEVER THEY TRY TO DESTROY HIM,
LET HIM NEVER DIE, LET HIM NEVER DIE!
ELEKA NAHMEN NAHMEN ATUM ATUM ELEKA NAHMEN
ELEKA NAHMEN NAHMEN ATUM ATUM ELEKA... ELEKA
AH! WHAT GOOD IS THIS CHANTING?
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT I'M READING
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT TRICK I OUGHT TO TRY!
FIYERO WHERE ARE YOU?! ALREADY DEAD OR BLEEDING?
ONE MORE DISASTER I CAN ADD TO MY GENEROUS SUPPLY!
NO GOOD DEED GOES UNPUNISHED
NO ACT OF CHARITY GOES UNRESENTED
NO GOOD DEED GOES UNPUNISHED
THAT'S MY NEW CREED
MY ROAD OF GOOD INTENTIONS
LED WHERE SUCH ROADS ALWAYS LEAD
NO GOOD DEED
GOES UNPUNISHED!
NESSA...
DOCTOR DILLAMOND...
FIYERO...
FIYERO!!!
ONE QUESTION HAUNTS AND HURTS
TOO MUCH, TOO MUCH TO MENTION
WAS I REALLY SEEKING GOOD
OR JUST SEEKING ATTENTION?
IS THAT ALL GOOD DEEDS ARE WHEN LOOKED AT WITH AN ICE COLD EYE?
IF THAT'S ALL GOOD DEEDS ARE
MAYBE THAT'S THE REASON WHY
NO GOOD DEED GOES UNPUNISHED
ALL HELPFUL URGES SHOULD BE CIRCUMVENTED
NO GOOD DEED GOES UNPUNISHED
SURE, I MEANT WELL, WELL LOOK AT WHAT WELL MEANT DID!
ALRIGHT, ENOUGH, SO BE IT!
SO BE IT THEN...
LET ALL OF OzBE AGREED
I'M WICKED THROUGH AND THROUGH
SINCE I COULD NOT SUCCEED
FIYERO SAVING YOU
I PROMISE NO GOOD DEED WILL I ATTEMPT TO DO AGAIN
EVER AGAIN!
NO GOOD DEAD, WILL I DO
AGAIN!!!!!!!!

[Ozia]

GO! AND HUNT HER AND FIND HER AND KILL HER!
Vicious Woman] Good fortune, witch hunters!

[Ozia]

GO! AND HUNT HER AND FIND HER AND KILL HER!
Rabid Man] Kill the witch!
[Ozia]

WICKEDNESS MUST BE PUNISHED
EVIL EFFECTIVELY ELIMINATED
WICKEDNESS MUST BE PUNISHED
KILL THE WITCH!
[Angelica]
 And, this is more than just a service to the Wizard. I have a personal score to settle with Elph... with the witch! Crowd Cheers.
IT'S DUE TO HER I'M MADE OF TIN
HER SPELL MADE THIS OCCUR
SO FOR ONCE I'M GLAD I'M HEARTLESS
I'LL BE HEARTLESS KILLING HER!
And I am not the only one. Looks Offstage. Oh, come on, you! Come out and tell them what she did to you in class that day. How you were just a cub and she cubnapped you.
Lion] No!
[Angelica]

YOU SEE THE LION ALSO
HAS A GRIEVANCE TO REPAY (Lion Roars)
IF SHE'D LET HIM FIGHT HIS OWN BATTLES WHEN HE WAS YOUNG,
HE WOULDN'T BE A COWARD TODAY!

[Burr] No, no, that's not the way it happened! Madame, you've got to stop this, it's gone too far!
[Morrible]
 Oh, I think Elphaba can take care of herself.
[Burr] Madame, something's been troubling me about Nessarose and that cyclone.
[Morrible]
 Oh yes... well, I guess it was just her time.
[Burr] Was it? Or did you...
[Morrible]
 After A Pause. Now, you listen to me, Missy, you may have fooled the rest of Ozwith this "aren't I good" routine, but you know better. You've wanted this since the beginning... and now you're getting what you wanted. So just smile and wave and shut up! Good fortune, good fortune witch hunters!
Rapid Man] Kill her!
Vicious Woman] Kill the witch!
WICKEDNESS MUST BE PUNISHED
BRAVE WITCH HUNTERS I WOULD JOIN YOU IF I COULD
BECAUSE WICKEDNESS MUST BE PUNISHED...
PUNISHED... PUNISHED...
BUT GOOD!!!
[HAMILTON] Oh, for [Oz's sake, stop crying!!! I can't listen to it anymore! Oh, you want to see your Aunt Em and your Uncle What's-his-name again?! Then get those shoes off your feet!!! Little brat... takes a dead woman's shoes; must have been raised in a barn! Chistery! Oh, Chistery, there you are. Where are the others? Chistery motions away. Chistery, please... if you don't at least try to keep speaking you will never... She Sees Glinda. Go away.
[Burr] They're coming for you.
[HAMILTON] Go away!
[Burr] Let the little girl go, and that poor little dog... Dodo.
[Burr] I know you don't want to hear this, but someone has to say it... You are out of control! I mean, come on! They're just shoes, let it go! Elphaba, you can't go on like this.
[HAMILTON] I can do anything I want. I am the Wicked Witch of the West! Another monkey Brings Her A Letter. At last! What took you so long? She Reads It. What's this? Why are you bothering me with this? She Reads On.
[Burr] What is it? What's wrong? It's Fiyero, isn't it? Is he...
[HAMILTON] We've seen his face for the last time.
[Burr] Oh no!
[HAMILTON] You're right... It's time I surrender. Carries A Bucket.
[Burr] Elphie.... Elphie, what is it?
[HAMILTON] You can't be found here! You must go. Refers To A Corner
[Burr] No.
[HAMILTON] You must leave.
[Burr] No! Elphie, I'll tell them everything.
[HAMILTON] No! They'll only turn against you.
[Burr] I don't care!
[HAMILTON] I do! Promise me, promise me, you won't try to clear my name... promise.
[Burr] Alright... I promise. But I don't understand.
[HAMILTON]
I'M LIMITED
JUST LOOK AT ME, I'M LIMITED
AND JUST LOOK AT YOU, YOU CAN DO ALL I COULDN'T DO, GLINDA

[HAMILTON] Here. Go on. Take this. Hands Her The Grimmerie.
[Burr] Elphie... you know I can't read that... Elphie...
[HAMILTON] Well then, you'll have to learn
NOW IT'S UP TO YOU
FOR BOTH OF US
NOW IT'S UP TO YOU
[HAMILTON] You're the only friend I've ever had.
[Burr] And I've had so many friends... but only one that mattered.

[Burr]
I'VE HEARD IT SAID
THAT PEOPLE COME INTO OUR LIVES FOR A REASON
BRINGING SOMETHING WE MUST LEARN
AND WE ARE LED TO THOSE
WHO HELP US MOST TO GROW
IF WE LET THEM
AND WE HELP THEM IN RETURN
WELL, I DON'T KNOW IF I BELIEVE THAT'S TRUE
BUT I KNOW I'M WHO I AM TODAY
BECAUSE I KNEW YOU
LIKE A COMMIT PULLED FROM ORBIT,
AS IT PASSES A SUN
LIKE A STREAM THAT MEETS A BOULDER
HALF WAY THROUGH THE WOOD
WHO CAN SAY IF I'VE BEEN CHANGED FOR THE BETTER?
BUT, BECAUSE I KNEW YOU...
I HAVE BEEN CHANGED
FOR GOOD...
[HAMILTON]
IT WELL MAY BE,
THAT WE WILL NEVER MEET AGAIN
IN THIS LIFETIME
SO LET ME SAY BEFORE WE PART
SO MUCH OF ME
IS MADE OF WHAT I LEARNED FROM YOU
YOU'LL BE WITH ME
LIKE A HANDPRINT ON MY HEART...
AND NOW WHATEVER WAY OUR STORIES END
I KNOW YOU HAVE RE-WRITTEN MINE
BY BEING MY FRIEND...
LIKE A SHIP BLOWN FROM IT'S MOORING
BY A WIND OFF THE SEA
LIKE A SEA DROP BY A SKY BIRD
IN A DISTANT WOOD
WHO CAN SAY IF I'VE BEEN CHANGED FOR THE BETTER?
BUT BECAUSE I KNEW YOU
[Burr]
BECAUSE I KNEW YOU
Both]
I HAVE BEEN CHANGED...
FOR GOOD...
[HAMILTON]
AND JUST TO CLEAR THE AIR
I ASK FORGIVNESS FOR THE THINGS I'VE DONE
YOU BLAME ME FOR.
[Burr]
BUT THEN I GUESS, WE KNOW THERE'S BLAME TO SHARE
Both]
AND NONE OF IT SEEMS TO MATTER ANYMORE!
[Burr] LIKE A COMET PULLED FROM ORBIT AS IT PASSES A SUN...
[HAMILTON] LIKE A SHIP BLOWN FROM ITS MOORING BY A WIND OFF THE SEA
[Burr] LIKE A STREAM THAT MEETS A BOULDER
[HAMILTON] LIKE A SEA DROP BY A BIRD
[Burr] HALFWAY THROUGH THE WOOD
[HAMILTON] IN THE WOOD
[Burr]
WHO CAN SAY IF I'VE BEEN CHANGED FOR THE BETTER?
Both]
I DO BELIEVE I HAVE BEEN CHANGED FOR THE BETTER.
[Burr]
AND, BECAUSE I KNEW YOU
[HAMILTON]
BECAUSE I KNEW YOU
Both]
BECAUSE I KNEW YOU
I HAVE BEEN CHANGED
FOR GOOD...


[HAMILTON] You have to hide. No one can know you were here. Hide yourself!
Elphaba Drapes A Scrim Around The Stage
Offstage Chorus of Women]
AND GOODNESS KNOWS
THE WICKED'S LIVES ARE LONELY
GOODNESS KNOWS THE WICKED DIE ALONE...
LAFAYETE and Other Witch Hunters Run In. You Can See The Silhouette Of The Action Happening Behind The Scrim. Glinda Is Downstage Watching The Action Take Place.
The Mob Surrounds The Witch And She Melts With A Scream The Mob Leaves And Glinda Comes Out From Hiding. She Moves Near The Scrim.
[Burr] Elphie? Elphie? Chistery opens the scrim, where just Elphaba's hat and the green bottle remain. Glinda cries, and grabs the had, holding it against her.
Chistery] Handing Her The Bottle. Miss, Miss Glinda.
[Morrible]
 Well, I don't know why you're so despondiary, I thought it went quite well! They seem thrilled to shreds with their brains and their hearts, and this and that.... Glinda Enters. Oh, Miss Glinda! I thought you'd be out festivating.
[Burr] This was Elphaba's. Holding Out The Bottle.
[Hamilton]
What's that you say?
[Burr] It was a keepsake. It was her mother's. She told me so herself.
I've only seen a little, green bottle like this one other time. It was right here, in this very room. You offered me a drink from it.
Lover's Song Played In Background.
[Hamilton]
But... oh my Lord...
I AM A SENTIMENTAL MAN
WHO ALWAYS LONGED TO BE...
a father...
[Morrible]
 So that was it. That's why she had such powers! She was a child of both worlds!
[Hamilton]
He Cries.
[Burr] I want you to leave [Oz. I'll make the pronouncement myself]
that the strains of wizardship have been too much for you and you are taking an indefinite leave of absence! Did you hear what I said?!
[Hamilton]
Yes, your goodness.
[Burr] You'd better go get your balloon ready. Guards!
He Exits.
[Morrible]
 Glinda, dear, I know we've had our miniscule differentiations in the past...
[Burr] Guards! Madame, have you ever considered how you'd fare in captivity?
[Morrible]
 What?
[Burr] Articulated. Captivity... prison! Personally, I don't think you'll hold up very well.
My professional opinion is that you do not have what it takes. I hope you prove me wrong.
I doubt you will. Take her away!
[Morrible]
 No!!!!

[Ozia]

GOOD NEWS! SHE'S DEAD!
THE WITCH OF THE WEST IS DEAD!
THE WICKEDEST WITCH THERE EVER WAS
THE ENEMY OF ALL OF US, HERE IN [Oz,
IS DEAD!
GOOD NEWS
GOOD NEWS!!!
The Scarecrow (Fiyero) Walks On Stage. He Bends Down & Knocks On A Trap Door In The Floor.
[BURR]
 It worked!
He Opens The Door & Elphaba Climbs Out.
[HAMILTON] Fiyero! I thought you'd never get here.
She Touches His Straw Face.
[BURR]
 Go ahead, touch, I don't mind. Ah, you did the best you could. You saved my life.
[HAMILTON] You're still beautiful.
[BURR]
 You don't have to lie to me.
[HAMILTON] It's not lying... its looking at things another way.
[Ozia]

NO ONE MOURNS THE WICKED
NOW AT LAST SHE'S DEAD AND GONE!
NOW AT LAST THERE'S JOY THROUGHOUT THE LAND!
[Burr] Fellow [Ozians, friends, we have been through a frightening time. There will be other times
and other things that frighten us. But if you let me, I'd like to try to help. I'd like to try to be... Glinda the Good.
[Ozia]

GOOD NEWS!!
[BURR]
 It's time to go.
[HAMILTON] We can never come back to [Oz, can we?
[BURR]
 No.
[HAMILTON] I only wish...
[BURR]
 What?
[HAMILTON] Glinda could know that we're alive.
[BURR]
 She can't know, not if we want to be safe. No one can ever know.
[Ozia]

GOOD NEWS...
[BURR]
 Come...
[Burr]
WHO CAN SAY IF I'VE BEEN CHANGED FOR THE BETTER? BUT...
Elphaba & [Burr]
BECAUSE I KNEW YOU...
[Ozia]

NO ONE MOURNS THE WICKED...
[Burr]
BECAUSE I KNEW YOU...
Elphaba & [Burr]
I HAVE BEEN CHANGED...
Fiyero and Elphaba Leave Through The Clock
[Ozia]

NO ONE MOURNS THE WICKED!
WICKED...
WICKED!!!

Aaron Burr, Sir

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[COMPANY]
1776. New York City

[HAMILTON]
Pardon me. Are you Aaron Burr, sir?

[BURR]
That depends. Who's asking?

[HAMILTON]
Oh, well, sure, sir
I'm Alexander Hamilton, I'm at your service, sir
I have been looking for you

[BURR]
I'm getting nervous

[HAMILTON]
Sir...
I heard your name at Princeton. I was seeking an accelerated course of study when I got sort of out of sorts with a buddy of yours. I may have punched him. It's a blur, sir. He handles the financials?

[BURR]
You punched the bursar

[HAMILTON]
Yes!
I wanted to do what you did. Graduate in two, then join the revolution. He looked at me like I was stupid, I'm not stupid

So how'd you do it? How'd you graduate so fast?

[BURR]
It was my parents' dying wish before they passed

[HAMILTON]
You're an orphan. Of course! I'm an orphan
God, I wish there was a war!
Then we could prove that we're worth more
Than anyone bargained for...

[BURR]
Can I buy you a drink?

[HAMILTON]
That would be nice

[BURR]
While we're talking, let me offer you some free advice
Talk less

[HAMILTON]
What?

[BURR]
Smile more

[HAMILTON]
Ha

[BURR]
Don't let them know what you're against or what you're for

[HAMILTON]
You can't be serious

[BURR]
You wanna get ahead?

[HAMILTON]
Yes

[BURR]
Fools who run their mouths off wind up dead

[LAURE]

Yo yo yo yo yo!
What time is it?

[LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
Show time!

[BURR]
...like I said...

[LAURE]

Show time! Show time! Yo!
I'm John Laurens in the place to be!
Two pints o' Sam Adams, but I'm workin' on three, uh!
Those redcoats don't want it with me!
Cuz I will pop chick-a pop these cops till I'm free!

[LAFAYETTE]
Oui oui, mon ami, je m'appelle Lafayette!
The Lancelot of the revolutionary set!
I came from afar just to say "Bonsoir!"
Tell the King "Casse toi!" Who's the best?
C'est moi!

[MULLIGAN]
Brrrah brraaah! I am Hercules Mulligan
Up in it, lovin' it, yes I heard ya mother said "Come again?"
Lock up ya daughters and horses, of course
It's hard to have intercourse over four sets of corsets...

[LAURE]

No more sex, pour me another brew, son!
Let's raise a couple more...

[LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
To the revolution!

[LAURE]

Well, if it ain't the prodigy of Princeton college!

[MULLIGAN]
Aaron Burr!

[LAURE]

Give us a verse, drop some knowledge!

[BURR]
Good luck with that] you're takin' a stand
You spit. I'm ‘a sit. We'll see where we land

[LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
Boooo!

[LAURE]

Burr, the revolution's imminent. What do you stall for?

[HAMILTON]
If you stand for nothing, Burr, what'll you fall for?
[LAURE]

Ooh
Who are you? [MULLIGAN]
Ooh

Who are you? [LAFAYETTE]
Ooh

Who are you?

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE/LAURE]

Ooh, who is this kid? What's he gonna do?

My Shot

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[HAMILTON]
I am not throwing away my shot!
I am not throwing away my shot!
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot!
I'm ‘a get a scholarship to King's College
I prob'ly shouldn't brag, but dag, I amaze and astonish
The problem is I got a lot of brains but no polish
I gotta holler just to be heard
With every word, I drop knowledge!
I'm a diamond in the rough, a shiny piece of coal
Tryin' to reach my goal. My power of speech] unimpeachable
Only nineteen but my mind is older
These New York City streets get colder, I shoulder
Ev'ry burden, ev'ry disadvantage
I have learned to manage, I don't have a gun to brandish
I walk these streets famished
The plan is to fan this spark into a flame
But damn, it's getting dark, so let me spell out the name
I am the-

[HAMILTON/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN/LAURE]

A-L-E-X-A-N-D
E-R-we are-meant to be...

[HAMILTON]
A colony that runs independently
Meanwhile, Britain keeps shittin' on us endlessly
Essentially, they tax us relentlessly
Then King George turns around, runs a spending spree
He ain't ever gonna set his descendants free
So there will be a revolution in this century
Enter me!

[LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN/LAURE]

(He says in parentheses)

[HAMILTON]
Don't be shocked when your hist'ry book mentions me
I will lay down my life if it sets us free
Eventually, you'll see my ascendancy
[HAMILTON]
And I am not throwing away
My shot
I am not throwing away
My shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot
[LAURE]

My shot!

My shot!

And I'm not throwing away my shot.

[HAMILTON/MULLIGAN/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE]
I am not throwing away my shot
I am not throwing away my shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot
It's time to take a shot!

[LAFAYETTE]
I dream of life without a monarchy
The unrest in France will lead to ‘onarchy?
‘Onarchy? How you say, how you say, ‘anarchy?'
When I fight, I make the other side panicky
With my-

[HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
Shot!

[MULLIGAN]
Yo, I'm a tailor's apprentice
And I got y'all knuckleheads in loco parentis
I'm joining the rebellion cuz I know it's my chance
To socially advance, instead of sewin' some pants!
I'm gonna take a-

[HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
Shot!

[LAURE]

But we'll never be truly free
Until those in bondage have the same rights as you and me
You and I. Do or die. Wait till I sally in
On a stallion with the first black battalion
Have another-

[HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
Shot!

[BURR]
Geniuses, lower your voices
You keep out of trouble and you double your choices
I'm with you, but the situation is fraught
You've got to be carefully taught]
If you talk, you're gonna get shot!

[HAMILTON]
Burr, check what we got
Mister Lafayette, hard rock like Lancelot
I think your pants look hot
Laurens, I like you a lot
Let's hatch a plot blacker than the kettle callin' the pot...
What are the odds the gods would put us all in one spot
Poppin' a squat on conventional wisdom, like it or not
A bunch of revolutionary manumission abolitionists?
Give me a position, show me where the ammunition is!

Oh, am I talkin' too loud?
Sometimes I get over excited, shoot off at the mouth
I never had a group of friends before
I promise that I'll make y'all proud

[LAURE]

Let's get this guy in front of a crowd

[HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN/ENSEMBLE]
I am not throwing away my shot
I am not throwing away my shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot

I am not throwing away my shot

Hey yo, I'm just like my country

I imagine death so much it feels more like a memory
When's it gonna get me?
In my sleep? Seven feet ahead of me?
If I see it comin', do I run or do I let it be?
Is it like a beat without a melody?
See, I never thought I'd live past twenty
Where I come from some get half as many
Ask anybody why we livin' fast and we laugh, reach for a flask
We have to make this moment last, that's plenty

Scratch that
This is not a moment, it's the movement
Where all the hungriest brothers with
Something to prove went?
Foes oppose us, we take an honest stand
We roll like Moses, claimin' our promised land
And? If we win our independence?
‘Zat a guarantee of freedom for our descendants?
Or will the blood we shed begin an endless
Cycle of vengeance and death with no defendants?
I know the action in the street is excitin'
But Jesus, between all the bleedin' ‘n fightin'
I've been readin' ‘n writin'
We need to handle our financial situation
Are we a nation of states? What's the state of our nation?
I'm past patiently waitin'. I'm passionately
Smashin' every expectation
Every action's an act of creation!
I'm laughin' in the face of casualties and sorrow
For the first time, I'm thinkin' past tomorrow

[HAMILTON AND COMPANY]
And I am not throwing away my shot
I am not throwing away my shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country

Farmer Refuted

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[SEABURY]
Hear ye, hear ye! My name is Samuel Seabury
And I present "Free Thoughts on the
Proceedings of the Continental Congress!"
Heed not the rabble who scream revolution
They have not your interests at heart

[MULLIGAN]
Oh my God. Tear this dude apart

[SEABURY]
Chaos and bloodshed are not a solution
Don't let them lead you astray
This Congress does not speak for me

[BURR]
Let him be

[SEABURY]
They're playing a dangerous game
I pray the king shows you his mercy
For shame, for shame...
[HAMILTON]
Yo!
He'd have you all unravel at the
Sound of screams but the
Revolution is comin'
The have-nots are gonna
Win this
It's hard to listen to you with a straight face

Chaos and bloodshed already haunt us, honestly you shouldn't even talk. And what about Boston? Look at the cost, n' all that we've lost n' you talk
About Congress?!

My dog speaks more eloquently than thee!

But strangely, your mange is the same

Is he in Jersey?

For the revolution!
[SEABURY]
Heed not the rabble
Who scream
Revolution, they
Have not your
Interests
At heart

Chaos and bloodshed are
Not a
Solution. Don't
Let them lead you
Astray
This Congress does not
Speak for me

They're playing a dangerous game

I pray the king shows you his mercy

For shame

For shame,

[COMPANY]
For the revolution!

[SEABURY]
Heed-

[HAMILTON]
If you repeat yourself again I'm gonna-

[SEABURY/HAMILTON]
Scream-

[HAMILTON]
Honestly, look at me, please don't read!

[SEABURY]
Not your interests-

[HAMILTON]
Don't modulate the key then not debate with me!
Why should a tiny island across the sea regulate the price of tea?

[BURR]
Alexander, please!

[HAMILTON]
Burr, I'd rather be divisive than indecisive, drop the niceties

Silence! A message from the King!

You'll Be Back

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[KING GEORGE]
You say
The price of my love's not a price that you're willing to pay
You cry
In your tea which you hurl in the sea when you see me go by
Why so sad?
Remember we made an arrangement when you went away
Now you're making me mad
Remember, despite our estrangement, I'm your man
You'll be back
Soon you'll see
You'll remember you belong to me
You'll be back
Time will tell
You'll remember that I served you well
Oceans rise
Empires fall
We have seen each other through it all
And when push
Comes to shove
I will send a fully armed battalion
To remind you of my love!

Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da
Da da dat dat da ya da!
Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da
Da da dat dat da...

You say our love is draining and you can't go on
You'll be the one complaining when I am gone...
And no, don't change the subject
Cuz you're my favorite subject
My sweet, submissive subject
My loyal, royal subject
Forever and ever and ever and ever and ever...

You'll be back
Like before
I will fight the fight and win the war
For your love
For your praise
And I'll love you till my dying days
When you're gone
I'll go mad
So don't throw away this thing we had

Cuz when push comes to shove
I will kill your friends and family to remind you of my love
Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da
Da da dat dat da ya da!
Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da
Da da dat-
Everybody!

[ENSEMBLE]
Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da

Buck, buck, buck, buck, buck!

Buck, buck, buck, buck, buck!

[WASHINGTON]
Check it-
Can I be real a second?
For just a millisecond?
Let down my guard and tell the people how I feel a second?
Now I'm the model of a modern major general
The venerated Virginian veteran whose men are all
Lining up, to put me up on a pedestal
Writin' letters to relatives
Embellishin' my elegance and eloquence
But the elephant is in the room
The truth is in ya face when ya hear the British cannons go...

[ENSEMBLE]
Boom!

[WASHINGTON]
Any hope of success is fleeting
How can I keep leading when the people I'm
Leading keep retreating?
We put a stop to the bleeding as the British take Brooklyn
Knight takes rook, but look
[WASHINGTON]
We are outgunned

Outmanned

Outnumbered
Outplanned

We gotta make an all out stand
Ayo, I'm gonna need a right-hand man

There's another ship and...

Boom!

[WASHINGTON]
We just lost the southern tip and...

[COMPANY]
Boom!

[WASHINGTON]
We gotta run to Harlem quick, we can't afford another slip
Guns and horses giddyup
I decide to divvy up
My forces, they're skittish as the British cut the city up
This close to giving up, facing mad scrutiny
I scream in the face of this mass mutiny]
Are these the men with which I am to defend America?
We ride at midnight, Manhattan in the distance
I cannot be everywhere at once, people
I'm in dire need of assistance...

[BURR]
Your excellency, sir!

[WASHINGTON]
Who are you?

[BURR]
Aaron Burr, Sir?
Permission to state my case?

[WASHINGTON]
As you were

[BURR]
Sir
I was a captain under General Montgomery
Until he caught a bullet in the neck in Quebec
And well, in summary
I think that I could be of some assistance
I admire how you keep firing on the British
From a distance

[WASHINGTON]
Huh

[BURR]
I have some questions, a couple of suggestions on how to fight instead of fleeing west

[WASHINGTON]
Yes?

[BURR]
Well-

[HAMILTON]
Your excellency, you wanted to see me?

[WASHINGTON]
Hamilton, come in, have you met Burr?

[HAMILTON]
Yes, sir

[HAMILTON AND BURR]
We keep meeting

[BURR]
As I was saying, sir, I look forward to seeing your strategy play out

[WASHINGTON]
Burr?

[BURR]
Sir?

[WASHINGTON]
Close the door on your way out

[HAMILTON]
Have I done something wrong, sir?

[WASHINGTON]
On the contrary
I called you here because our odds are beyond scary
Your reputation precedes you, but I have to laugh

[HAMILTON]
Sir?

[WASHINGTON]
Hamilton, how come no one can get you on their staff?

[HAMILTON]
Sir!

[WASHINGTON]
Don't get me wrong, you're a young man, of great renown
I know you stole British cannons when we were still downtown
Nathaniel Green and Henry Knox wanted to hire you...

[HAMILTON]
To be their Secretary? I don't think so

[WASHINGTON]
Why're you upset?

[HAMILTON]
I'm not-

[WASHINGTON]
It's alright, you want to fight, you've got a hunger
I was just like you when I was younger
Head full of fantasies of dyin' like a martyr?

[HAMILTON]
Yes

[WASHINGTON]
Dying is easy, young man. Living is harder

[HAMILTON]
Why are you telling me this?

[WASHINGTON]
I'm being honest
I'm working with a third of what our Congress has promised
We are a powder keg about to explode
I need someone like you to lighten the load. So?

[COMPANY (EXCEPT HAMILTON)]
I am not throwin' away my shot!
I am not throwin' away my shot!
Ayo, I'm just like my country, I'm young
Scrappy and hungry!

We are outgunned, outmanned!

[HAMILTON]
You need all the help you can get
I have some friends. Laurens, Mulligan
Marquis de Lafayette, okay, what else?

[WASHINGTON AND COMPANY]
Outnumbered, outplanned!

[HAMILTON]
We'll need some spies on the inside
Some King's men who might let some things slide
[HAMILTON]
I'll write to Congress and tell ‘em we need supplies, you rally the guys, master the element of surprise

I'll rise above my station, organize your information, ‘til we rise to the occasion of our new nation. Sir!

A Winter's Ball

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[BURR]
How does the bastard, orphan, son of a whore
Go on and on
Grow into more of a phenomenon?
Watch this obnoxious, arrogant, loudmouth bother
Be seated at the right hand of the father
Washington hires Hamilton right on sight
But Hamilton still wants to fight, not write
Now Hamilton's skill with a quill is undeniable
But what do we have in common? We're
Reliable with the

Helpless!
Look into your eyes, and the sky's the limit I'm helpless!
Down for the count, and I'm drownin' in ‘em

[ELIZA]
I have never been the type to try and grab the spotlight
We were at a revel with some rebels on a hot night
Laughin' at my sister as she's dazzling the room
Then you walked in and my heart went "Boom!"
Tryin' to catch your eye from the side of the ballroom
Everybody's dancin' and the band's top volume

[ELIZA AND WOMEN]
Grind to the rhythm as we wine and dine
[ELIZA]
Grab my sister, and
Whisper, "Yo, this
One's mine."

My sister made her way across the room to you
And I got nervous, thinking "What's she gonna do?"
She grabbed you by the arm, I'm thinkin' "I'm through"
Then you look back at me and suddenly I'm
Helpless!

Oh, look at those eyes

Oh!
Yeah, I'm
Helpless, I know

I'm so into you
I am so into you

I know I'm down for the count
And I'm drownin' in ‘em.

Oooh

Oooh

Oooh

Oooh

Look into your eyes
And the sky's the limit

I'm helpless!

Look into your eyes
And the sky's the limit I'm helpless!

[HAMILTON]

[ANGELICA]
My sister

[ELIZA]
Thank you for all your service

[HAMILTON]
If it takes fighting a war for us to meet, it will have been worth it

[ANGELICA]
I'll leave you to it

[ELIZA AND WOMEN]
One week later

[ELIZA]
I'm writin' a letter nightly
Now my life gets better, every letter that you write me
Laughin' at my sister, cuz she wants to form a harem

[ANGELICA]
I'm just sayin', if you really loved me, you would share him
[ELIZA]
Ha!
Two weeks later
In the living room stressin'
My father's stone-faced
While you're asking for his blessin'
I'm dying inside, as
You wine
And dine
And I'm tryin' not to cry
‘cause there's nothing that your mind can't do
My father makes his way across the room
To you
I panic for a second, thinking
"we're through"
But then he shakes your hand and says
"Be true"
And you turn back to me, smiling, and I'm
Helpless!

Helpless!

[HAMILTON]
Eliza, I don't have a dollar to my name
An acre of land, a troop to command, a dollop of fame
All I have's my honor, a tolerance for pain
A couple of college credits and my top-notch brain
Insane, your family brings out a different side of me
Peggy confides in me, Angelica tried to take a bite of me
No stress, my love for you is never in doubt
We'll get a little place in Harlem and we'll figure it out
I've been livin' without a family since I was a child
My father left, my mother died, I grew up buckwild
But I'll never forget my mother's face, that was real
And long as I'm alive, Eliza, swear to God
You'll never feel so...

[HAMILTON]
Eliza...

I've never felt so-

My life is gon' be fine cuz Eliza's in it.
[ELIZA]
I do I do I do I do!

I do I do I do I do!

Hey, yeah, yeah!

I'm down for the count
I'm-

I look into your eyes, and the sky's the limit
I'm

...drownin' in ‘em. [ALL WOMEN]
Helpless!

Helpless!

Satisfied

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[LAURE]

Alright, alright. That's what I'm talkin' about!
Now everyone give it up for the maid of honor
Angelica Schuyler!
[ANGELICA]
A toast to the groom!

To the bride!

From your sister

Who is always by your side

To your union

And the hope that you provide

May you always...

Be satisfied.

[ALL MEN]
To the groom!
To the groom!
To the groom!

To the bride!
To the bride!

Angelica!
Angelica!
Angelica!

By your side!

To the union!
To the revolution!

You provide!
You provide!

[HAMILTON AND MEN]
Always-

Rewind-

[ALL WOMEN]
To the groom!

To the bride!

To the bride!

[ELIZA AND WOMEN]
Angelica!

By your side!

To the union!
To the revolution!

You provide!

Always-

Rewind-

[ANGELICA]
I remember that night, I just might
Regret that night for the rest of my days

I remember those soldier boys
Tripping over themselves to win our praise

I remember that dreamlike candlelight
Like a dream that you can't quite place

But Alexander, I'll never forget the first
Time I saw your face

I have never been the same
Intelligent eyes in a hunger-pang frame
And when you said "Hi," I forgot my dang name
Set my heart aflame, ev'ry part aflame

[FULL COMPANY]
This is not a game...

[HAMILTON]
You strike me as a woman who has never been satisfied

[ANGELICA]
I'm sure I don't know what you mean. You forget yourself

[HAMILTON]
You're like me. I'm never satisfied

[ANGELICA]
Is that right?

[HAMILTON]
I have never been satisfied

[ANGELICA]
My name is Angelica Schuyler

[HAMILTON]
Alexander Hamilton

[ANGELICA]
Where's your fam'ly from?

[HAMILTON]
Unimportant. There's a million things I haven't done but
Just you wait, just you wait...

[ANGELICA]
So so so-
So this is what it feels like to match wits
With someone at your level! What the hell is the catch? It's
The feeling of freedom, of seein' the light
It's Ben Franklin with a key and a kite! You see it, right?
The conversation lasted two minutes, maybe three minutes
Ev'rything we said in total agreement, it's
A dream and it's a bit of a dance
A bit of a posture, it's a bit of a stance. He's a
Bit of a flirt, but I'm ‘a give it a chance
I asked about his fam'ly, did you see his answer?
His hands started fidgeting, he looked askance?
He's penniless, he's flying by the seat of his pants

Handsome, boy, does he know it!
Peach fuzz, and he can't even grow it!
I wanna take him far away from this place
Then I turn and see my sister's face and she is...

[ELIZA]
Helpless...

[ANGELICA]
And I know she is...

[ELIZA]
Helpless...

[ANGELICA]
And her eyes are just...

[ELIZA]
Helpless...

[ANGELICA]
And I realize

[ANGELICA AND COMPANY]
Three fundamental truths at the exact same time...

[HAMILTON]
Where are you taking me?

[ANGELICA]
I'm about to change your life

[HAMILTON]
Then by all means, lead the way

[COMPANY (EXCEPT ANGELICA)]
Number one!

[ANGELICA]
I'm a girl in a world in which
My only job is to marry rich
My father has no sons so I'm the one
Who has to social climb for one
So I'm the oldest and the wittiest and the gossip in
New York City is insidious
Alexander is penniless
Ha! That doesn't mean I want him any less

[ELIZA]
Elizabeth Schuyler. It's a pleasure to meet you

[HAMILTON]
Schuyler?

[ANGELICA]
My sister

[COMPANY]
Number two!

[ANGELICA]
He's after me cuz I'm a Schuyler sister
That elevates his status, I'd
Have to be naïve to set that aside
Maybe that is why I introduce him to Eliza
Now that's his bride
Nice going, Angelica, he was right
You will never be satisfied

[ELIZA]
Thank you for all your service

[HAMILTON]
If it takes fighting a war for us to meet, it will have been worth it

[ANGELICA]
I'll leave you to it

[COMPANY]
Number three!

[ANGELICA]
I know my sister like I know my own mind
You will never find anyone as trusting or as kind
If I tell her that I love him she'd be silently resigned
He'd be mine
She would say, "I'm fine"

[ANGELICA AND COMPANY]
She'd be lying

[ANGELICA]
But when I fantasize at night
It's Alexander's eyes
As I romanticize what might
Have been if I hadn't sized him
Up so quickly
At least my dear Eliza's his wife;
At least I keep his eyes in my life...
[ANGELICA]
To the groom!

To the bride!

From your sister

Who is always by your side

To your union

And the hope that you provide

May you always

Be satisfied

And I know

She'll be happy as

His bride
And I know [ALL MEN (EXCEPT HAMILTON)]
To the groom!
To the groom!
To the groom!

To the bride!
To the bride!

Angelica!
Angelica!

By your side

To the union!
To the revolution!

You provide!
You provide!

[HAMILTON AND MEN]
Always-

Be satisfied

Be satisfied

[MEN]
Be satisfied
Be satisfied
Be satisfied
Be satisfied

Be satisfied
Be satisfied

Be satisfied
Be satisfied
Be satisfied
Be satisfied.

[ALL WOMEN (EXCEPT ELIZA)]
To the groom!

To the bride!

To the bride!

[ELIZA AND WOMEN]
Angelica!

By your side

To the union!
To the revolution!

You provide!

Always-

Be satisfied

[WOMEN]
Be satisfied

Be satisfied

Be satisfied.

[ANGELICA]
He will never be satisfied
I will never be satisfied

The Story of Tonight (Reprise)

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[LAURE]

I may not live to see our glory!

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE]
I may not live to see our glory!

[LAURE]

But I've seen wonders great and small

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE]
I've seen wonders great and small

[LAURE]

‘Cause if the tomcat can get married

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE]
If Alexander can get married-

[LAURE]

There's hope for our ass, after all!

[LAFAYETTE]
Raise a glass to freedom

[LAURENS/MULLIGAN]
Hey!
Something you will never see again!

[MULLIGAN]
No matter what she tells you

[LAFAYETTE]
Let's have another round tonight!

[LAURE]

Raise a glass to the four of us!

[LAFAYETTE/HAMILTON]
Ho!

[MULLIGAN]
To the newly not poor of us!

[LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/HAMILTON]
Woo!

[LAFAYETTE]
We'll tell the story of tonight

[LAURE]

Let's have another round-

[HAMILTON]
Well, if it isn't Aaron Burr

[BURR]
Sir!

[HAMILTON]
I didn't think that you would make it

[BURR]
To be sure

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE]
Burr!

[BURR]
I came to say congratulations

[MULLIGAN]
Spit a verse, Burr!

[BURR]
I see the whole gang is here

[LAFAYETTE]
You are the worst, Burr!

[HAMILTON]
Ignore them. Congrats to you, Lieutenant Colonel
I wish I had your command instead of manning George's journal

[BURR]
No, you don't

[HAMILTON]
Yes, I do

[BURR]
Now, be sensible
From what I hear, you've made yourself indispensable

[LAURE]

Well, well, I heard
You've got a special someone on the side, Burr

[HAMILTON]
Is that so?

[LAURE]

What are you tryin' to hide, Burr?

[BURR]
I should go

[HAMILTON]
No, these guys should go

[LAFAYETTE]
What?

[LAURE]

No!

[HAMILTON]
Leave us alone

[MULLIGAN]
Man...

[HAMILTON]
It's alright, Burr. I wish you'd brought this girl with you tonight, Burr

[BURR]
You're very kind, but I'm afraid it's unlawful, sir

[HAMILTON]
What do you mean?

[BURR]
She's married

[HAMILTON]
I see

[BURR]
She's married to a British officer

[HAMILTON]
Oh shit...

[BURR]
Congrats again, Alexander. Smile more
I'll see you on the other side of the war

[HAMILTON]
I will never understand you
If you love this woman, go get her! What are you waiting for?

[BURR]
I'll see you on the other side of the war

[HAMILTON]
I'll see you on the other side of the war

Wait For It

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[BURR]
Theodosia writes me a letter everyday
I'm keeping the bed warm while her husband is away
He's on the British side in Georgia
He's trying to keep the colonies in line
But he can keep all of Georgia
Theodosia, she's mine

Love doesn't discriminate
Between the sinners
And the saints
It takes and it takes and it takes
And we keep loving anyway
We laugh and we cry
And we break
And we make our mistakes
And if there's a reason I'm by her side
When so many have tried
Then I'm willing to wait for it
I'm willing to wait for it
[BURR]
My grandfather was a fire and brimstone preacher

But there are things that the
Homilies and hymns won't teach ya

My mother was a genius

My father commanded respect

When they died they left no instructions
Just a legacy to protect

[MEN]
Preacher, preacher
Preacher

Teach ya, teach ya, teach ya

Respect, respect

[WOMEN]
Genius


[LAURE]

GOOD NEWS, SHE'S DEAD!
THE WITCH OF THE WEST IS DEAD!
THE WICKEDEST WITCH THERE EVER WAS,
THE ENEMY OF ALL OF US HERE IN [,
IS DEAD! GOOD NEWS! GOOD NEWS!

[LAURE]

Look, it's Glinda!


[LAURE]

floats in on a giant bubble

[LAURE]

 It's good to see me, isn't it? ([Ozians Agree) No need to respond that was rhetorical. Fellow [Ozia]


[BURR]
LET US BE GLAD,
LET US BE GRATEFUL,
LET US REJOICIFY THAT GOODNESS COULD SUBDUE
THE WICKED WORKINGS OF YOU KNOW WHO!
ISN'T IT NICE TO KNOW
THAT GOOD WILL CONQUER EVIL?
THE TRUTH WE ALL BELIEVE'LL BY AND BY
OUTLIVE A LIE
FOR YOU AND...

[BURR]
Glinda! Exactly how dead is she?

[[Burr] Well, there has been much rumor and speculation... innuendo, outuendo...
but let me set the record straight. According to the Time Dragon Clock, the melting occurred at the 13th hour;
a direct result of a bucket of water thrown by a female child. Yes, the Wicked Witch of the West is dead!

[Ozian]
NO ONE MOURNS THE WICKED!

[Ozian]
NO ONE CRIES THEY WON'T RETURN!

[Ozia]

NO ONE LAYS A LILY ON THEIR GRAVE!
[Ozian Man]
THE GOOD MAN SCORNS THE WICKED!
Women]
THROUGH THEIR LIVES OUR CHILDREN LEARN!

[Ozia]

WHAT WE MISS WHEN WE MISBEHAVE!
[Burr]
AND GOODNESS KNOWS
THE WICKEDS' LIVES ARE LONELY
GOODNESS KNOWS
THE WICKED DIE ALONE
IT JUST SHOWS WHEN YOU'RE WICKED
YOU'RE LEFT ONLY
ON YOUR OWN
[Ozia]

YES, GOODNESS KNOWS
THE WICKEDS' LIVES ARE LONELY
GOODNESS KNOWS
THE WICKED CRY ALONE
NOTHING GROWS FOR THE WICKED
THEY REAP ONLY
WHAT THEY'VE SEWN
[Ozian] Glinda, why does wickedness happen?
[Burr] That's a good question; one that many people find confusifying. Are people born wicked,
or do they have wickedness thrust upon them? After all, she had a childhood,;
She had a father, who just happed to be the governor of munchlinkland Witch's Parents Enter.

[Frex]
 I'm off to the assembly, dear.
[Burr] She had a mother, as so many do...
[Frex]

HOW I HATE TO GO AND LEAVE YOU LONELY
Melena]
THAT'S ALRIGH IT'S ONLY JUST ONE NIGHT
[Frex]

BUT KNOW THAT YOU'RE HERE, IN MY HEART
WHILE I'M OUT OF YOUR SIGHT!
Frex Exits. A Lover Runs Into The Room.
[Burr] And like all families, they had their secrets.
Lover]
HAVE ANOTHER DRINK, MY DARK EYED BEAUTY,
I'VE GOT ONE MORE NIGHT LEFT HERE IN TOWN,
SO HAVE ANOTHER DRINK OF GREEN ELIXER
AND WE'LL HAVE OURSELVES A LITTLE MIXER
HAVE ANOTHER LITTLE SWALLOW LITTLE LADY,
AND FOLLOW ME DOWN
[Burr] And of course, from the moment she was born she was... well... different!
Midwife] AHHH!! It's coming!
[Frex]
 Now?
Midwife] The baby's coming!
[Frex]
 And how!

Midwife]
I SEE A NOSE!
[Frex]

I SEE A CURL!
Both]
IT'S A HEALTHY, PERFECT, LOVELY LITTLE...
(They Scream)
Melena] What is it? What's wrong?
Midwife]
HOW CAN IT BE?
[Frex]

WHAT DOES IT MEAN?
Midwife]
IT'S ATTROCIOUS!
[Frex]

IT'S OBSCENE!
Both]
LIKE A FROGGY, FERNY CABBAGE,
THE BABY IS UNATURALLY
GREEN!!!
[Frex]
 Take it away... Take it away!!!!
[Burr] So you see, it couldn't have been easy!

Munchki]

NO ONE MOURNS THE WICKED!
NOW AT LAST, SHE'S DEAD AND GONE!
NOW AT LAST THERE'S JOY THROUGHOUT THE LAND!
AND GOODNESS KNOWS (GOODNESS KNOWS)
WE KNOW WHAT GOODNESS IS (OOOOHHHH)
GOODNESS KNOWS, THE WICKED DIE ALONE (SHE DIED ALONE)
WOE TO THOSE (WOE TO THOSE)
WHO SPURN WHAT GOODNESSES THEY ARE SHOWN!
NO ONE MOURNS THE WICKED (GOOD NEWS)
NO ONE MOURNS THE WICKED (GOOD NEWS)
NO ONE MOURNS... THE WICKED...
WICKED...
WICKED!!!!!
[Burr] Well, this has been fun! But as you can imagine I have much to attend to,
what with the Wizard's unexpected departure. So, if there are no further questions...
[Ozian] Glinda, is it true you were her friend?
[Ozians Gasp
[Burr] Well, I... you see... um... yes.
Louder Gasps
[Burr] Well, it depends on what you mean by "friend". She Motions Her Bubble Downward.
I did know her. That is, our paths did cross... at school. But you must understand, it was a long time ago and we were both very young.

[Students]

O, HALLOWED HALLS AND VINE DRAPED WALLS
THE PROUDLIEST SITE THERE IS.
WHEN GREY AND SEER OUR HAIR HATH TURNED,
WE SHALL STILL REVERE THE LESSONS LEARNED
IN OUR DAYS AT DEAR OLD SHIZ (DEAR OLD SHIZ)

SHIZZZZZZZZZZZ (DEAR OLD SHIZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ)
Frex Wheels Nessarose On Stage.
[HAMILTON]
 What?! What are you looking at? Oh, do I have something in my teeth?
Okay, let's get this over with. No, I'm not seasick, yes, I've always been green, no, I didn't chew grass as a child.
[Frex]
 Elphaba!
[HAMILTON] Oh, this is my younger sister, Nessarose. As you can see, she is a perfectly normal color.
[Frex]
 Elphaba, stop making a spectacle of yourself! I'm only sending you here for one reason...
[HAMILTON] Yes, I know, to look after Nessarose.
Frex Holds Out A Box.
[Frex]
 My precious little girl] a parting gift.
[Angelica]
 Now, father... He Pulls Silver Shoes From The Box. Jeweled shoes!
[Frex]
 As befits the future governor of Munchkinland. Elphaba, take care of your sister.
And try not to talk so much! He Kisses Nessarose And Exits.
[Angelica]
 Elphaba...
[HAMILTON] Well what could he have gotten me? I clash with everything!
Mme. Morrible Enters
[Morrible]
 Welcome, new students! I am Madame Morrible, headmistress here, at Shiz University.
And whether you're here to study logic, literature, or linguification,
I know I speak for my fellow faculty members when I say we have nothing but the highest hopes for some of you.
Now, regarding room assignments... Elphaba & Galinda Raise Their Hands.
She Notices Galinda First. Yes, is this regarding room assignments?
[linda]

 Oh, Madame, thank you for asking, but I've already been assigned a private suite...
Noticing Her Followers' Disappointment. But you can all come visit me whenever you want!
Shen Shen] How good of you!
Pfanee] You are so good!
[linda]

 No I'm not!
Both] Yes you are!
[linda]

 Now stop! Swishes Her Hair.
[Morrible]
 Do you have a question?

[linda]

 Yes, you see, I am Galinda Upland of the Upperuplands... I've applied to your sorcery seminar,
and indeed that is my sole purpose of attending Shiz; to study sorcery with you.
Perhaps you recall my essay, "Magic Wands, Need They Have A Point".
[Morrible]
 Yes... However, I do not teach my seminar every semester, unless, of course, somebody special were to come along.
[linda]

 Well, exactly!
[HAMILTON] We have not yet received our room assignments.
[Morrible]
 Yes, yes, of course! Oh, You must be Miss Nessarose, the governor's daughter.
What a tragically beautiful face you have! Sees Elphaba, snorts...And you must be.
[HAMILTON] I'm the other daughter. Elphaba. I'm beautifully tragic.
[Morrible]
 Yes, yes, I'm sure you're very bright.
[linda]

 Bright? She's phosphorescent.
[Morrible]
 I don't seem to have you on my list. Oh, well a slight gulch, but not to fret! We'll find someplace to put you.
[linda]

 Y'know, I don't even think she read my essay.
Shen Shen] That's so unfair!
[Angelica]
 You should say something!
[linda]

 Should I?
Pfanee] Do it!
[Morrible]
 Now, which one of you young ladies would like to volunteer to share with Miss Elphaba?
[linda]

 Madame Morrible...
[Morrible]
 Thank you dear. Oh, how very good of you!
[linda]

 What?
[Morrible]
 Miss Elphaba, you may share with Miss Galinda.
[linda]

 Huh?
[Morrible]
 The governor made his concern for your sister's well being quite clear.
So, I thought it would be best if she share my private compartment where I can assist her as needed...
[HAMILTON] But Madame, I've always looked after my sister.
[Morrible]
 Everyone, to your dormitories.
[HAMILTON] But Madame...
[HAMILTON] Let her go!!!
Nessarose's Wheelchair Is Torn From Morrible's Hands And Begins To Wheel Itself Back To Elphaba.
[Morrible]
 How did you do that?
[linda]

 How did she do that?
[Angelica]
 Elphaba!
[Morrible]
 You mean this has happened before?
[HAMILTON] Uh... Something just comes over me sometimes... I'm sorry, Madame.
[Morrible]
 What? Never apologize for talent! Talent is a gift! Have you ever considered a career in sorcery?
[HAMILTON] Sorcery?
[Morrible]
 I shall tutor you myself, and take no other students.
[linda]

 What?
All Students But Galinda Exit.
[Morrible]
 Oh, Miss Elphaba...
MANY YEARS I HAVE WAITED
FOR A GIFT LIKE YOURS TO APPEAR
WHY I PREDICT THE WIZARD COULD MAKE YOU HIS
MAGIC, GRAND VIZIER!
MY DEAR, MY DEAR,
I'LL WRITE AT ONCE TO THE WIZARD
TELL HIM OF YOU IN ADVANCE
WITH A TALENT LIKE YOURS, DEAR, THERE IS
A DEFIN-ISH CHANCE
IF YOU WORK AS YOU SHOULD
YOU'LL BE MAKING GOOD
[linda]

 Madame Morrible...
[Morrible]
 No, not now dearest. She Exits.
[Burr] This will just make me a better person. She simles.
She Runs Off.

[HAMILTON]
DID THAT REALLY JUST HAPPEN?
HAVE I ACTUALLY UNDERSTOOD?
THIS WEIRD QUIRK I'VE TRIED TO SURPRESS OR HIDE
IS A TALENT THAT COULD HELP ME MEET THE WIZARD
IF I MAKE GOOD
SO I'LL MAKE GOOD.
WHEN I MEET THE WIZARD,
ONCE I PROVE MY WORTH,
AND THEN I MEET THE WIZARD,
WHAT I'VE WAITED FOR SINCE
SINCE BIRTH!
AND WITH ALL HIS WIZARD WISDOM
BY MY LOOKS HE WON'T BE BLINDED
DO YOU THINK THE WIZARD IS DUMB?
OR LIKE MUNCHKINS SO SMALL-MINDED? NO!
HE'LL SAY TO ME "I SEE WHO YOU TRULY ARE,
A GIRL ON WHOM I CAN RELY"
AND THAT'S HOW WE'LL BEGIN,
THE WIZARD AND I
ONCE I'M WITH THE WIZARD,
MY WHOLE LIFE WILL CHANGE,
'CUZ ONCE YOU'RE WITH THE WIZARD
NO ONE THINKS YOU'RE STRANGE
NO FATHER IS NOT PROUD OF YOU,
NO SISTER ACTS ASHAMED,
AND ALL OF OzHAS TO LOVE YOU
WHEN BY THE WIZARD YOU'RE ACLAIMED
AND THIS GIFT OR THIS CURSE
THAT I HAVE INSIDE
MAYBE AT LAST I'LL KNOW WHY
WHEN WE ARE HAND IN HAND,
THE WIZARD AND I
AND ONE DAY HE'LL SAY TO ME, "ELPHABA,
A GIRL WHO IS SO SUPERIOR,
SHOULDN'T A GIRL WHO'S SO GOOD INSIDE
HAVE A MATCHING EXTERIOR?
AND SINCE FOLKS HERE TO AN OBSURED DEGREE
SEEM FIXATED ON YOUR VERDEGRIS
WOULD IT BE ALRIGHT BY YOU
IF I DEGREENIFY YOU?"
AND OF COURSE THAT'S NOT IMPORTANT TO ME
"ALRIGHT! WHY NOT?" I'LL REPLY
OH, WHAT A PAIR WE'LL BE
THE WIZARD AND I
YES, WHAT A PAIR WE'LL BE
THE WIZARD AND...
UNLIMITED, MY FUTURE IS UNLIMITED
AND I'VE JUST HAD A VISION ALMOST LIKE A PROPHECY
I KNOW
IT SOUNDS TRULY CRAZY
AND TRUE, THE VISION'S HAZY
BUT I SWEAR SOME DAY THERE'LL BE
A CELEBRATION THROUGHOUT [Oz
THAT'S ALL TO DO
WITH ME!
AND I'LL STAND THERE WITH THE WIZARD
FEELING THINGS I'VE NEVER FELT
AND THOUGH I'D NEVER SHOW IT
I'D BE SO HAPPY I COULD MELT!
AND SO IT WILL BE FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE
AND I'LL WANT NOTHING ELSE 'TILL I DIE
HELD IN SUCH HIGH ESTEEM!
WHEN PEOPLE SEE ME THEY WILL SCREAM
FOR HALF OF [Oz'S FAVORITE TEAM]
THE WIZARD...
AND I!!!!

[linda]

 LOATHING................... LOATHING....... LOATHING YOU!
Both] LOATHING, TRULY, DEEPLY LOATHING YOU!
[Students]
 ............................ LOATHING, UNADULTERATED LOATHING!!!
Both] MY WHOLE LIFE LONG!!!!
[HAMILTON] Boo!
[linda]

 Ahh!
[HAMILTON] Hahahaha!

[Hamilton]
 Settle down, now! I have read your most recent essays. And I am amazed to report the progress!
Although, some of us still tend to favor form over content... Ms. Glinda.
[linda]

 It's GAlinda.
[Hamilton]
 Excuse me... Glinda.
[linda]

 I really don't see what the problem is. Every other professor seems to be able to pronounce my name.
[HAMILTON] Maybe pronouncing your precious name isn't the sole purpose of Doctor Dillamond's life. Maybe he's not like every other professor. Maybe some of us are different.
[linda]

 Oh! It seems the artichoke is steamed.
[Hamilton]
 Class, class! Miss Elphaba has a point! As you know, I am the sole Animal on the faculty. The token Goat, as it were. But it wasn't always this way. Oh, dear students, how I wish you could have seen it as it once was. Where you could walk down the halls and see an antelope explicating a sonnet, a snow leopard solving an equation, a wildebeast waxing philosophic. Don't you see, dear students, how our dear Ozis becoming less and less...looks at Elphaba... colorful. Now, who can tell me what sent these events into motion?
[HAMILTON] Raises hand From what I've heard, it all started with the great drought.
[Hamilton]
 Exactly. Food grew scarce, people grew hungrier and angrier. And the question became "Whom can we blame?" Can anyone tell me what is meant by the term "Scapegoat"? Elphaba Raises Hand. Someone besides Miss Elphaba? Ah yes, Miss Glinda...
[linda]

 It's GAlinda... with a GA. I don't see why you can't just teach us history instead of always harping on the past.
[Hamilton]
 Well, perhaps these questions will enlighten you... Walks Over To The Chalk Board And Turns It Over. On it is written] ANIMALS SHOULD BE SEEN AND NOT HEARD. Who is responsible for this? I'm waiting for answer... Very well, that will be all for today... You heard me, class dismissed!!!
All Students Exit Except Elphaba & Nessarose. Dillamond Has His Back Turned To Her.
[HAMILTON] You go on ahead, Nessa.
Nessarose Exits.
[HAMILTON] Reading The Board Aloud. "Animals should be seen and not heard..."
[Hamilton]
 Oh, Miss Elphaba, don't worry about me, go along and enjoy your friends.
[HAMILTON] Oh that's alright, I have no friends. Would you like to share my lunch?
[Hamilton]
 Oh, thank you! How kind.
She Pulls Out A Candy Bar And Unwraps It. He Takes The Paper and Begins To Eat It. He Sees The Board.
[Hamilton]
 I seem to have lost my appetite.
[HAMILTON] You shouldn't let statements like that bother you. I mean, I always do, but you shouldn't.
[Hamilton]
if it were only a matter of words on a chalkboard. But the things one hears these days... dreadful things! Miss Elphaba...

I'VE HEARD OF AN OX, A PROFESSOR FROM QUOX
NO LONG PERMITTED TO TEACH,
WHO HAS LOST ALL POWERS OF SPEECH.
AND AN OWL IN MUNCHKIN ROCK
A VICAR WITH A THRIVING FLOCK
FORBIDDEN TO PREACH
NOW HE ONLY CAN SCREECH!
ONLY RUMORS, BUT STILL, ENOUGH TO GIVE PAUSE
TO ANYONE WITH PAWS
SOMETHING BAD IS HAPPENING IN [Oz
[HAMILTON]
SOMETHING BAD?
HAPPENING IN [Oz?
[Hamilton]

UNDER THE SURFACE
BEHIND THE SCENES
SOMETHING BAAAAAH...
Sorry, bad...
[HAMILTON] Dr. Dillamond, are you alright? Shall I fetch you a glass of water?
[Hamilton]
 No, I don't know what came over me.
[HAMILTON] So, you're saying that there are animals that have, somehow, forgotten how to speak? But, how is that possible?
[Hamilton]
 Well, with so much pressure not to...
Morrible Enters.
[Morrible]
 I heard there was some sort of disturburance in class. Are you alright, Doctor? Oh, Miss Elphaba, you're still here! I thought you would have been on your way to my seminar by now.
[HAMILTON] Yes Madame, ordinarily I would be but...
[Morrible]
 But what? I do hope I have not misplaced my trust in you. Magic is a very demanderating mistress, and if one has ambitions of meeting the Wizard. I'm sure Doctor Dillamond sees my point.
Morrible Exits.
[HAMILTON] I'd better go. Doctor Dillamond, if something bad is happening to the Animals then someone has to tell the Wizard. That's why we have a Wizard!
SO NOTHING BAD
Both]
NOTHNG ALL THAT BAD
[Hamilton]

NOTHING TRULY BAAAAHHH...
Sorry... Bad.
[HAMILTON]
IT COULDN'T HAPPEN HERE,
IN [Oz...


[BURR]
 Here we are, sir! Shiz University!
[BURR]
 What? Already?
[BURR]
 Yes, sir.
[BURR]
 What a shame. Well, we'll see you soon, Avaric. Don't worry, I won't last longer at this school than I did at any of the others.
Avaric Exits.
[Angelica]
 Uh, miss Galinda, I know I'm just a munchkin, but munchkins have feelings too, and I've been trying to tell you mine, for you. But sometimes it seems like you don't even know I'm there.
[linda]

 That's not true, Biq.
[Angelica]
 It's LAFAYETE.
[linda]

 Biq, do you know who that is? That's Fiyero Tiggular, tha Winkie Prince whose reputation is so scandalacious!
LAFAYETE Looks Disgusted. Fiyero Walks Toward Them. Galinda Swishes Her Hair. Fiyero, Noticing Her Strange Behavior, Does The Same.
[linda]

 To Fiyero. Were you looking for something or someone?
[BURR]
 Uhhh yea... history... class? I don't know... somewhere?
[Angelica]
 History building is way over there my friend...
[linda]

 That class just ended!
[BURR]
 Oh! Perfect timing! So, uh, what does one do for fun around here?
[linda]

 Nothing really... until now...
[Angelica]
 We've been studying!
[BURR]
 Well, I see that once again the responsibility to corrupt my fellow students falls to me. Fortunately, I'm up for the task.


[BURR]

THE TROUBLE WITH SCHOOLS IS
THEY ALWAYS TRY TO TEACH THE WRONG LESSON
BELIEVE ME, I'VE BEEN KICKED OUT OF ENOUGH OF THEM TO KNOW!
THEY WANT YOU TO BECOME LESS CALLOW, LESS SHALLOW,
BUT I SAY WHY INVITE STRESS IN?
STOP STUDYING STRIFE
AND LEARN TO LIVE
THE UNEXAMINED LIFE...
DANCIN' THROUGH LIFE
SKIMMING THE SURFACE
GLIDING WHERE TURF IS SMOOTH
LIFE IS PAINLESS FOR THE BRAINLESS
THOSE WHO DON'T TRY, NEVER LOOK FOOLISH
DANCING THROUGH LIFE
NO NEED TO TOUGH IT
WHEN YOU CAN SLUFF IT OFF AS I DO
NOTHING MATTERS, BUT KNOWING NOTHING MATTERS
IT'S JUST LIFE, SO KEEP DANCING THROUGH
DANCING THROUGH LIFE
SWAYING AND SWEEPING
AND ALWAYS KEEPING COOL
LIFE IS FRAUGHTLESS
WHEN YOU'RE THOUGHTLESS
THOSE WHO DON'T TRY
NEVER LOOK FOOLISH
DANCING THROUGH LIFE
MINDLESS AND CARELESS
MAKE SURE YOU'RE WHERE LESS TROUBLE IS RIFE
WHOES ARE FLEETING
BLOWS ARE GLANCING
WHEN YOU'RE DANCING
THROUGH LIFE!
So! What's the most swankified place in town?
[linda]

 That would be the

Sounds perfect!
LET'S GO DOWN TO THE [OzDUST BALLROOM
WE'LL MEET THERE LATER TONIGHT
WE CAN DANCE 'TIL IT'S LIGHT
FIND THE PRETTIEST GIRL
GIVE HER A WHIRL!
RIGHT ON DOWN TO THE [OzDUST BALLROOM
COME ON FOLLOW ME!
YOU'LL BE HAPPY TO BE THERE
[Students]

DANCIN' THROUGH LIFE, DOWN AT THE [OzDUST (LIFE!)
[BURR]

IF ONLY BECAUSE DUST IS WHAT WE COME TO!
[Students]

NOTHIN' MATTERS, BUT KNOWING NOTHING MATTERS
IT'S JUST LIFE!!!
[BURR]

SO KEEP DANCING THROUGH...
[Angelica]
 Miss Galinda? I hope you'll save at least one dance for me. I'll be waiting right there, right by your side, waiting, all night.
[linda]

 Oh, how very kind, Biq.
[Angelica]
 ... LAFAYETE...
[linda]

 But, do you know what would be even kinder?
SEE THAT TRAGICALLY BEAUTIFUL GIRL?
THE ONE IN THE CHAIR?
IT SEEMS SO UNFAIR
WE SHOULD GO ON A SPREE
AND NOT SHE, GEE
I KNOW SOMEONE WOULD BE MY HERO
IF THAT SOMEONE WERE
TO GO INVITE HER!
[Angelica]
 Well, maybe I could invite her!
[linda]


OH, BIQ, REALLY?
YOU WOULD DO THAT FOR ME?
[Angelica]
 I would do anything for you, Miss Galinda. Walks Over To Nessarose.
Excuse me, Miss Nessarose? There's something I'd like to ask you...
[BURR]
 To Galinda. You're good.
[linda]

 I don't know what you mean. But I do happen to be free tonight, so...
[BURR]
 So, I'll be picking you up around eight?
[linda]

 After all...
NOW THAT WE'VE MET ONE ANOTHER,
Both]
IT'S CLEAR WE DESERVE EACHOTHER!
[linda]

 You're perfect!
[BURR]
 You're perfect!
[CAST]
SO WE'RE PERFECT TOGETHER
BORN TO BE FOREVER
DANCING THROUGH LIFE!!!
[HAMILTON] It's absurd! This silly, rich boy appears and everyone's off to worship him and some cultish social gathering!
[Angelica]
 Even me! I'm going! Isn't it wonderful? LAFAYETE was too shy to ask me at first, but once Galinda encouraged him...
[HAMILTON] Galinda?!
[Angelica]
 Don't you dare say another word against her! I'm about to have the first happy night of my life all thanks to Galinda!
FINALLY FOR THIS ONE NIGHT,
I'M ABOUT TO HAVE A FUN NIGHT
WITH THIS MUNCHKIN BOY GALINDA FOUND FOR ME
AND I ONLY WISH THERE WERE
SOMETHING I COULD DO FOR HER TO REPAY HER
ELPHABA SEE...
WE DESERVE EACHOTHER AND GALINDA HELPED IT COME TRUE
WE DESERVE EACHOTHER, ME AND LAFAYETE
Please, Elphaba, try to understand.
[HAMILTON] I do...
[linda]

 Now I must accessorize myself for Fiyero.
Shen Shen Pulls The Witch's Hat Out Of One Of Galinda's Hat Boxes.
Pfanee] Galinda, what in [Oz's name!?
[linda]

 Now, just pretend you didn't see that. My granny is always giving me the most hideodeous hats.
I'd give it away, but I don't hate anyone that much.
Shen Shen] Yes you do!
Pfanee] Give it to her! Just do it!
They All Stare At Elphaba. Galinda Walks Forward, Meeting Elphaba Half Way.
[HAMILTON] Galinda, listen, Nessa and I were talking about you just now...
[linda]

 And I was just talking about you! I thought you might want to wear this hat to the party tonight! Gives Her The Hat.
IT'S REALLY... UH... SHARP!
DON'T YOU THINK?
Y'KNOW BLACK, IS THIS YEAR'S PINK!
YOU DESERVE EACHOTHER,
THIS HAT AND YOU,
YOU'RE BOTH SO... SMART!
YOU DESERVE EACHOTHER, SO HERE!
OUT OF THE GOODNESS OF MY HEART!
Galinda Runs Off. Elphaba Laughs At The Sight Of The Hat. She Exits.. The Students Enter And Dance.
When This Is Done, LAFAYETE And Nessarose Appear, Awkwardly Holding Hands.
[Angelica]
 What's in the punch?
[Angelica]
 Lemons, and melons, and pears!
[Angelica]
 Oh my!
[Angelica]

LISTEN NESSA...
[Angelica]
 Yes?
[Angelica]

UH, NESSA...
I'VE GOT SOMETHING TO CONFESS A
REASON WHY, WELL, WHY I ASKED YOU HERE TONIGHT...
NOW, I KNOW IT ISN'T FAIR.
[Angelica]
 Oh, LAFAYETE, I know why.
[Angelica]
 You do?
[Angelica]

IT'S BECAUSE I'M IN THIS CHAIR, AND YOU FELT SORRY FOR ME...
WELL, ISN'T THAT RIGHT?
[Angelica]
 No... it's because... uh... because...
BECAUSE YOU ARE SO BEAUTIFUL!
[Angelica]
 Oh, LAFAYETE!
I THINK YOU'RE WONDERFUL!
AND WE DESERVE EACH OTHER, DON'T YOU SEE THIS IS OUR CHANCE?
WE DESERVE EACH OTHER, DON'T WE LAFAYETE?
[Angelica]
 You know what? Let's dance!
[Angelica]
 What?
[Angelica]

LET'S DANCE!
They Dance, As Well As The Others Around Them. Finally, Mme. Morrible Runs Up To Galinda.
[Morrible]
 Oh, Miss Upland?
[linda]

 Madame Morrible... What are you doing here?
[Morrible]
 I have something for you. She Hands Her A Small Wand.
[linda]

 Gasps. Madame... a training wand... How can I ever express my graditution?
[Morrible]
 Oh, don't thank me! This was your roommate's idea, not mine.
[linda]

 What? Elphaba?
[Morrible]
 Miss Elphaba requested that I include you in sorcery class. She insisted I tell you this very night or she would quit the seminar.
[linda]

 But... why?
[Morrible]
 I have no idea. My personal opinion is you do not have what it takes. I hope you'll prove me wrong... I doubt you will.
She Leaves. Fiyero Comes Up To Galinda.
[BURR]
 What is it?
[linda]

 I got what I wanted...
[BURR]
 Then what's the matter?
[linda]

 Nothing...
[BURR]
 Good. Let's dance...
They Begin To Dance As Elphaba Walks In. They Stop As All The Students Gasp And Make Comments About The Way She Is Dressed. People Then Start Laughing.
[BURR]
 Who in Ozis this?
[linda]

 My roommate... please, don't ... stare!
[BURR]
 How can you help it?
Elphaba Takes Off The Hat, Noticing The Comments. She Waits, Then Puts It Back On And Begins To Dance. She Is Alone. There Is No Music.
[BURR]
 Well I'll say this, she doesn't give a twig about what anyone else thinks.
[linda]

 Of course does, she just pretends not to... I feel awful...
[BURR]
 Why? It's not like it's your fault.
[linda]

 Excuse me... She Walks Over To Elphaba and Clears Her Throat. May I cut in?
Galinda Begins Dancing Just As Horribly. The Students Now Accept It, And Begin To Dance Again As The Music Starts.
All]
DANCING THROUGH LIFE, DOWN AT THE [OzDUST
IF ONLY BECAUSE DUST IS WHAT WE COME TO
AND THE STRANGE THING, YOUR LIFE COULD END UP CHANGING
WHILE YOU'RE DANCING THROUGH

[Scene 9 - Sharing Secrets]
Elphaba & Galinda Barge Into Their Suite... Galinda Is In Hysterics.
[linda]

 Your very first party ever?! Your very first party! Oh I know! Let's tell each other something we've never told anyone... I'll go first] Fiyero and I are going to be married (squeals).
[HAMILTON] Really? He's asked you already?
[linda]

 No, he doesn't know yet... Now, you tell me a secret.
[HAMILTON] Like what?
[linda]

 Like... Why do you always sleep with this funny, little, green bottle under your pillow? Grabs The Bottle.
[HAMILTON] Give that back.
[linda]

 C'mon, tell me. Tell me tell me!
[HAMILTON] It was my mother's! That's all...
Silence.
[linda]

 Hands Her The Bottle. It's not fair. I told you a really good one.
[HAMILTON] My father hates me.
[linda]

 Gasps.
[HAMILTON] No, that's not the secret. It's my fault...
[linda]

 What is?
[HAMILTON] ... that my sister is the way she is. . Pause. You see, when my mother was carrying Nessa, my father was worried that the new baby might come out...
Both] Green.
[HAMILTON] So he made my mother chew milk flowers, day and night. But that made Nessa come too soon, with her little legs all tangled. And my mother never woke up. None of which ever would have happened if not for me.
[linda]

 But that was the milkflowers fault, not yours. That may be your secret, Elphaba, but that doesn't make it true. She Oh look, it's tomorrow! Elphie... do you mind if I call you Elphie?
[HAMILTON] Well, it's a little perky.
[linda]

 And you can call me... Galinda. So... Elphie... now that we're friends, I've decided to make you my new project!
[HAMILTON] You really don't have to do that.
[linda]

 I know, that's what makes me so nice!

[linda]


WHENEVER I SEE SOMEONE LESS FORTUNATE THAN I

WE'RE GONNA MAKE YOU POPULAR!
WHEN I SEE DEPRESSING CREATURES
WITH UNPREPOSSESSING FEATURES,
I REMIND THEM ON THEIR OWN BEHALF
TO THINK OF
CELEBRATED HEADS OF STATE
OR ESPECIALLY GREAT COMMUNICATORS
DID THEY HAVE BRAINS OR KNOWLEDGE?
DON'T MAKE ME LAUGH!
THEY WERE POPULAR
PLEASE, IT'S ALL ABOUT POPULAR
IT'S NOT ABOUT APTITUDE
IT'S THE WAY YOU'RE VIEWED
SO IT'S VERY SHREWD TO BE
VERY VERY POPULAR
LIKE ME!
[HAMILTON] This is never going to work!
[linda]

 Oh Elphie, you mustn't think that way anymore! Your whole life is going to change... and all because of me. Okay, stand... I will turn your frock into a beautiful ball gown! Stand up... She Picks Up Her Wand And Waves It. Ball gown!!! Nothing Happens, So She Repeats. Ball gown!!! Still Nothing Happens. She Taps Her Wand On The Bed. Is this thing on?
[HAMILTON] Do you want me to try?
[linda]

 No, I've got it! She Throws The Wand Down. Oh, just wear the frock... it's pretty! Now,
I'll show you how to flip your hair] Flip flip. Or you could use your hand. Demonstrates.
Or, you can use your whole body. Falls onto bed. Squeals. Now, for the finishing touch.
Takes flower out of her hair, puts it into Elphaba's. Why, Miss Elphaba, look at you, you're beautiful. Hands her the mirror.
[HAMILTON] After Looking In The Mirror. I... I have to go.
She Runs Off.
[linda]

 You're Welcome! She Admires Herself In The Mirror.
AND THOUGH YOU PROTEST
YOUR DISINTEREST,
I KNOW CLANDESTINELY...
YOU'RE GONNA GRIN AND BEAR IT
YOUR NEW FOUND POPULARITY! (SQUEALS)
LA LA LA LA
YOU'LL BE POPULAR!
JUST NOT QUITE AS POPULAR
AS ME!!!

[HAMILTON] Flips her hair.. Flip Flip! What?
[BURR]
 Nothing, it's just... you've been "Galinda-fied". You don't have to do that , you know?
[Hamilton]
 Alright, take your seats, class! I have something to say, and very little time to say it. This is my last day here at Shiz I am no longer permitted to teach. I want to thank you for your sharing your enthusiasm, your essays, no matter how feebly structured, and even, on occasion, your lunch.
Mme. Morrible Rushes In.
[Morrible]
 Doctor Dillamond! I'm so dreadfully sorry.
[HAMILTON] Madame, we've got to do something.
[Hamilton]
 Miss Elphaba, they can take away my job, but I shall continue speaking out.
Scientist] Come on, goat...
To Men Begin To Carry Him Out Of The Room.
[Hamilton]
 They are not telling you the whole story! Remember that, class! Remember that.
He Is Gone.
[HAMILTON] Doctor Dillamond! After A Pause. Well, are you just going to sit here in silence?
[Morrible]
 Miss Elphaba, there is nothing we can do. Please take your seat.
Professor] Good afternoon, students!
[Morrible]
 Good afternoon.
Professor] Every day, with every tick of the Time Dragon Clock, in every corner of our great [Oz, one hears the silence of progress. For example] this is called a cage!
He Points To A Cage With A Cloth Draped Over It. He Pulls Off The Cloth, Revealing A Lion Cub Inside.
Professor] Now, we will be seeing more and more of them in the near future. This remarkable innovation is actually for the Animal's own good...
[HAMILTON] If this is for his own good, then why is he trembling?
Professor] He's just excited to be here, that's all. Hits the cage. Now, as I was saying, one of the benefits of caging a Lion cub while he's young is that he never, in fact, will learn how to speak.
[HAMILTON] What?
He Motions The Students Forward, Toward The Cage.
Professor] That's right! Come closer!
[HAMILTON] To Fiyero. Can you imagine a world where Animals are kept in cages and they never speak?
Professor] Now, he may seem a bit agitated but that's easily remedied.
[HAMILTON] What should I do?
[BURR]
 I don't know.
[HAMILTON] Well, somebody has to... Do something!!!
Sparks Begin To Fly Everywhere. All Students & The Professor Are Moving Uncontrollably Except Fiyero and Elphaba.
[BURR]
 What's happening?
[HAMILTON] I don't know I got mad...andd
[BURR]
 Alright just don't move! And don't get mad at me... He Grabs The Cage. Well are you coming?
She Runs With Him After He Snatches The Lion Cub.
[HAMILTON] Careful! Don't shake him!
[BURR]
 I'm not!
[HAMILTON] We can't just let him loose anywhere, you know. We have to find someplace safe...
[BURR]
 Don't you think that I realize that? You must think I'm really stupid or something!
[HAMILTON] No, not really stupid.
[BURR]
 Why is it that every time I see you you're causing some sort of commotion?
[HAMILTON] I don't cause commotions, I am one.
[BURR]
 That's for sure.
[HAMILTON] Oh! So you think I should just keep my mouth shut! Is that what you're saying?
[BURR]
 No, I'm...
[HAMILTON] Do you think I want to be this way? Do you think I want to care this much? Don't you know how much easier my life would be if I didn't?
[BURR]
 Do you ever let anyone else talk?
[HAMILTON] Oh, sorry... But can I just say one more thing? You could have just walked away back there.
[BURR]
 So?
[HAMILTON] So, no matter how shallow and self-absorbed you tend to be...
[BURR]
 Excuse me, there's no pretense here. I happen to be genuinely self-absorbed and deeply shallow.
[HAMILTON] No you're not. Or you wouldn't be so unhappy.
[BURR]
 Fine, if you don't want my help...
[HAMILTON] No, I do! Poor little thing, it's heart is trembling... I didn't mean for...
[BURR]
 What did you mean to do? Why was I the only one you didn't do it to?
[HAMILTON] Oh look, you're bleeding... it must have scratched you. Referring To A Cut On His Face.
[BURR]
 Yea... or maybe it scratched me. I better get to safety... I mean the cub... get the cub to safety. He Walks Off.
[HAMILTON] Fiyero...

[[HAMILTON]
Miss Elphaba, there you are!
[HAMILTON] Madame Morrible...
[Morrible]
 Oh Miss Elphaba, I finally heard back from the Wizard!
[HAMILTON] The Wizard?
[Morrible]
 Yes, he wishes to meet you!
[HAMILTON] He asked for me?
[Morrible]
 Yes! I know how devastated you were the other day for our poor Doctor Dillamond, but I can assure you my dear, as one door closes, another one opens. She Hands Her A Green Envelope.
[HAMILTON] Madame, I don't know what to say! How can I ever thank you? She Hugs Her.
[Morrible]
 Oh careful dear, you musn't get wet She Places The Umbrella Back Over Elphaba's Head. Oh, I know! She Waves Her Hands And The Sun Comes Out. Didn't I tell you? Weather is my specialty. [Oz-speed, my dear! Make me proud.
[HAMILTON] I will, I'll try.
Morrible Exits.

[HAMILTON]
AND THERE WE'LL FINALLY BE
THE WIZARD AND I...

Conductor] All aboard!
[linda]

 Remember, eye contact. And don't forget to tell him how wonderful he is, Wizards love that! And be yourself... well... within reason.
LAFAYETE Wheels Nessarose Onstage.
[Angelica]
 Elphaba, I'm so proud of you and I know father would be too. We're all proud, aren't we?
[HAMILTON] You'll be alright, won't you?
[linda]

 She'll be fine! Biq will take care of her, right?
[Angelica]
 ...It's LAFAYETE... I... I can't do this anymore.
He Exits.
[Angelica]
 LAFAYETE...
[linda]

 Nessa, maybe he's just not the right one... for you.
[Angelica]
 No, it's me that's not right. Elphaba, just go, I'll be fine.
She Wheels Herself Offstage.
[HAMILTON] Nessa, wait!
[linda]

 Let her go. She'll have to manage without you. We all will.
[HAMILTON] Please, you'll barely even notice I'm gone. Besides, you have Fiyero. Where is he, anyway? Not that I expected him to say goodbye to me. We barely know each other.
[linda]

 I don't know him either. He's distant, and moodified, and he's been thinking, which really worrries me. I never knew how much he card about that old goat.
Fiyero Enters.
[linda]

 Oh, there he is! Fiyero, over here dearest!
[BURR]
 He Hands Elphaba Flowers. Elphaba, I'm happy for you.
[linda]

 Yes, we are both so happy...
[BURR]
 Uh, listen, I've been thinking...
[HAMILTON] Yes, I've heard.
[BURR]
 About that Lion cub and... everything. I think about that day a lot.
[HAMILTON] Really? So do I.
[linda]

 Me too! Poor Doctor Dillamond. It makes one want to... uh...
take a stand. So I've been thinking of... uh... changing my name.
[BURR]
 Your name?
[linda]

 Well, yes! Since Doctor Dillamond had his own way of pronouncing my name,
in solidarity and to express my outrage, I will henceforward be known no longer as Galinda, but as simply, Glinda.
[BURR]
 Oh well, that's very admirable of you... Glinda. To Elphaba. Elphaba, good luck.
He Runs Off.
[Burr] There, see?
[HAMILTON] Galinda...
[Burr] It's Glinda now. Stupid idea, I don't even know what made me say it.
[HAMILTON] It doesn't matter what your name is, everyone loves you!
[Burr] I don't care! I want him. I don't even think he's perfect anymore and I still want him.
This must be what other people feel like. How do they bear it? They embrace.

[HAMILTON] Come with me.
[Burr] Where?
[HAMILTON] To the Emerald City.
[Burr] Really?
[Ozia]

ONE SHORT DAY, IN THE EMERALD CITY...
[Burr] I've always wanted to see the Emerald City!
[Ozia]

All]
DAY!!!

A Large Head Is Rolled Onstage... It Speaks To The Two... Voice Booming
[Hamilton]
I am [Oz, the great and terrible! Who are you and why do you seek me?
[Burr] Say something!
[HAMILTON] Uh... Elphaba Thropp your terribleness!
His Speaks Normally.
[Hamilton]
Oh? Is that you Elphaba? I didn't realize!
He Climbs Out Of The Head.
[Hamilton]
I hope I didn't startle you, it's so hard to make out peoples' faces all the way back there.
So, let's see... which is which? Elphaba! He grabs her hands. And you must be.
[Burr] Glinda. The Ga is silent.
Elphaba touches the Ozmask.
[Hamilton]
I know. It isn't much, is it? But people expect this sort of thing. You have to give people what they want.
The thing is, I hardly ever let people meet the real me, but this being special occasion.
[HAMILTON] I'm so happy to meet you.
[Hamilton]
Well, that's good. 'Cause that's what I love best] making people happy!
I AM A SENTIMENTAL MAN
WHO ALWAYS LONGED TO BE A FATHER
THAT'S WHY I DO THE BEST I CAN
TO TREAT EACH CITIZEN OF OzAS SON
OR DAUGHTER
SO ELPHABA I'D LIKE TO RAISE YOU HIGH
'CUZ I THINK EVERYONE DESERVES THE CHANCE TO FLY!
AND HELPING YOU WITH YOUR ASCENT
ALLOWS ME TO FEEL SO PARENTAL.
FOR I AM
A SENTIMENTAL MAN!
[HAMILTON] I'm here... we're here to alert you that something bad is happening...
[Hamilton]
Please, I'm the Wizard of [Oz. I already know why you've come.
Elphaba & [Burr] Oooo.
[Hamilton]
Of course, you must prove yourself...
[Burr] Prove yourself, prove yourself.
[HAMILTON] But how?
[Hamilton]
Oh, I don't know.
SOME SORT OF GESTURE
MOSTLY FOR SHOW
SOMETHING TO TEST YOUR ADEPTNESS..
I know! Madame, the book!
Morrible Enters.
[Burr] Madame Morrible...
[Hamilton]
I believe you're well acquainted with my new Press Secretary.
[HAMILTON] Press Secretary?
[Morrible]
 Oh, yes dearies, I've risen up in the world. You'll find that the Wizard is a very generous man.
If you do something for him, he'll do much for you.
[HAMILTON] What do yhou want me to do?
[Hamilton]
Well, this is my monkey servent, Chistery. He looks so longingly at the birds every morning....
[Morrible]
 So the Wizard was thinking, perhaps, a levitation spell...
[Burr] Noticing A Book In Morrible's Hands. Is that the Grimmerie?
[Morrible]
 Yes, the ancient book of spells and enchantments. Hands It To Elphaba.
[Burr] Whispers. Can I touch it?
Morrlbe] Whispers. No!
[HAMILTON] What funny writing...
[Morrible]
 Well it's a lost language. The lost language of spells.
[Hamilton]
It's kind of a recipe book for change.
[Morrible]
 Don't be discouraged if you can't decipherate it, dearie.
I, myself, can only read a spell or two, and that took years and years
[HAMILTON]
AHVEN, TATEY, AVEN TATEY AVEN...
[Hamilton]
She Continues Chanting. Oh, Chistery, what a experience you are about to have!
[HAMILTON] .................................. AH MAY AH TAY ATUM
[Hamilton]
SINCE ONCE I HAVE MY OWN DAY IN THE SKY...
[HAMILTON] AH MAY AH TAH TAY MAY TU SE SAY TA!
[Hamilton]
I KNOW EVERYONE DESERVES THE CHANCE TO FLY!
Chistery Screams & Begins To Twitch.
[HAMILTON] What happened? Is something wrong?
[Morrible]
 No just a transition, dearie.
[HAMILTON] No, stop you're hurting him!
[Hamilton]
She's actually done it!
Chistery Sprouts Wings. And Begins Running Around The Stage.
[HAMILTON] NO! Quick, how do I reverse it?
[Morrible]
 You can't!
[HAMILTON] What?!
[Morrible]
 You can't! Spells are irreversible! I knew she had the power, I told you!
[HAMILTON] You planned all this?
[Morrible]
 Well, you benefit too, dearie! You benefit, too.
[Hamilton]
And this is only the beginning! Look.
The Other Monkeys Begin To Grow Wings And Fly.
[Morrible]
 Won't they make perfect spies?
[HAMILTON] Spies?!
[Hamilton]
You're right, that's a harsh word... how about scouts? That's what they'll be really. They'll fly around [Oz! Report any subversive Animal activity.
[HAMILTON] You can't read this book at all! Can you? That's why you need enemies, and cages, and spies. You have no real power.
[Hamilton]
Exactly... that's why I need you. Don't you see? The world is your oyster, now! You have so many...opportunites. You both do.
[Burr] Thank you, your [Ozness.
Wizard]
SINCE ONCE I HAD MY OWN DAY IN THE SKY
I KNOW EVERYONE DESERVES THE CHANCE TO...
[HAMILTON] NO!
She Runs Off.
[Morrible]
 Elphaba!
[Burr] Elphie! I am so sorry, your Wizardship. I'll fetch her back! Elphie wait!
She Runs After Her.
[Hamilton]
We must get her back. She knows too much.
[Morrible]
 Don't worry! I will handle it.
He Gets Back In The Head. Speaking, Again, With A Powerful Voice.
[Hamilton]
Guards, guards! There is a fugitive loose in the palace! Find her, capture her, and bring her to me!
Guards] Yes your [Ozness!

[Burr] Elphie, wait! Where are you going?
[HAMILTON] Oh no! There are no more stairs! This might be the attic...
[Burr] Elphaba, listen to me...
[HAMILTON] I have to barricade the door! She Picks Up A Broom And Places It Over A Trap Door.
[Burr] Elphaba, why couldn't you have stayed calm for once instead of flying off the handle?
I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY
I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY NOW
I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY HOW YOU'VE HURT YOUR CAUSE FOREVER
I HOPE YOU THINK YOU'RE CLEVER
[HAMILTON]
I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY! I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY TOO
I HOPE YOU'RE PROUD HOW YOU WOULD GROVEL IN SUBMISSION
TO FEED YOUR OWN AMBISSION
Both]
SO THOUGH I CAN'T IMAGINE HOW
I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY
RIGHT NOW...
[Morrible]
 Citizens of [Oz, there is an enemy that must be found and captured! Believe nothing she says. She's evil. Responsible for the mutilation of these poor, innocent monkeys! Her green skin is but an outward manifestation of her twisted nature! This distortion... this repulsion... this... Wicked Witch!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[Burr] Don't be afraid...
[HAMILTON] I'm not... it's the Wizard who should be afraid... of me!
[Burr] Elphie, just say you're sorry before it's too late.
YOU CAN STILL BE WITH THE WIZARD
WHAT YOU'VE WORKED AND WAITED FOR
YOU CAN HAVE ALL YOU EVER WANTED...
[HAMILTON] I know...
BUT I DON'T WANT IT
NO, I CAN'T WANT IT
ANYMORE...
SOMETHING HAS CHANGED WITHIN ME
SOMETHING IS NOT THE SAME
I'M THROUGH WITH PLAYING BY THE RULES
OF SOMEONE ELSE'S GAME!
TOO LATE FOR SECOND GUESSING
TOO LATE TO GO BACK TO SLEEP
IT'S TIME TO TRUST MY INSTINCTS
CLOSE MY EYES...
AND LEAP
IT'S TIME TO TRY DEFYING GRAVITY
I THINK I'LL TRY DEFYING GRAVITY
AND YOU CAN'T PULL ME DOWN
[Burr]
CAN'T I MAKE YOU UNDERSTAND
YOU'RE HAVING DELUSIONS OF GRANDURE?
[HAMILTON]
I'M THROUHG EXCEPTING LIMITS
'CUZ SOMEONE SAYS THEY'RE SO
SOME THINGS I CANNOT CHANGE,
BUT 'TIL I TRY I'LL NEVER KNOW!
TOO LONG I'VE BEEN AFRAID OF
LOSING LOVE I GUESS I'D LOST
WELL IF THAT'S LOVE,
IT COMES AT MUCH TOO HIGH A COST!
I'D SOONER BUY DEFYING GRAVITY
KISS ME GOODBYE I'M DEFYING GRAVITY
AND YOU CAN'T PULL ME DOWN!
The Guards Bang On The Locked Door.
[Guard]
 Open this door, in the name of his supreme [Ozness!
[HAMILTON] Ah May Ah Tay Ah Tum Ditum...
[Burr]
That's what started all this in the first place... that hideous levitation spell! STOP!!!
[Burr] Well... Where are your wings? Maybe you're not as powerful as you think you are...
A Broomstick Floats Across The Room Towards Elphaba.
[HAMILTON] I told you, Glinda... I did it, I tell ya!
The Guards Bang On The Door Once Again.
[HAMILTON] Quick! Get on!
[Burr] What?
[HAMILTON] Come with me... think of what we could do... together.
UNLIMITED, TOGETHER WE'RE UNLIMITED
TOGETHER WE'LL BE THE GREATEST TEAM THERE'S EVER BEEN, GLINDA
DREAMS THE WAY WE PLANNED 'EM
[Burr]
IF WE WORK IN TANDEM
Both]
JUST YOU AND I DEFYING GRAVITY
WITH YOU AND I DEFYING GRAVITY
[HAMILTON]
THEY'LL NEVER BRING US DOWN.
Well, are you coming?
[Burr] Elphie, you're trembling... here, put this around you...
She Drapes A Black Cape Around Her.
I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY
NOW THAT YOU'RE CHOOSING THIS
[HAMILTON] You too.
I HOPE IT BRINGS YOU BLISS
Both]
I REALLY HOPE YOU GET IT
AND YOU DON'T LIVE TO REGRET IT
I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY IN THE END!
I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY...
MY FRIEND...
Elphaba Runs Off. The Guards Break Down The Door.
[Guard]
 There she is! Don't let her get away!
They Grab Hold Of Glinda.
[Burr]
What in [Oz?! Let go of me! Do you hear me? Let go!
[HAMILTON]
It's not her. She has nothing to do with. I'm the one you want. It's me. Hahahahaha. It's me! Up here! It's me!
She Rises Up Center Stage Holding Her Broom.
[HAMILTON]
SO IF YOU CARE TO FIND ME,
LOOK TO THE WESTERN SKY
AS SOMEONE TOLD ME LATELY,
EVERYONE DESERVES THE CHANCE TO FLY!
AND IF I'M FLYING SOLO,
AT LEAST I'M FLYING FREE!
TO THOSE WHO GROUND ME,
TAKE A MESSAGE BACK FROM ME!
TELL THEM HOW I AM DEFYING GRAVITY!!!
I'M FLYING HIGH DEFYING GRAVITY!!!
AND SOON I'LL MATCH THEM IN RENOWN
AND NOBODY
IN ALL OF [Oz...
NO WIZARD THAT THERE IS OR WAS
IS EVER GONNA BRING
ME DOWN!!!

FINALLY A DAY THAT'S TOTALLY WICKED WITCH FREE
All]
WE COULDN'T BE HAPPIER
THANK GOODNESS!
[Morrible]
 And thank goodness for you, Glinda, and your handsome swain, our new captain of the guard.
To Fiyero. Now you've been at the forefront of the hunt for the Wicked Witch, haven't you?
[BURR]
 Not really, but I don't like to think of her as a Wicked Witch.
[Morrible]
 Captain, how does it feel?
[BURR]
 Frustrating... but I became captain of the guard to find her, and I will keep searching!
[Morrible]
 No, being engaged!
[Ozia]
 Congratulotions!
[BURR]
 To Glinda - Confused. This is an engagement party?
[Burr] Surprised?
[BURR]
 Yes!
[Burr] Good, we hoped you'd be... the Wizard and I!
WE COULDN'T BE HAPPIER
RIGHT DEAR?
COULDN'T BE HAPPIER
RIGHT HERE
LOOK WHAT WE'VE GOT
A FAIRY TALE PLOT
OUR VERY OWN HAPPY ENDING
WHERE WE COULDN'T BE HAPPIER
TRUE DEAR?
COULDN'T BE HAPPIER
AND WE'RE HAPPY TO SHARE OUR ENDING VICARIOUSLY
WITH ALL OF YOU!
HE COULDN'T LOOK HANDSOMER
I COULDN'T BE HUMBLER
BECAUSE HAPPY IS WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN ALL YOUR DREAMS COME TRUE...
[Morrible]
 And Glinda, dear, we're happy for you! As Press Secretary,
I have striven to ensure that all of Ozknows the story of your braverism! How I vividly remember...
THE DAY YOU WERE FIRST SUMMONED
TO AN AUDIENCE WITH [Oz,
AND ALTHOUGH HE WOULD NOT TELL YOU WHY INITIALLY
WHEN YOU BOWED BEFORE HIS THROWN
HE DECREED YOU'D HENCE BE KNOWN
AS GLINDA THE GOOD
OFFICIALLY!
[BURR]
 That's not how you described it to me.
[Burr] Oh no, not exactly, but Whispers we'll talk about it later.
[Morrible]

THEN WITH A JEALOUS SQUEEE
THE WICKED WITCH BURST FROM CONCEALMENT
WHERE SHE HAD BEEN LURKING
SURREPTITIALLY!
Gasps From Among The Crowd.
[Ozian]
I HEAR SHE HAS AN EXTRA EYE THAT ALWAYS REMAINS AWAKE!
[Ozian]
I HEAR THAT SHE CAN SHED HER SKIN AS EASILY AS A SNAKE!
[Ozian]
I HEAR SOME REBEL ANIMALS ARE GIVING HER FOOD AND SHELTER!
[Ozian]
I HEAR HER SOUL IS SO UNCLEAN, PURE WATER CAN MELT HER!
[BURR]
 What?
[Ozia]

MELT HER! PLEASE SOMEBODY GO AND MELT HER!
[BURR]
 Do you hear that?! Water will melt her? People are so empty-headed they'll believe anything!
[Burr] Excuse me just a tick-tock!
Her And Fiyero Talk Aside.
[BURR]
 I can't just stand here grinning pretending to go along with all of this!
[Burr] Do you think I like to hear them say those awful things about her? I hate it!
[BURR]
 Then what are we doing here? Let's go, let's get out of here!
[Burr] We can't leave now, not when people are looking to us to raise their spirits.
[BURR]
 You can't leave, because you can't resist this. And that is the truth.
[Burr] Maybe I can't. Is that so wrong? Who could?
[BURR]
 You know who could. Who has.
[Burr] Fiyero, I miss her too, but we can't just stop living. No one has searched harder for her than you. But don't you see? She doesn't want to be found. We have to face it.
[BURR]
 You're right. I'm sorry, you're right. And if it's going tol make you happy, of course I'll marry you.
[Burr] But it'll make you happy too, right?
[BURR]
 You know me... I'm always happy. He Runs Off.
[Burr] Fiyero! Thanks plenty dearest! He's gone to fetch me a refreshment, he's so thoughtful that way!
THAT'S WHY I COULDN'T BE HAPPIER
NO, I COULDN'T BE HAPPIER
THOUGH IT IS I ADMIT, THE TINIEST BIT
UNLIKE I ANTICIPATED,
BUT I COULDN'T BE HAPPIER
SIMPLY COULDN'T BE HAPPIER...
Well, not simply...
'CUZ GETTING YOUR DREAMS, IT'S STRANGE BUT IT SEEMS
A LITTLE, WELL, COMPLICATED...
THERE'S A KIND OF A SORT OF COST
THERE'S A COUPLE OF THINGS GET LOST...
THERE ARE BRIDGES YOU CROSSED YOU DIDN'T KNOW YOU CROSSED UNTIL YOU'VE CROSSED!
AND IF THAT JOY THAT THRILL
DOESN'T THRILL LIKE YOU THINK IT WILL...
STILL... WITH THIS PERFECT FINALE
THE CHEERS AND THE BALLYHOO
WHO WOULDN'T BE HAPPIER?
SO I COULDN'T BE HAPPIER
BECAUSE HAPPY IS WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN ALL YOUR DREAMS COME TRUE...
WELL, ISN'T IT?
HAPPY IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOUR DREAMS COME...
TRUE!!!!
[Ozia]

WE LOVE YOU GLINDA IF WE MAY BE SO FRANK!
[Burr]
THANK GOODNESS!
[Ozia]

FOR ALL THIS JOY WE KNOW WHO WE'VE GOT TO THANK!
THANK GOODNESS!
THAT MEANS THE WIZARD, GLINDA...
[Burr]

[Ozia]
 THANK GOODNESS!!!
[Burr] TODAY!!!!
[Ozia]
 TODAY, THANK GOODNESS FOR TODAY!


[Angelica]
 Will there be anything else, Madame?
[Angelica]
 I've asked you to call me Nessarose, remember?
[Angelica]
 Yes, Madame. He Exits.
[Angelica]
 LAFAYETE...
Elphaba's Voice Is Heard Inside A Closet.
[HAMILTON] Well, it seems the beautiful only get more beautiful, Nessarose Screams while the green just get greener.
Nessarose Is Scared And Confused.
Elphaba Steps Out Of The Closet.
[HAMILTON] I'm sorry. Did I scare you? I seem to have that effect on people. It's good to see you.
[Angelica]
 What are you doing here?
[HAMILTON] Well, there's no place like home. I never thought I'd hear myself say this but I need father's help. I need him to stand with me.
[Angelica]
 That's impossible.
[HAMILTON] No, no it's not. Not if you ask him. You know he'll listen to you.
[Angelica]
 Father's dead.
[HAMILTON] What?
[Angelica]
 He's dead. I'm the governor... Well what did you expect? After he learned what you'd done,
how you'd disgraced u,s he died... of shame. Embarrassed to death.
[HAMILTON] Good, I'm glad. It's better that way.
[Angelica]
 That's a wicked thing to say.
[HAMILTON] No, it's true. Because now it's just us. You can help me and together we can...
[Angelica]
 Elphaba, shut up! First of all, I can't harbor a fugitive, I'm an un-elected official!
And why should I help you? You fly around [Oz, trying to rescue animals you've never even met,
and not once have you ever thought to use your powers to rescue me!
ALL OF MY LIFE, I'VE DEPENDED ON YOU
HOW DO YOU THINK THAT FEELS?
ALL OF MY LIFE I'VE DEPENDED ON YOU
AND THIS HIDEOUS CHAIR WITH WHEELS!
SCROUNGING FOR SCRAPS OF PITY TO PICK UP
AND LONGING TO KICK UP
MY HEELS...
[HAMILTON] Nessa, there isn't a spell for everything! The power is mysterious.
It's not like coddling up a pair of... She Pulls Out The Grimmerie From Her Bag. Wait.
[Angelica]
 What are you doing?
Elphaba Begins Chanting.
[Angelica]
 What is that? Ah! My shoes! It feels like... like they're on fire! What have you done to my shoes???
She Lifts Her Dress, Revealing The Ruby Slippers. Nessarose Stands, But Falls. Elphaba Gives Her A Hand.
[Angelica]
 No, don't help me. She Stands.
[HAMILTON] Oh, Nessa, at last...
I'VE DONE WHAT LONG AGO I SHOULD
AND FINALLY FROM THESE POWERS SOMETHING GOOD
FINALLY SOMETHING GOOD...
[Angelica]
 LAFAYETE! LAFAYETE! Come quickly!
[HAMILTON] LAFAYETE?
[Angelica]
 LAFAYETE! Come here at once!
[HAMILTON] No! Nessa, listen, nobody can know I'm here!
Nessarose Runs Behind The Closet As LAFAYETE Enters.
[Angelica]
 Yes, what is it, Madame?
[HAMILTON] LAFAYETE...
[Angelica]
 What are you doing here? You stay back!
[HAMILTON] LAFAYETE, it's just me, I'm not going to hurt you!
[Angelica]
 No! You're lying! That's all you ever do! You and your sister! She's as wicked as you are!
[HAMILTON] What are you talking about?
[Angelica]
 I'm talking about my life. The little that's left of it. I'm not free to leave Munchkinland, none of us are.
Ever since she took power, she's been stripping the Munchkins of our rights...
and we didn't have that many to begin with! And do you know why?
Nessarose Reveals Herself In The Chair.
[Angelica]
 To keep you here, with me. But none of that matters anymore. Look.
Nessarose Stands Up.
[Angelica]
 To Elphaba. You did this for her?
[Angelica]
 For both of us!
[Angelica]
 Nessa, this changes everything.
[Angelica]
 I know.
[Angelica]

LISTEN NESSA...
[Angelica]
 What?
[Angelica]

UH NESSA, SURELY NOW I'LL MATTER LESS TO YOU
AND YOU WON'T MIND MY LEAVING HERE TONIGHT...
[Angelica]
 Leaving?
[Angelica]
 Yes...
THAT BALL THAT'S BEING STAGED
ANNOUNCING GLINDA IS ENGAGED
[Angelica]
 Glinda?
[Angelica]

YES NESSA THAT'S RIGHT!
I'VE GOT TO GO APPEAL TO HER
EXPRESS THE WAY I FEEL TO HER
Oh, Nessa, I lost my heart to Glinda from the moment I first saw her. You know that.
[Angelica]
 Lost your heart? Well, we'll see about that...
[HAMILTON] Nessa, let him go...
[Angelica]

DID YOU THINK I'D LET YOU LEAVE ME HERE FLAT?
[Angelica]
 Don't come any closer!
YOU'RE GOING TO LOSE YOUR HEART TO ME, I TELL YOU!
IF I HAVE TO... I HAVE TO...
Sees The Grimmerie.
MAGIC SPELL YOU...
She Grabs The Book.
[Angelica]
 Ah... Tum... Tah... Tae...
Elphaba Reveals Herself.
[HAMILTON] Nessa, stop!
[Angelica]
 What is she doing?!
[HAMILTON] No, Nessa, you're pronouncing the words all wrong!
[HAMILTON] Nessa!
[Angelica]
 LAFAYETE! What is it?
[Angelica]
 Gasps. My heart feels like it's... shrinking.
[Angelica]
 Elphaba, do something!
[HAMILTON] I can't! You can't reverse a spell once it's been cast!
[Angelica]
 So what do we do?
LAFAYETE Falls Into Nessa's Empty Wheel Chair. Elphaba Wheels Him Behind The Closet.
[Angelica]
 Elphaba, do something!
[Angelica]
 This is all your fault! If you hadn't shown me that horrendible book.
[HAMILTON] I have to find another spell... it's the only thing that might work. She Goes Behind The Closet As Well.
[Angelica]
 Save him, please!
JUST SAVE HIM, MY POOR LAFAYETE, MY SWEET MY BRAVE,
DON'T LEAVE ME 'TIL MY SORRY LIFE HAS CEASED...
Elphaba Wheels The Chair Out, Which Is Not Facing The Audience And Is Seen Casting A Spell.
ALL ALONE AND LOVELESS HERE
JUST THE GIRL IN THE MIRROR
JUST HER AND ME! THE WICKED WITCH OF THE EAST!
WE DESERVE EACH OTHER...
[Angelica]
 Well... what about his heart?
[HAMILTON] It's all right. He won't need one now. I have to go. I have business to attend to in the Emerald City.
Nessa, I have done everything I could for you but it has never been enough and it never will be...
She Leaves.
[Angelica]
 Elphaba, wait! Elphaba!
LAFAYETE Wakes Up.
[Angelica]
 Where am I? What happened?
[Angelica]
 Nothing, LAFAYETE, you just fell asleep... and...
He Sits Up, Squeaking. He Is Made Of Tin. Nessarose Screams.
[Angelica]
 What is it, what's wrong?
[Angelica]
 No, it wasn't me it was her! I tried to stop her.
LAFAYETE Screams Uncontrollably And Runs Off.
[Angelica]
 LAFAYETE, please listen! It was Elphaba! LAFAYETE! It was Elphaba!!!

[Hamilton]
[HAMILTON] Well you have, you have harmed me.
[Hamilton]
I realize that, and I regret it. Elphaba...
[HAMILTON] There you are! I'm setting those monkeys free! And don't try to interfere, or call the guards...
[Hamilton]
I'm not calling anyone. The truth is I'm glad to see you again. It gets pretty lonely around here. And I know you must get lonely too.
[HAMILTON] You don't know the first thing about me.
[Hamilton]
Oh, but I do. I do know you. I can't explain it exactly. You know what I mean? Elphaba, you've been so strong through all of this, aren't you tired of being the strong one? Wouldn't you like someone to take care of you? He Hands Her Back The Broom. Please, help me start again.
[HAMILTON] Don't you think I wish I could? That I could go back to the time when I believed you really were wonderful? The Wonderful Wizard of [Oz? Nobody believed in you more than I did.
[Hamilton]
Oh, my dear child...
I NEVER ASKED FOR THIS OR PLANNED IT IN ADVANCE
I WAS MERELY BLOWN HERE BY THE WINDS OF CHANCE
I NEVER SAW MYSELF AS A SOLOMON OR SOCRATES
I KNEW WHO I WAS, ONE OF YOUR DIME A D[OzEN MEDIOCRATES
THEN SUDDENLY I'M HERE, RESPECTED, WORSHIPED EVEN
JUST BECAUSE THE FOLKS IN OzNEEDED SOMEONE TO BELIEVE IN
DOES IT SURPRISE YOU I GOT HOOKED AND ALL TOO SOON
WHAT CAN I SAY? I GOT CARRIED AWAY
AND NOT JUST BY BALLOON...
WONDERFUL
THEY CALLED ME WONDERFUL
SO I SAID, WONDERFUL, IF YOU INSIST
I WILL BE WONDERFUL
AND THEY SAID WONDERFUL
BELIEVE ME IT'S HARD TO RESIST
'CUZ IT FEELS WONDERFUL
THEY THINK I'M WONDERFUL
HEY LOOK WHO'S WONDERFUL
THIS CORN-FED HICK!
WHO SAID IT MIGHT BE KEEN
TO BUILD A TOWN OF GREEN
AND A WONDERFUL ROAD OF YELLOW BRICK!
See, I never had a family of my own since I was always traveling, and I guess I just wanted to give the citizens of Ozeverything.
[HAMILTON] So you lied to them?
[Hamilton]
Only verbally. Besides, they were the lies they wanted to hear. Elphaba, where I come from we believe all sorts of things that aren't true... we call it history!
A MAN'S CALLED A TRAITOR
OR LIBERATOR
A RICH MAN'S A THIEF
OR PHILANTHROPIST
IS ONE A CRUSADER
OR RUTHLESS INVADER
IT'S ALL IN THE LABEL WHICH IS ABLE TO PERSIST
THERE ARE PRECIOUS FEW AT EASE
WITH MORAL AMBIGUITIES
SO WE ACT AS THOUGH THEY DON'T EXIST...
THEY CALL ME WONDERFUL
SO I AM
INFACT, IT'S SO MUCH WHO I AM IT'S PART OF MY NAME!
AND WITH MY HELP YOU CAN BE THE SAME...
AT LONG, LONG LAST RECEIVE YOUR DUE
LONG OVERDUE
ELPHABA, THE MOST CELEBRATED
ARE THE REHABILITATED
THERE'LL SUCH A WHOOPDEE DOO!
A CELEBRATION THROUGHOUT [Oz,
THAT'S ALL TO DO WITH YOU!
WONDERFUL, THEY'LL CALL YOU WONDERFUL!
[HAMILTON]
THAT DOES SOUND WONDERFUL!
Wizard]
TRUST ME IT'S FUN!!!
Both]
WHEN YOU ARE WONDERFUL,
IT WOULD BE WONDERFUL!
WONDERFUL, WONDERFUL
Wizard]
ONE, TWO AND...
They Dance.
[HAMILTON]
I'LL ACCEPT YOUR PROPOSITION
[Hamilton]
Wonderful
[HAMILTON]
ON ONE CONDITION
[Hamilton]
Yes?
[HAMILTON] You set those Monkeys free.
[Hamilton]
Done.

[HAMILTON] Go! Fly! You're Free! Fly! Chistery, Chistery, you're free, isn't it wonderful?! Go, fly! She Makes Her Way To Another "Monkey" Covered By A Sheet.
[Hamilton]
No! No! Please!
She Pulls Off The Cover, Revealing Dr. Dillamond.
[HAMILTON] No! It can't be! Doctor Dillamond...
[Hamilton]
Elphaba, we just couldn't keep letting him speak out...
[HAMILTON] Doctor Dillamond, are you alright? Don't be afraid. It's me, Elphaba.
[Hamilton]
 Bahhhhh.
[HAMILTON] Doctor, don't you remember me?
[Hamilton]
 Bahhhhh.
[HAMILTON] Can't you speak?
[Hamilton]
 Bahhhhh.
[HAMILTON] No... We have nothing in common. I am nothing like you and I never will be and I will fight you until the day I die!!!
The Wizard Climbs Into The Head And Dr. Dillamond Runs Offstage.

[Hamilton]
Guards, guards!!!
Fiyero Runs In With His Men.
[Guard]
 Halt!
[BURR]
 Are you alright, your [Ozness?
[HAMILTON] Fiyero!
[BURR]
 I don't believe it...
[HAMILTON] Oh , Fiyero, thank God. I thought you were...
[BURR]
 Silence witch!!!
[Guard]
 There's a Goat on the lam, sir.
[BURR]
 Never mind all that. Fetch me some... some water.
[Guard]
 Water, sir?
[BURR]
 You heard me, as much as you can carry.
Guards] Yes, sir!
They March Off.
[HAMILTON] Fiyero...
[BURR]
 I said silence!
[Hamilton]
He Runs Out Of The Head. No! No!
[BURR]
 Don't make a sound, your [Ozness, unless you want all your guests to know the truth about the Wonderful Wizard of [Oz... Elphaba, I'll find Doctor Dillamond later, no get out of here.
[HAMILTON] Fiyero, you frightened me. I thought, I though you might have changed.
[BURR]
 I have... changed.
Glinda Enters.
[Burr] What's going on... Elphie? Oh, thank Ozyou're alive! Only you shouldn't have come. If anyone discoverates you ...
[BURR]
 Glinda, you'd better go.
[Burr] Fiyero, what are you...
[BURR]
 Please, just go back to the ball.
[Burr] Your [Ozness, he means no disrespectation. Please understand! You see, we all went to school together...
[BURR]
 Elphaba!
[Burr] Fiyero, have you misplaced your mind? What are you doing?
[BURR]
 I'm going with her.
[Burr] What? What are you saying? You mean all this time... the two of you... behind my back...
[HAMILTON] No, Glinda it wasn't like that!
[BURR]
 Actually, it was...but it wasn't...Elphaba, let's go... let's go!
They Run Off.
[Burr] Fine, go! You deserve each other...
The Wizard Holds A Small Bottle With A Green Liquid.
[Hamilton]
Here, have a swig of this, it dulls the pain.
[Burr] No, thank you.
Mme. Morrible Enters, Laughing.
[Morrible]
 Oh, is it true? Your betrothed has taken her into custody?
[Hamilton]
Our new captain of the guard had other plans.
[Morrible]
 You mean she hasn't been captured?
[Hamilton]
Quite the contrary. And considering how well she eluded us last time...
[Morrible]
 Well, we'll just flush her out and force her to show herself.
[Hamilton]
But how?
[Burr] Her sister
[Morrible]
 What? What did she say?
[Burr] Use her sister. Spread a rumor. Make her think her sister is in trouble and she will fly to her side... and you'll have her.
[Hamilton]
Exactly so.
[Burr] Now, if your [Ozness will excuse me I have a slight headache, I think I'll lie down.
She Walks Out.
[Morrible]
 Yes, well...a rumor won't do it. Elphaba's too smart for that.
[Hamilton]
Far too smart.
[Morrible]
 Perhaps, a change in the weather...

[Burr]
DON'T WISH, DON'T START
WISHING ONLY WOUNDS THE HEART...
THERE'S A GIRL I KNOW, HE LOVES HER SO...
I'M NOT THAT GIRL...

Only Elphaba & Fiyero Are On Stage, In The Woods
[HAMILTON]
KISS ME TOO FIERCELY, HOLD ME TOO TIGHT
I NEED HELP BELIEVING YOU'RE WITH ME TONIGHT
MY WILDEST DREAMINGS COULD NOT FORSEE
LYING BESIDE YOU WITH YOU WANTING ME
IF JUST FOR THIS MOMENT
AS LONG AS YOU'RE MINE
I'VE LOST ALL RESISTANCE
AND CROSSED SOME BORDERLINE
AND IF IT TURNS OUT
IT'S OVER TOO FAST
I'LL MAKE EVERY LAST MOMENT LAST
AS LONG AS YOU'RE MINE...
[BURR]

MAYBE I'M BRAINLESS, MAYBE I'M WISE,
BUT YOU'VE GOT ME SEEING THROUGH DIFFERENT EYES,
SOMEHOW I'VE FALLEN UNDER YOUR SPELL
AND SOMEHOW I'M FEELING
IT'S UP THAT I FELL
Both]
EVERY MOMENT, AS LONG AS YOU'RE MINE
I'LL WAKE UP MY BODY
AND MAKE UP FOR LOST TIME
[BURR]

SAY THERE'S NO FUTURE
FOR US AS A PAIR...
Both]
AND THOUGH I MAY KNOW,
I DON'T CARE
IF JUST FOR THIS MOMENT
AS LONG AS YOU'RE MINE
COME BE HOW YOU WANT TO
AND SEE HOW BRIGHT WE SHINE!
BORROW THE MOONLIGHT
UNTIL IT IS THROUGH
AND KNOW I'LL BE HERE HOLDING YOU...
AS LONG AS YOU'RE MINE...
[BURR]
 What is it?
[HAMILTON] It's just... for the first time... I feel... wicked.

[HAMILTON] I just wish...
[BURR]
 What?
[HAMILTON] I wish I could be beautiful... for you.
[BURR]
 Elphaba...
[HAMILTON] Don't tell me that I am, you don't need to lie to me.
[BURR]
 It's not lying! It's... uh... it's looking at things another way. Someday, you and Glinda will make up and we'll all...
[HAMILTON] Shh! Listen... Do you hear that? A Shriek Is Heard In The Distance. It sounds like somebody in pain.
[BURR]
 It's just the wind.
[HAMILTON] The Siren Is Heard Again. My sister's in danger.
[BURR]
 What? How do you know?
[HAMILTON] I don't know, I just do... Gasps.
[BURR]
 Elphaba what's wrong, what is it?
[HAMILTON] This! Don't you see it?
[BURR]
 What do you mean? What do you see?
[HAMILTON] It doesn't make any sense... It's a house but it's... it's flying through the sky? I have to go to Nessa!
[BURR]
 I'll come with you!
[HAMILTON] No, you mustn't, it's too dangerous!
[BURR]
 Listen to me, listen! My family has a castle in Kiamo Ko. Now, no one is ever there except for the sentries who watch over it. We've never lived there.
[HAMILTON] Where do you live?
[BURR]
 In the other castle... It's the perfect hiding place; tunnels, secret passageways. You'll be safe there.
[HAMILTON] We will see each other again, won't we?
[BURR]
 Elphaba, we are going to be together always. You can see houses flying through the sky, can't you see that?
They Embrace And Elphaba Runs Off.
Glinda Enters. There Is A House In The Background. The Edge OF The Yellow Brick Road Can Be Seen.
[Burr] That's right, you just take that one road, the whole time. Waves offstage. Oh, I hope they don't get lost. I'm so bad at giving directions. She sees the house, picks up flowers and lays them in front of the house. Oh, Nessa.
Elphaba Appears.
[HAMILTON] What a touching display of grief.
[Burr] I don't think we have anything further to say to one another.
[HAMILTON] I wanted something to remember her by, and all that is left were those shoes, and now that wretched little farm girl has walked off with them. So I'd appreciate some time, alone, to say goodbye to my sister.
Glinda Backs Away As Elphaba Walks Toward The House.
[HAMILTON] Nessa, please, please, please forgive me...
[Burr] Elphie... you mustn't blame yourself. It's dreadful, it is, to have a house fall on you, but accidents will happen.
[HAMILTON] You call this an accident?
[Burr] Yes! Well, maybe not an accident...
[HAMILTON] Well, what do you call it?
[Burr] Well... a regime change. Caused by a bizarre and unexpected twister of fate.
[HAMILTON] You think cyclones just appear out of the blue?
[Burr] I don't know, I never really...
[HAMILTON] No, of course you never! You're too busy telling everyone how wonderful everything is!
[Burr] I'm a public figure, now. People expect me to...
[HAMILTON] Lie?
[Burr] Be encouraging! And what exactly have you been doing besides riding around on that filthy, old thing?
[HAMILTON] Well, we can't all come and go by bubble. Who's invention was that, the Wizard's? Of course, even if it wasn't I'm sure he'd still take credit for it.
[Burr] Yes, well, a lot of us are taking things that don't belong to us, aren't we?
[HAMILTON] Now wait just a clock tick! I know it may be difficult for that blissful, blonde brain of yours to comprehend that someone like him could actually choose someone like me! But it's happened... it's real. And you can wave that ridiculous wand all you want, you can't change it! He never belonged to you, he doesn't love you, and he never did! He loves me!
Glinda Slaps Her.
[HAMILTON] Cackles. Feel better now?
[Burr] Yes, I do.
[HAMILTON] Good, so do I.
She Slaps Glinda. Glinda Then Twirls Her Wand Skillfully And Elphaba Arms Herself With Her Broom. They Charge At Each Other And Then Drop Their "Weapons" And Beat Each Other Senselessly. Glinda Takes Elphaba's Hat Off Her Head And Begins To Whack Her With It. The Guards Run In.
[Guard]
 Halt! In the name of the Wizard!
They Grab Elphaba.
[HAMILTON] Stop! Let me go!
[Burr] Let me go, I almost had her!
[Guard]
 Sorry it took us so long to get here, Miss.
[HAMILTON] I can't believe you would sink this low! To use my sister's death as a trap to capture me?!
[Burr] I never meant for this to happen! Elphie!
Fiyero Swings In On A Rope.
[BURR]
 Let the green girl go!
[Burr] Fiyero, how in [Oz?
[BURR]
 I said let her go! Or explain to all Ozhow the Wizard's guards watched while Glinda the Good was slain.
[Burr] Fiyero...
[BURR]
 I said, let her go.
The Guards Release Her.
[BURR]
 Elphaba, go, now.
[HAMILTON] No, not without you.
[Burr] Fiyero, please.
[BURR]
 Hush! Now! Go!
Elphaba Hesitates.
[Burr] Do it!
She Runs Off.
[Guard]
 Seize him!
[Burr] Wait, what?! What are you doing? Stop it! In the name of goodness, stop! Don't you see? He wasn't going to harm me, he just... he just... he loves her.
[BURR]
 Glinda, I'm so sorry!
[Guard]
 Take him up to that field there! Put him on one of those poles until he tells us where the witch went.
They Drag Him Offstage.
[Burr] No, don't hurt him! Please, don't hurt him! Fiyero!!!!
[HAMILTON] Fiyero!!!!
ELEKA NAHMEN NAHMEN ATUM ATUM ELEKA NAHMEN
ELEKA NAHMEN NAHMEN ATUM ATUM ELEKA NAHMEN
LET HIS FLESH NOT BE TORN LET HIS BLOOD LEAVE NO STAIN,
WILL THEY BEAT HIM, LET HIM FEEL NO PAIN...
LET HIS BONES NEVER BREAK AND HOWEVER THEY TRY TO DESTROY HIM,
LET HIM NEVER DIE, LET HIM NEVER DIE!
ELEKA NAHMEN NAHMEN ATUM ATUM ELEKA NAHMEN
ELEKA NAHMEN NAHMEN ATUM ATUM ELEKA... ELEKA
AH! WHAT GOOD IS THIS CHANTING?
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT I'M READING
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT TRICK I OUGHT TO TRY!
FIYERO WHERE ARE YOU?! ALREADY DEAD OR BLEEDING?
ONE MORE DISASTER I CAN ADD TO MY GENEROUS SUPPLY!
NO GOOD DEED GOES UNPUNISHED
NO ACT OF CHARITY GOES UNRESENTED
NO GOOD DEED GOES UNPUNISHED
THAT'S MY NEW CREED
MY ROAD OF GOOD INTENTIONS
LED WHERE SUCH ROADS ALWAYS LEAD
NO GOOD DEED
GOES UNPUNISHED!
NESSA...
DOCTOR DILLAMOND...
FIYERO...
FIYERO!!!
ONE QUESTION HAUNTS AND HURTS
TOO MUCH, TOO MUCH TO MENTION
WAS I REALLY SEEKING GOOD
OR JUST SEEKING ATTENTION?
IS THAT ALL GOOD DEEDS ARE WHEN LOOKED AT WITH AN ICE COLD EYE?
IF THAT'S ALL GOOD DEEDS ARE
MAYBE THAT'S THE REASON WHY
NO GOOD DEED GOES UNPUNISHED
ALL HELPFUL URGES SHOULD BE CIRCUMVENTED
NO GOOD DEED GOES UNPUNISHED
SURE, I MEANT WELL, WELL LOOK AT WHAT WELL MEANT DID!
ALRIGHT, ENOUGH, SO BE IT!
SO BE IT THEN...
LET ALL OF OzBE AGREED
I'M WICKED THROUGH AND THROUGH
SINCE I COULD NOT SUCCEED
FIYERO SAVING YOU
I PROMISE NO GOOD DEED WILL I ATTEMPT TO DO AGAIN
EVER AGAIN!
NO GOOD DEAD, WILL I DO
AGAIN!!!!!!!!

[Ozia]

GO! AND HUNT HER AND FIND HER AND KILL HER!
Vicious Woman] Good fortune, witch hunters!

[Ozia]

GO! AND HUNT HER AND FIND HER AND KILL HER!
Rabid Man] Kill the witch!
[Ozia]

WICKEDNESS MUST BE PUNISHED
EVIL EFFECTIVELY ELIMINATED
WICKEDNESS MUST BE PUNISHED
KILL THE WITCH!
[Angelica]
 And, this is more than just a service to the Wizard. I have a personal score to settle with Elph... with the witch! Crowd Cheers.
IT'S DUE TO HER I'M MADE OF TIN
HER SPELL MADE THIS OCCUR
SO FOR ONCE I'M GLAD I'M HEARTLESS
I'LL BE HEARTLESS KILLING HER!
And I am not the only one. Looks Offstage. Oh, come on, you! Come out and tell them what she did to you in class that day. How you were just a cub and she cubnapped you.
Lion] No!
[Angelica]

YOU SEE THE LION ALSO
HAS A GRIEVANCE TO REPAY (Lion Roars)
IF SHE'D LET HIM FIGHT HIS OWN BATTLES WHEN HE WAS YOUNG,
HE WOULDN'T BE A COWARD TODAY!

[Burr] No, no, that's not the way it happened! Madame, you've got to stop this, it's gone too far!
[Morrible]
 Oh, I think Elphaba can take care of herself.
[Burr] Madame, something's been troubling me about Nessarose and that cyclone.
[Morrible]
 Oh yes... well, I guess it was just her time.
[Burr] Was it? Or did you...
[Morrible]
 After A Pause. Now, you listen to me, Missy, you may have fooled the rest of Ozwith this "aren't I good" routine, but you know better. You've wanted this since the beginning... and now you're getting what you wanted. So just smile and wave and shut up! Good fortune, good fortune witch hunters!
Rapid Man] Kill her!
Vicious Woman] Kill the witch!
WICKEDNESS MUST BE PUNISHED
BRAVE WITCH HUNTERS I WOULD JOIN YOU IF I COULD
BECAUSE WICKEDNESS MUST BE PUNISHED...
PUNISHED... PUNISHED...
BUT GOOD!!!
[HAMILTON] Oh, for [Oz's sake, stop crying!!! I can't listen to it anymore! Oh, you want to see your Aunt Em and your Uncle What's-his-name again?! Then get those shoes off your feet!!! Little brat... takes a dead woman's shoes; must have been raised in a barn! Chistery! Oh, Chistery, there you are. Where are the others? Chistery motions away. Chistery, please... if you don't at least try to keep speaking you will never... She Sees Glinda. Go away.
[Burr] They're coming for you.
[HAMILTON] Go away!
[Burr] Let the little girl go, and that poor little dog... Dodo.
[Burr] I know you don't want to hear this, but someone has to say it... You are out of control! I mean, come on! They're just shoes, let it go! Elphaba, you can't go on like this.
[HAMILTON] I can do anything I want. I am the Wicked Witch of the West! Another monkey Brings Her A Letter. At last! What took you so long? She Reads It. What's this? Why are you bothering me with this? She Reads On.
[Burr] What is it? What's wrong? It's Fiyero, isn't it? Is he...
[HAMILTON] We've seen his face for the last time.
[Burr] Oh no!
[HAMILTON] You're right... It's time I surrender. Carries A Bucket.
[Burr] Elphie.... Elphie, what is it?
[HAMILTON] You can't be found here! You must go. Refers To A Corner
[Burr] No.
[HAMILTON] You must leave.
[Burr] No! Elphie, I'll tell them everything.
[HAMILTON] No! They'll only turn against you.
[Burr] I don't care!
[HAMILTON] I do! Promise me, promise me, you won't try to clear my name... promise.
[Burr] Alright... I promise. But I don't understand.
[HAMILTON]
I'M LIMITED
JUST LOOK AT ME, I'M LIMITED
AND JUST LOOK AT YOU, YOU CAN DO ALL I COULDN'T DO, GLINDA

[HAMILTON] Here. Go on. Take this. Hands Her The Grimmerie.
[Burr] Elphie... you know I can't read that... Elphie...
[HAMILTON] Well then, you'll have to learn
NOW IT'S UP TO YOU
FOR BOTH OF US
NOW IT'S UP TO YOU
[HAMILTON] You're the only friend I've ever had.
[Burr] And I've had so many friends... but only one that mattered.

[Burr]
I'VE HEARD IT SAID
THAT PEOPLE COME INTO OUR LIVES FOR A REASON
BRINGING SOMETHING WE MUST LEARN
AND WE ARE LED TO THOSE
WHO HELP US MOST TO GROW
IF WE LET THEM
AND WE HELP THEM IN RETURN
WELL, I DON'T KNOW IF I BELIEVE THAT'S TRUE
BUT I KNOW I'M WHO I AM TODAY
BECAUSE I KNEW YOU
LIKE A COMMIT PULLED FROM ORBIT,
AS IT PASSES A SUN
LIKE A STREAM THAT MEETS A BOULDER
HALF WAY THROUGH THE WOOD
WHO CAN SAY IF I'VE BEEN CHANGED FOR THE BETTER?
BUT, BECAUSE I KNEW YOU...
I HAVE BEEN CHANGED
FOR GOOD...
[HAMILTON]
IT WELL MAY BE,
THAT WE WILL NEVER MEET AGAIN
IN THIS LIFETIME
SO LET ME SAY BEFORE WE PART
SO MUCH OF ME
IS MADE OF WHAT I LEARNED FROM YOU
YOU'LL BE WITH ME
LIKE A HANDPRINT ON MY HEART...
AND NOW WHATEVER WAY OUR STORIES END
I KNOW YOU HAVE RE-WRITTEN MINE
BY BEING MY FRIEND...
LIKE A SHIP BLOWN FROM IT'S MOORING
BY A WIND OFF THE SEA
LIKE A SEA DROP BY A SKY BIRD
IN A DISTANT WOOD
WHO CAN SAY IF I'VE BEEN CHANGED FOR THE BETTER?
BUT BECAUSE I KNEW YOU
[Burr]
BECAUSE I KNEW YOU
Both]
I HAVE BEEN CHANGED...
FOR GOOD...
[HAMILTON]
AND JUST TO CLEAR THE AIR
I ASK FORGIVNESS FOR THE THINGS I'VE DONE
YOU BLAME ME FOR.
[Burr]
BUT THEN I GUESS, WE KNOW THERE'S BLAME TO SHARE
Both]
AND NONE OF IT SEEMS TO MATTER ANYMORE!
[Burr] LIKE A COMET PULLED FROM ORBIT AS IT PASSES A SUN...
[HAMILTON] LIKE A SHIP BLOWN FROM ITS MOORING BY A WIND OFF THE SEA
[Burr] LIKE A STREAM THAT MEETS A BOULDER
[HAMILTON] LIKE A SEA DROP BY A BIRD
[Burr] HALFWAY THROUGH THE WOOD
[HAMILTON] IN THE WOOD
[Burr]
WHO CAN SAY IF I'VE BEEN CHANGED FOR THE BETTER?
Both]
I DO BELIEVE I HAVE BEEN CHANGED FOR THE BETTER.
[Burr]
AND, BECAUSE I KNEW YOU
[HAMILTON]
BECAUSE I KNEW YOU
Both]
BECAUSE I KNEW YOU
I HAVE BEEN CHANGED
FOR GOOD...


[HAMILTON] You have to hide. No one can know you were here. Hide yourself!
Elphaba Drapes A Scrim Around The Stage
Offstage Chorus of Women]
AND GOODNESS KNOWS
THE WICKED'S LIVES ARE LONELY
GOODNESS KNOWS THE WICKED DIE ALONE...
LAFAYETE and Other Witch Hunters Run In. You Can See The Silhouette Of The Action Happening Behind The Scrim. Glinda Is Downstage Watching The Action Take Place.
The Mob Surrounds The Witch And She Melts With A Scream The Mob Leaves And Glinda Comes Out From Hiding. She Moves Near The Scrim.
[Burr] Elphie? Elphie? Chistery opens the scrim, where just Elphaba's hat and the green bottle remain. Glinda cries, and grabs the had, holding it against her.
Chistery] Handing Her The Bottle. Miss, Miss Glinda.
[Morrible]
 Well, I don't know why you're so despondiary, I thought it went quite well! They seem thrilled to shreds with their brains and their hearts, and this and that.... Glinda Enters. Oh, Miss Glinda! I thought you'd be out festivating.
[Burr] This was Elphaba's. Holding Out The Bottle.
[Hamilton]
What's that you say?
[Burr] It was a keepsake. It was her mother's. She told me so herself.
I've only seen a little, green bottle like this one other time. It was right here, in this very room. You offered me a drink from it.
Lover's Song Played In Background.
[Hamilton]
But... oh my Lord...
I AM A SENTIMENTAL MAN
WHO ALWAYS LONGED TO BE...
a father...
[Morrible]
 So that was it. That's why she had such powers! She was a child of both worlds!
[Hamilton]
He Cries.
[Burr] I want you to leave [Oz. I'll make the pronouncement myself]
that the strains of wizardship have been too much for you and you are taking an indefinite leave of absence! Did you hear what I said?!
[Hamilton]
Yes, your goodness.
[Burr] You'd better go get your balloon ready. Guards!
He Exits.
[Morrible]
 Glinda, dear, I know we've had our miniscule differentiations in the past...
[Burr] Guards! Madame, have you ever considered how you'd fare in captivity?
[Morrible]
 What?
[Burr] Articulated. Captivity... prison! Personally, I don't think you'll hold up very well.
My professional opinion is that you do not have what it takes. I hope you prove me wrong.
I doubt you will. Take her away!
[Morrible]
 No!!!!

[Ozia]

GOOD NEWS! SHE'S DEAD!
THE WITCH OF THE WEST IS DEAD!
THE WICKEDEST WITCH THERE EVER WAS
THE ENEMY OF ALL OF US, HERE IN [Oz,
IS DEAD!
GOOD NEWS
GOOD NEWS!!!
The Scarecrow (Fiyero) Walks On Stage. He Bends Down & Knocks On A Trap Door In The Floor.
[BURR]
 It worked!
He Opens The Door & Elphaba Climbs Out.
[HAMILTON] Fiyero! I thought you'd never get here.
She Touches His Straw Face.
[BURR]
 Go ahead, touch, I don't mind. Ah, you did the best you could. You saved my life.
[HAMILTON] You're still beautiful.
[BURR]
 You don't have to lie to me.
[HAMILTON] It's not lying... its looking at things another way.
[Ozia]

NO ONE MOURNS THE WICKED
NOW AT LAST SHE'S DEAD AND GONE!
NOW AT LAST THERE'S JOY THROUGHOUT THE LAND!
[Burr] Fellow [Ozians, friends, we have been through a frightening time. There will be other times
and other things that frighten us. But if you let me, I'd like to try to help. I'd like to try to be... Glinda the Good.
[Ozia]

GOOD NEWS!!
[BURR]
 It's time to go.
[HAMILTON] We can never come back to [Oz, can we?
[BURR]
 No.
[HAMILTON] I only wish...
[BURR]
 What?
[HAMILTON] Glinda could know that we're alive.
[BURR]
 She can't know, not if we want to be safe. No one can ever know.
[Ozia]

GOOD NEWS...
[BURR]
 Come...
[Burr]
WHO CAN SAY IF I'VE BEEN CHANGED FOR THE BETTER? BUT...
Elphaba & [Burr]
BECAUSE I KNEW YOU...
[Ozia]

NO ONE MOURNS THE WICKED...
[Burr]
BECAUSE I KNEW YOU...
Elphaba & [Burr]
I HAVE BEEN CHANGED...
Fiyero and Elphaba Leave Through The Clock
[Ozia]

NO ONE MOURNS THE WICKED!
WICKED...
WICKED!!!

That depends. Who's asking?

[HAMILTON]
Oh, well, sure, sir
I'm Alexander Hamilton, I'm at your service, sir
I have been looking for you

[BURR]
I'm getting nervous

[HAMILTON]
Sir...
I heard your name at Princeton. I was seeking an accelerated course of study when I got sort of out of sorts with a buddy of yours. I may have punched him. It's a blur, sir. He handles the financials?

[BURR]
You punched the bursar

[HAMILTON]
Yes!
I wanted to do what you did. Graduate in two, then join the revolution. He looked at me like I was stupid, I'm not stupid

So how'd you do it? How'd you graduate so fast?

[BURR]
It was my parents' dying wish before they passed

[HAMILTON]
You're an orphan. Of course! I'm an orphan
God, I wish there was a war!
Then we could prove that we're worth more
Than anyone bargained for...

[BURR]
Can I buy you a drink?

[HAMILTON]
That would be nice

[BURR]
While we're talking, let me offer you some free advice
Talk less

[HAMILTON]
What?

[BURR]
Smile more

[HAMILTON]
Ha

[BURR]
Don't let them know what you're against or what you're for

[HAMILTON]
You can't be serious

[BURR]
You wanna get ahead?

[HAMILTON]
Yes

[BURR]
Fools who run their mouths off wind up dead

[LAURE]

Yo yo yo yo yo!
What time is it?

[LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
Show time!

[BURR]
...like I said...

[LAURE]

Show time! Show time! Yo!
I'm John Laurens in the place to be!
Two pints o' Sam Adams, but I'm workin' on three, uh!
Those redcoats don't want it with me!
Cuz I will pop chick-a pop these cops till I'm free!

[LAFAYETTE]
Oui oui, mon ami, je m'appelle Lafayette!
The Lancelot of the revolutionary set!
I came from afar just to say "Bonsoir!"
Tell the King "Casse toi!" Who's the best?
C'est moi!

[MULLIGAN]
Brrrah brraaah! I am Hercules Mulligan
Up in it, lovin' it, yes I heard ya mother said "Come again?"
Lock up ya daughters and horses, of course
It's hard to have intercourse over four sets of corsets...

[LAURE]

No more sex, pour me another brew, son!
Let's raise a couple more...

[LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
To the revolution!

[LAURE]

Well, if it ain't the prodigy of Princeton college!

[MULLIGAN]
Aaron Burr!

[LAURE]

Give us a verse, drop some knowledge!

[BURR]
Good luck with that] you're takin' a stand
You spit. I'm ‘a sit. We'll see where we land

[LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
Boooo!

[LAURE]

Burr, the revolution's imminent. What do you stall for?

[HAMILTON]
If you stand for nothing, Burr, what'll you fall for?
[LAURE]

Ooh
Who are you? [MULLIGAN]
Ooh

Who are you? [LAFAYETTE]
Ooh

Who are you?

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE/LAURE]

Ooh, who is this kid? What's he gonna do?

My Shot

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[HAMILTON]
I am not throwing away my shot!
I am not throwing away my shot!
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot!
I'm ‘a get a scholarship to King's College
I prob'ly shouldn't brag, but dag, I amaze and astonish
The problem is I got a lot of brains but no polish
I gotta holler just to be heard
With every word, I drop knowledge!
I'm a diamond in the rough, a shiny piece of coal
Tryin' to reach my goal. My power of speech] unimpeachable
Only nineteen but my mind is older
These New York City streets get colder, I shoulder
Ev'ry burden, ev'ry disadvantage
I have learned to manage, I don't have a gun to brandish
I walk these streets famished
The plan is to fan this spark into a flame
But damn, it's getting dark, so let me spell out the name
I am the-

[HAMILTON/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN/LAURE]

A-L-E-X-A-N-D
E-R-we are-meant to be...

[HAMILTON]
A colony that runs independently
Meanwhile, Britain keeps shittin' on us endlessly
Essentially, they tax us relentlessly
Then King George turns around, runs a spending spree
He ain't ever gonna set his descendants free
So there will be a revolution in this century
Enter me!

[LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN/LAURE]

(He says in parentheses)

[HAMILTON]
Don't be shocked when your hist'ry book mentions me
I will lay down my life if it sets us free
Eventually, you'll see my ascendancy
[HAMILTON]
And I am not throwing away
My shot
I am not throwing away
My shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot
[LAURE]

My shot!

My shot!

And I'm not throwing away my shot.

[HAMILTON/MULLIGAN/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE]
I am not throwing away my shot
I am not throwing away my shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot
It's time to take a shot!

[LAFAYETTE]
I dream of life without a monarchy
The unrest in France will lead to ‘onarchy?
‘Onarchy? How you say, how you say, ‘anarchy?'
When I fight, I make the other side panicky
With my-

[HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
Shot!

[MULLIGAN]
Yo, I'm a tailor's apprentice
And I got y'all knuckleheads in loco parentis
I'm joining the rebellion cuz I know it's my chance
To socially advance, instead of sewin' some pants!
I'm gonna take a-

[HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
Shot!

[LAURE]

But we'll never be truly free
Until those in bondage have the same rights as you and me
You and I. Do or die. Wait till I sally in
On a stallion with the first black battalion
Have another-

[HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
Shot!

[BURR]
Geniuses, lower your voices
You keep out of trouble and you double your choices
I'm with you, but the situation is fraught
You've got to be carefully taught]
If you talk, you're gonna get shot!

[HAMILTON]
Burr, check what we got
Mister Lafayette, hard rock like Lancelot
I think your pants look hot
Laurens, I like you a lot
Let's hatch a plot blacker than the kettle callin' the pot...
What are the odds the gods would put us all in one spot
Poppin' a squat on conventional wisdom, like it or not
A bunch of revolutionary manumission abolitionists?
Give me a position, show me where the ammunition is!

Oh, am I talkin' too loud?
Sometimes I get over excited, shoot off at the mouth
I never had a group of friends before
I promise that I'll make y'all proud

[LAURE]

Let's get this guy in front of a crowd

[HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN/ENSEMBLE]
I am not throwing away my shot
I am not throwing away my shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot

I am not throwing away my shot
I am not throwing away my shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot
[LAURE]

Ev'rybody sing]
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Hey!
Whoa!
Wooh!!
Whoa!
Ay, let ‘em hear ya!

Let's go!

I said shout it to the rooftops!

Tell your brother that he's gotta rise up
Tell your sister that she's gotta rise up

When are these colonies gonna rise up?
When are these colonies gonna rise up?
When are these colonies gonna rise up?
When are these colonies gonna rise up?

Rise up!
[COMPANY]
Whoa! Whoa!
Whoa!

Rise up!

[HAMILTON]
I imagine death so much it feels more like a memory
When's it gonna get me?
In my sleep? Seven feet ahead of me?
If I see it comin', do I run or do I let it be?
Is it like a beat without a melody?
See, I never thought I'd live past twenty
Where I come from some get half as many
Ask anybody why we livin' fast and we laugh, reach for a flask
We have to make this moment last, that's plenty

Scratch that
This is not a moment, it's the movement
Where all the hungriest brothers with
Something to prove went?
Foes oppose us, we take an honest stand
We roll like Moses, claimin' our promised land
And? If we win our independence?
‘Zat a guarantee of freedom for our descendants?
Or will the blood we shed begin an endless
Cycle of vengeance and death with no defendants?
I know the action in the street is excitin'
But Jesus, between all the bleedin' ‘n fightin'
I've been readin' ‘n writin'
We need to handle our financial situation
Are we a nation of states? What's the state of our nation?
I'm past patiently waitin'. I'm passionately
Smashin' every expectation
Every action's an act of creation!
I'm laughin' in the face of casualties and sorrow
For the first time, I'm thinkin' past tomorrow

[HAMILTON AND COMPANY]
And I am not throwing away my shot
I am not throwing away my shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country

Farmer Refuted

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[SEABURY]
Hear ye, hear ye! My name is Samuel Seabury
And I present "Free Thoughts on the
Proceedings of the Continental Congress!"
Heed not the rabble who scream revolution
They have not your interests at heart

[MULLIGAN]
Oh my God. Tear this dude apart

[SEABURY]
Chaos and bloodshed are not a solution
Don't let them lead you astray
This Congress does not speak for me

[BURR]
Let him be

[SEABURY]
They're playing a dangerous game
I pray the king shows you his mercy
For shame, for shame...
[HAMILTON]
Yo!
He'd have you all unravel at the
Sound of screams but the
Revolution is comin'
The have-nots are gonna
Win this
It's hard to listen to you with a straight face

Chaos and bloodshed already haunt us, honestly you shouldn't even talk. And what about Boston? Look at the cost, n' all that we've lost n' you talk
About Congress?!

My dog speaks more eloquently than thee!

But strangely, your mange is the same

Is he in Jersey?

For the revolution!
[SEABURY]
Heed not the rabble
Who scream
Revolution, they
Have not your
Interests
At heart

Chaos and bloodshed are
Not a
Solution. Don't
Let them lead you
Astray
This Congress does not
Speak for me

They're playing a dangerous game

I pray the king shows you his mercy

For shame

For shame,

[COMPANY]
For the revolution!

[SEABURY]
Heed-

[HAMILTON]
If you repeat yourself again I'm gonna-

[SEABURY/HAMILTON]
Scream-

[HAMILTON]
Honestly, look at me, please don't read!

[SEABURY]
Not your interests-

[HAMILTON]
Don't modulate the key then not debate with me!
Why should a tiny island across the sea regulate the price of tea?

[BURR]
Alexander, please!

[HAMILTON]
Burr, I'd rather be divisive than indecisive, drop the niceties

[ENSEMBLE]
Silence! A message from the King!

You'll Be Back

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[KING GEORGE]
You say
The price of my love's not a price that you're willing to pay
You cry
In your tea which you hurl in the sea when you see me go by
Why so sad?
Remember we made an arrangement when you went away
Now you're making me mad
Remember, despite our estrangement, I'm your man
You'll be back
Soon you'll see
You'll remember you belong to me
You'll be back
Time will tell
You'll remember that I served you well
Oceans rise
Empires fall
We have seen each other through it all
And when push
Comes to shove
I will send a fully armed battalion
To remind you of my love!

Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da
Da da dat dat da ya da!
Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da
Da da dat dat da...

You say our love is draining and you can't go on
You'll be the one complaining when I am gone...
And no, don't change the subject
Cuz you're my favorite subject
My sweet, submissive subject
My loyal, royal subject
Forever and ever and ever and ever and ever...

You'll be back
Like before
I will fight the fight and win the war
For your love
For your praise
And I'll love you till my dying days
When you're gone
I'll go mad
So don't throw away this thing we had

Cuz when push comes to shove
I will kill your friends and family to remind you of my love
Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da
Da da dat dat da ya da!
Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da
Da da dat-
Everybody!

[ENSEMBLE]
Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da
Da da dat dat da ya da!
Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da da da da

We gotta make an all out stand
Ayo, I'm gonna need a right-hand man.
ENSEMBLE
What?

What?

Buck, buck, buck, buck, buck!

Buck, buck, buck, buck, buck!

[WASHINGTON]
Check it-
Can I be real a second?
For just a millisecond?
Let down my guard and tell the people how I feel a second?
Now I'm the model of a modern major general
The venerated Virginian veteran whose men are all
Lining up, to put me up on a pedestal
Writin' letters to relatives
Embellishin' my elegance and eloquence
But the elephant is in the room
The truth is in ya face when ya hear the British cannons go...

[ENSEMBLE]
Boom!

[WASHINGTON]
Any hope of success is fleeting
How can I keep leading when the people I'm
Leading keep retreating?
We put a stop to the bleeding as the British take Brooklyn
Knight takes rook, but look
[WASHINGTON]
We are outgunned

Outmanned

Outnumbered
Outplanned

We gotta make an all out stand
Ayo, I'm gonna need a right-hand man

Incoming!

Buck, buck, buck, buck, buck!

Buck, buck, buck, buck, buck!

[MULLIGAN]

Let's take a stand with the stamina God has granted us
Hamilton won't abandon ship
Yo, let's steal their cannons-
[MULLIGAN]
Shh-boom! [COMPANY]

Goes the cannon, watch the blood and the shit spray and...

[COMPANY]
Boom!

Goes the cannon, we're abandonin' Kips Bay and...

[COMPANY]
Boom!

[WASHINGTON]
There's another ship and...

[COMPANY]
Boom!

[WASHINGTON]
We just lost the southern tip and...

[COMPANY]
Boom!

[WASHINGTON]
We gotta run to Harlem quick, we can't afford another slip
Guns and horses giddyup
I decide to divvy up
My forces, they're skittish as the British cut the city up
This close to giving up, facing mad scrutiny
I scream in the face of this mass mutiny]
Are these the men with which I am to defend America?
We ride at midnight, Manhattan in the distance
I cannot be everywhere at once, people
I'm in dire need of assistance...

[BURR]
Your excellency, sir!

[WASHINGTON]
Who are you?

[BURR]
Aaron Burr, Sir?
Permission to state my case?

[WASHINGTON]
As you were

[BURR]
Sir
I was a captain under General Montgomery
Until he caught a bullet in the neck in Quebec
And well, in summary
I think that I could be of some assistance
I admire how you keep firing on the British
From a distance

[WASHINGTON]
Huh

[BURR]
I have some questions, a couple of suggestions on how to fight instead of fleeing west

[WASHINGTON]
Yes?

[BURR]
Well-

[HAMILTON]
Your excellency, you wanted to see me?

[WASHINGTON]
Hamilton, come in, have you met Burr?

[HAMILTON]
Yes, sir

[HAMILTON AND BURR]
We keep meeting

[BURR]
As I was saying, sir, I look forward to seeing your strategy play out

[WASHINGTON]
Burr?

[BURR]
Sir?

[WASHINGTON]
Close the door on your way out

[HAMILTON]
Have I done something wrong, sir?

[WASHINGTON]
On the contrary
I called you here because our odds are beyond scary
Your reputation precedes you, but I have to laugh

[HAMILTON]
Sir?

[WASHINGTON]
Hamilton, how come no one can get you on their staff?

[HAMILTON]
Sir!

[WASHINGTON]
Don't get me wrong, you're a young man, of great renown
I know you stole British cannons when we were still downtown
Nathaniel Green and Henry Knox wanted to hire you...

[HAMILTON]
To be their Secretary? I don't think so

[WASHINGTON]
Why're you upset?

[HAMILTON]
I'm not-

[WASHINGTON]
It's alright, you want to fight, you've got a hunger
I was just like you when I was younger
Head full of fantasies of dyin' like a martyr?

[HAMILTON]
Yes

[WASHINGTON]
Dying is easy, young man. Living is harder

[HAMILTON]
Why are you telling me this?

[WASHINGTON]
I'm being honest
I'm working with a third of what our Congress has promised
We are a powder keg about to explode
I need someone like you to lighten the load. So?

[COMPANY (EXCEPT HAMILTON)]
I am not throwin' away my shot!
I am not throwin' away my shot!

Outnumbered, outplanned!

We'll need some spies on the inside
Some King's men who might let some things slide

I'll write to Congress and tell ‘em we need supplies, you rally the guys, master the element of surprise

I'll rise above my station, organize your information, ‘til we rise to the occasion of our new nation. Sir!

A Winter's Ball

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[BURR]
How does the bastard, orphan, son of a whore
Go on and on
Grow into more of a phenomenon?
Watch this obnoxious, arrogant, loudmouth bother
Be seated at the right hand of the father
Washington hires Hamilton right on sight
But Hamilton still wants to fight, not write
Now Hamilton's skill with a quill is undeniable
But what do we have in common? We're
Reliable with the

[ALL MEN]
Ladies!

[BURR]
There are so many to deflower!

[ALL MEN]
Ladies!

[BURR]
Looks! Proximity to power

[ALL MEN]
Ladies!

[BURR]
They delighted and distracted him
Martha Washington named her feral tomcat after him!

[HAMILTON]
That's true

[FULL COMPANY]
1780

[BURR]
A winter's ball
And the Schuyler sisters are the envy of all
Yo, if you can marry a sister, you're rich, son

[HAMILTON]
Is it a question of if, Burr, or which one?

Helpless

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[HAMILTON/BURR/LAURENS/ALL WOMEN (EXCEPT ELIZA)]
Hey hey hey hey

Ohh, I do I do I do I
Dooo! Hey!
Ohh, I do I do I do I
Dooo! Boy you got me [ALL WOMEN]
Hey hey hey hey
Hey hey hey hey
Hey hey hey hey
Hey hey hey

[ELIZA AND WOMEN]
Helpless!
Look into your eyes, and the sky's the limit I'm helpless!
Down for the count, and I'm drownin' in ‘em

[ELIZA]
I have never been the type to try and grab the spotlight
We were at a revel with some rebels on a hot night
Laughin' at my sister as she's dazzling the room
Then you walked in and my heart went "Boom!"
Tryin' to catch your eye from the side of the ballroom
Everybody's dancin' and the band's top volume

[ELIZA AND WOMEN]
Grind to the rhythm as we wine and dine
[ELIZA]
Grab my sister, and
Whisper, "Yo, this
One's mine."

My sister made her way across the room to you
And I got nervous, thinking "What's she gonna do?"
She grabbed you by the arm, I'm thinkin' "I'm through"
Then you look back at me and suddenly I'm
Helpless!

Oh, look at those eyes

Oh!
Yeah, I'm
Helpless, I know

I'm so into you
I am so into you

I know I'm down for the count
And I'm drownin' in ‘em.

[ALL WOMEN]
Oooh

Oooh

Oooh

Oooh

Helpless!

Look into your eyes
And the sky's the limit
I'm
Helpless!
Down for the count
And I'm drownin' in ‘em

I'm helpless!

Look into your eyes
And the sky's the limit I'm helpless!

Down for the count
And I'm drownin' in ‘em.

[HAMILTON]
Where are you taking me?

[ANGELICA]
I'm about to change your life

[HAMILTON]
Then by all means, lead the way

[ELIZA]
Elizabeth Schuyler. It's a pleasure to meet you

[HAMILTON]
Schuyler?

[ANGELICA]
My sister

[ELIZA]
Thank you for all your service

[HAMILTON]
If it takes fighting a war for us to meet, it will have been worth it

[ANGELICA]
I'll leave you to it

[ELIZA AND WOMEN]
One week later

[ELIZA]
I'm writin' a letter nightly
Now my life gets better, every letter that you write me
Laughin' at my sister, cuz she wants to form a harem

[ANGELICA]
I'm just sayin', if you really loved me, you would share him
[ELIZA]
Ha!
Two weeks later
In the living room stressin'
My father's stone-faced
While you're asking for his blessin'
I'm dying inside, as
You wine
And dine
And I'm tryin' not to cry
‘cause there's nothing that your mind can't do
My father makes his way across the room
To you
I panic for a second, thinking
"we're through"
But then he shakes your hand and says
"Be true"
And you turn back to me, smiling, and I'm
Helpless!

Helpless!
Hoo!

That boy is mine
That boy is mine!

Helpless! Helpless!
Down for the count
And I'm drownin' in em

[ALL WOMEN]
Stressin'

Blessin'

Look into your eyes
And the sky's the
Limit I'm
Helpless!
Down for the count
And I'm drownin' in em

[HAMILTON]
Eliza, I don't have a dollar to my name
An acre of land, a troop to command, a dollop of fame
All I have's my honor, a tolerance for pain
A couple of college credits and my top-notch brain
Insane, your family brings out a different side of me
Peggy confides in me, Angelica tried to take a bite of me
No stress, my love for you is never in doubt
We'll get a little place in Harlem and we'll figure it out
I've been livin' without a family since I was a child
My father left, my mother died, I grew up buckwild
But I'll never forget my mother's face, that was real
And long as I'm alive, Eliza, swear to God
You'll never feel so...

[HAMILTON]
Eliza...

I've never felt so-

My life is gon' be fine cuz Eliza's in it.
[ELIZA]
I do I do I do I do!

I do I do I do I do!

Hey, yeah, yeah!

I'm down for the count
I'm-

I look into your eyes, and the sky's the limit
I'm

...drownin' in ‘em. [ALL WOMEN]
Helpless!

Helpless!

Helpless!

Down for the count
And I'm drownin' in ‘em

Satisfied

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[LAURE]

Alright, alright. That's what I'm talkin' about!
Now everyone give it up for the maid of honor
Angelica Schuyler!
[ANGELICA]
A toast to the groom!

To the bride!

From your sister

Who is always by your side

To your union

And the hope that you provide

May you always...

Be satisfied.

[ALL MEN]
To the groom!
To the groom!
To the groom!

To the bride!
To the bride!

Angelica!
Angelica!
Angelica!

By your side!

To the union!
To the revolution!

You provide!
You provide!

[HAMILTON AND MEN]
Always-

Rewind-

[ALL WOMEN]
To the groom!

To the bride!

To the bride!

[ELIZA AND WOMEN]
Angelica!

By your side!

To the union!
To the revolution!

You provide!

Always-

Rewind-

[ANGELICA]
I remember that night, I just might
Regret that night for the rest of my days

I remember those soldier boys
Tripping over themselves to win our praise

I remember that dreamlike candlelight
Like a dream that you can't quite place

But Alexander, I'll never forget the first
Time I saw your face

I have never been the same
Intelligent eyes in a hunger-pang frame
And when you said "Hi," I forgot my dang name
Set my heart aflame, ev'ry part aflame

[FULL COMPANY]
This is not a game...

[HAMILTON]
You strike me as a woman who has never been satisfied

[ANGELICA]
I'm sure I don't know what you mean. You forget yourself

[HAMILTON]
You're like me. I'm never satisfied

[ANGELICA]
Is that right?

[HAMILTON]
I have never been satisfied

[ANGELICA]
My name is Angelica Schuyler

[HAMILTON]
Alexander Hamilton

[ANGELICA]
Where's your fam'ly from?

[HAMILTON]
Unimportant. There's a million things I haven't done but
Just you wait, just you wait...

[ANGELICA]
So so so-
So this is what it feels like to match wits
With someone at your level! What the hell is the catch? It's
The feeling of freedom, of seein' the light
It's Ben Franklin with a key and a kite! You see it, right?
The conversation lasted two minutes, maybe three minutes
Ev'rything we said in total agreement, it's
A dream and it's a bit of a dance
A bit of a posture, it's a bit of a stance. He's a
Bit of a flirt, but I'm ‘a give it a chance
I asked about his fam'ly, did you see his answer?
His hands started fidgeting, he looked askance?
He's penniless, he's flying by the seat of his pants

Handsome, boy, does he know it!
Peach fuzz, and he can't even grow it!
I wanna take him far away from this place
Then I turn and see my sister's face and she is...

[ELIZA]
Helpless...

[ANGELICA]
And I know she is...

[ELIZA]
Helpless...

[ANGELICA]
And her eyes are just...

[ELIZA]
Helpless...

[ANGELICA]
And I realize

[ANGELICA AND COMPANY]
Three fundamental truths at the exact same time...

[HAMILTON]
Where are you taking me?

[ANGELICA]
I'm about to change your life

[HAMILTON]
Then by all means, lead the way

[COMPANY (EXCEPT ANGELICA)]
Number one!

[ANGELICA]
I'm a girl in a world in which
My only job is to marry rich
My father has no sons so I'm the one
Who has to social climb for one
So I'm the oldest and the wittiest and the gossip in
New York City is insidious
Alexander is penniless
Ha! That doesn't mean I want him any less

[ELIZA]
Elizabeth Schuyler. It's a pleasure to meet you

[HAMILTON]
Schuyler?

[ANGELICA]
My sister

[COMPANY]
Number two!

[ANGELICA]
He's after me cuz I'm a Schuyler sister
That elevates his status, I'd
Have to be naïve to set that aside
Maybe that is why I introduce him to Eliza
Now that's his bride
Nice going, Angelica, he was right
You will never be satisfied

[ELIZA]
Thank you for all your service

[HAMILTON]
If it takes fighting a war for us to meet, it will have been worth it

[ANGELICA]
I'll leave you to it

[COMPANY]
Number three!

[ANGELICA]
I know my sister like I know my own mind
You will never find anyone as trusting or as kind
If I tell her that I love him she'd be silently resigned
He'd be mine
She would say, "I'm fine"

[ANGELICA AND COMPANY]
She'd be lying

[ANGELICA]
But when I fantasize at night
It's Alexander's eyes
As I romanticize what might
Have been if I hadn't sized him
Up so quickly
At least my dear Eliza's his wife;
At least I keep his eyes in my life...
[ANGELICA]
To the groom!

To the bride!

From your sister

Who is always by your side

To your union

And the hope that you provide

May you always

Be satisfied

And I know

She'll be happy as

His bride
And I know [ALL MEN (EXCEPT HAMILTON)]
To the groom!
To the groom!
To the groom!

To the bride!
To the bride!

Angelica!
Angelica!

By your side

To the union!
To the revolution!

You provide!
You provide!

[HAMILTON AND MEN]
Always-

Be satisfied

Be satisfied

[MEN]
Be satisfied
Be satisfied
Be satisfied
Be satisfied

Be satisfied
Be satisfied

Be satisfied
Be satisfied
Be satisfied
Be satisfied.

[ALL WOMEN (EXCEPT ELIZA)]
To the groom!

To the bride!

To the bride!

[ELIZA AND WOMEN]
Angelica!

By your side

To the union!
To the revolution!

You provide!

Always-

Be satisfied

[WOMEN]
Be satisfied

Be satisfied

Be satisfied.

[ANGELICA]
He will never be satisfied
I will never be satisfied

The Story of Tonight (Reprise)

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[LAURE]

I may not live to see our glory!

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE]
I may not live to see our glory!

[LAURE]

But I've seen wonders great and small

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE]
I've seen wonders great and small

[LAURE]

‘Cause if the tomcat can get married

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE]
If Alexander can get married-

[LAURE]

There's hope for our ass, after all!

[LAFAYETTE]
Raise a glass to freedom

[LAURENS/MULLIGAN]
Hey!
Something you will never see again!

[MULLIGAN]
No matter what she tells you

[LAFAYETTE]
Let's have another round tonight!

[LAURE]

Raise a glass to the four of us!

[LAFAYETTE/HAMILTON]
Ho!

[MULLIGAN]
To the newly not poor of us!

[LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/HAMILTON]
Woo!

[LAFAYETTE]
We'll tell the story of tonight

[LAURE]

Let's have another round-

[HAMILTON]
Well, if it isn't Aaron Burr

[BURR]
Sir!

[HAMILTON]
I didn't think that you would make it

[BURR]
To be sure

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE]
Burr!

[BURR]
I came to say congratulations

[MULLIGAN]
Spit a verse, Burr!

[BURR]
I see the whole gang is here

[LAFAYETTE]
You are the worst, Burr!

[HAMILTON]
Ignore them. Congrats to you, Lieutenant Colonel
I wish I had your command instead of manning George's journal

[BURR]
No, you don't

[HAMILTON]
Yes, I do

[BURR]
Now, be sensible
From what I hear, you've made yourself indispensable

[LAURE]

Well, well, I heard
You've got a special someone on the side, Burr

[HAMILTON]
Is that so?

[LAURE]

What are you tryin' to hide, Burr?

[BURR]
I should go

[HAMILTON]
No, these guys should go

[LAFAYETTE]
What?

[LAURE]

No!

[HAMILTON]
Leave us alone

[MULLIGAN]
Man...

[HAMILTON]
It's alright, Burr. I wish you'd brought this girl with you tonight, Burr

[BURR]
You're very kind, but I'm afraid it's unlawful, sir

[HAMILTON]
What do you mean?

[BURR]
She's married

[HAMILTON]
I see

[BURR]
She's married to a British officer

[HAMILTON]
Oh shit...

[BURR]
Congrats again, Alexander. Smile more
I'll see you on the other side of the war

[HAMILTON]
I will never understand you
If you love this woman, go get her! What are you waiting for?

[BURR]
I'll see you on the other side of the war

[HAMILTON]
I'll see you on the other side of the war

Wait For It

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[BURR]
Theodosia writes me a letter everyday
I'm keeping the bed warm while her husband is away
He's on the British side in Georgia
He's trying to keep the colonies in line
But he can keep all of Georgia
Theodosia, she's mine

Love doesn't discriminate
Between the sinners
And the saints
It takes and it takes and it takes
And we keep loving anyway
We laugh and we cry
And we break
And we make our mistakes
And if there's a reason I'm by her side
When so many have tried
Then I'm willing to wait for it
I'm willing to wait for it
[BURR]
My grandfather was a fire and brimstone preacher

But there are things that the
Homilies and hymns won't teach ya

My mother was a genius

My father commanded respect

When they died they left no instructions
Just a legacy to protect

[MEN]
Preacher, preacher
Preacher

Teach ya, teach ya, teach ya

Respect, respect

[WOMEN]
Genius


[LAURE]

GOOD NEWS, SHE'S DEAD!
THE WITCH OF THE WEST IS DEAD!
THE WICKEDEST WITCH THERE EVER WAS,
THE ENEMY OF ALL OF US HERE IN [,
IS DEAD! GOOD NEWS! GOOD NEWS!

[LAURE]

Look, it's Glinda!


[LAURE]

floats in on a giant bubble

[LAURE]

 It's good to see me, isn't it? ([Ozians Agree) No need to respond that was rhetorical. Fellow [Ozia]


[BURR]
LET US BE GLAD,
LET US BE GRATEFUL,
LET US REJOICIFY THAT GOODNESS COULD SUBDUE
THE WICKED WORKINGS OF YOU KNOW WHO!
ISN'T IT NICE TO KNOW
THAT GOOD WILL CONQUER EVIL?
THE TRUTH WE ALL BELIEVE'LL BY AND BY
OUTLIVE A LIE
FOR YOU AND...

[BURR]
Glinda! Exactly how dead is she?

[[Burr] Well, there has been much rumor and speculation... innuendo, outuendo...
but let me set the record straight. According to the Time Dragon Clock, the melting occurred at the 13th hour;
a direct result of a bucket of water thrown by a female child. Yes, the Wicked Witch of the West is dead!

[Ozian]
NO ONE MOURNS THE WICKED!

[Ozian]
NO ONE CRIES THEY WON'T RETURN!

[Ozia]

NO ONE LAYS A LILY ON THEIR GRAVE!
[Ozian Man]
THE GOOD MAN SCORNS THE WICKED!
Women]
THROUGH THEIR LIVES OUR CHILDREN LEARN!

[Ozia]

WHAT WE MISS WHEN WE MISBEHAVE!
[Burr]
AND GOODNESS KNOWS
THE WICKEDS' LIVES ARE LONELY
GOODNESS KNOWS
THE WICKED DIE ALONE
IT JUST SHOWS WHEN YOU'RE WICKED
YOU'RE LEFT ONLY
ON YOUR OWN
[Ozia]

YES, GOODNESS KNOWS
THE WICKEDS' LIVES ARE LONELY
GOODNESS KNOWS
THE WICKED CRY ALONE
NOTHING GROWS FOR THE WICKED
THEY REAP ONLY
WHAT THEY'VE SEWN
[Ozian] Glinda, why does wickedness happen?
[Burr] That's a good question; one that many people find confusifying. Are people born wicked,
or do they have wickedness thrust upon them? After all, she had a childhood,;
She had a father, who just happed to be the governor of munchlinkland Witch's Parents Enter.

[Frex]
 I'm off to the assembly, dear.
[Burr] She had a mother, as so many do...
[Frex]

HOW I HATE TO GO AND LEAVE YOU LONELY
Melena]
THAT'S ALRIGH IT'S ONLY JUST ONE NIGHT
[Frex]

BUT KNOW THAT YOU'RE HERE, IN MY HEART
WHILE I'M OUT OF YOUR SIGHT!
Frex Exits. A Lover Runs Into The Room.
[Burr] And like all families, they had their secrets.
Lover]
HAVE ANOTHER DRINK, MY DARK EYED BEAUTY,
I'VE GOT ONE MORE NIGHT LEFT HERE IN TOWN,
SO HAVE ANOTHER DRINK OF GREEN ELIXER
AND WE'LL HAVE OURSELVES A LITTLE MIXER
HAVE ANOTHER LITTLE SWALLOW LITTLE LADY,
AND FOLLOW ME DOWN
[Burr] And of course, from the moment she was born she was... well... different!
Midwife] AHHH!! It's coming!
[Frex]
 Now?
Midwife] The baby's coming!
[Frex]
 And how!

Midwife]
I SEE A NOSE!
[Frex]

I SEE A CURL!
Both]
IT'S A HEALTHY, PERFECT, LOVELY LITTLE...
(They Scream)
Melena] What is it? What's wrong?
Midwife]
HOW CAN IT BE?
[Frex]

WHAT DOES IT MEAN?
Midwife]
IT'S ATTROCIOUS!
[Frex]

IT'S OBSCENE!
Both]
LIKE A FROGGY, FERNY CABBAGE,
THE BABY IS UNATURALLY
GREEN!!!
[Frex]
 Take it away... Take it away!!!!
[Burr] So you see, it couldn't have been easy!

Munchki]

NO ONE MOURNS THE WICKED!
NOW AT LAST, SHE'S DEAD AND GONE!
NOW AT LAST THERE'S JOY THROUGHOUT THE LAND!
AND GOODNESS KNOWS (GOODNESS KNOWS)
WE KNOW WHAT GOODNESS IS (OOOOHHHH)
GOODNESS KNOWS, THE WICKED DIE ALONE (SHE DIED ALONE)
WOE TO THOSE (WOE TO THOSE)
WHO SPURN WHAT GOODNESSES THEY ARE SHOWN!
NO ONE MOURNS THE WICKED (GOOD NEWS)
NO ONE MOURNS THE WICKED (GOOD NEWS)
NO ONE MOURNS... THE WICKED...
WICKED...
WICKED!!!!!
[Burr] Well, this has been fun! But as you can imagine I have much to attend to,
what with the Wizard's unexpected departure. So, if there are no further questions...
[Ozian] Glinda, is it true you were her friend?
[Ozians Gasp
[Burr] Well, I... you see... um... yes.
Louder Gasps
[Burr] Well, it depends on what you mean by "friend". She Motions Her Bubble Downward.
I did know her. That is, our paths did cross... at school. But you must understand, it was a long time ago and we were both very young.

Okay, let's get this over with. No, I'm not seasick, yes, I've always been green, no, I didn't chew grass as a child.
[Frex]
 Elphaba!
[HAMILTON] Oh, this is my younger sister, Nessarose. As you can see, she is a perfectly normal color.
[Frex]
 Elphaba, stop making a spectacle of yourself! I'm only sending you here for one reason...
[HAMILTON] Yes, I know, to look after Nessarose.
Frex Holds Out A Box.
[Frex]
 My precious little girl] a parting gift.
[Angelica]
 Now, father... He Pulls Silver Shoes From The Box. Jeweled shoes!
[Frex]
 As befits the future governor of Munchkinland. Elphaba, take care of your sister.
And try not to talk so much! He Kisses Nessarose And Exits.
[Angelica]
 Elphaba...
[HAMILTON] Well what could he have gotten me? I clash with everything!
Mme. Morrible Enters
[Morrible]
 Welcome, new students! I am Madame Morrible, headmistress here, at Shiz University.
And whether you're here to study logic, literature, or linguification,
I know I speak for my fellow faculty members when I say we have nothing but the highest hopes for some of you.
Now, regarding room assignments... Elphaba & Galinda Raise Their Hands.
She Notices Galinda First. Yes, is this regarding room assignments?
[linda]

 Oh, Madame, thank you for asking, but I've already been assigned a private suite...
Noticing Her Followers' Disappointment. But you can all come visit me whenever you want!
Shen Shen] How good of you!
Pfanee] You are so good!
[linda]

 No I'm not!
Both] Yes you are!
[linda]

 Now stop! Swishes Her Hair.
[Morrible]
 Do you have a question?

[linda]

 Yes, you see, I am Galinda Upland of the Upperuplands... I've applied to your sorcery seminar,
and indeed that is my sole purpose of attending Shiz; to study sorcery with you.
Perhaps you recall my essay, "Magic Wands, Need They Have A Point".
[Morrible]
 Yes... However, I do not teach my seminar every semester, unless, of course, somebody special were to come along.
[linda]

 Well, exactly!
[HAMILTON] We have not yet received our room assignments.
[Morrible]
 Yes, yes, of course! Oh, You must be Miss Nessarose, the governor's daughter.
What a tragically beautiful face you have! Sees Elphaba, snorts...And you must be.
[HAMILTON] I'm the other daughter. Elphaba. I'm beautifully tragic.
[Morrible]
 Yes, yes, I'm sure you're very bright.
[linda]

 Bright? She's phosphorescent.
[Morrible]
 I don't seem to have you on my list. Oh, well a slight gulch, but not to fret! We'll find someplace to put you.
[linda]

 Y'know, I don't even think she read my essay.
Shen Shen] That's so unfair!
[Angelica]
 You should say something!
[linda]

 Should I?
Pfanee] Do it!
[Morrible]
 Now, which one of you young ladies would like to volunteer to share with Miss Elphaba?
[linda]

 Madame Morrible...
[Morrible]
 Thank you dear. Oh, how very good of you!
[linda]

 What?
[Morrible]
 Miss Elphaba, you may share with Miss Galinda.
[linda]

 Huh?
[Morrible]
 The governor made his concern for your sister's well being quite clear.
So, I thought it would be best if she share my private compartment where I can assist her as needed...
[HAMILTON] But Madame, I've always looked after my sister.
[Morrible]
 Everyone, to your dormitories.
[HAMILTON] But Madame...
[HAMILTON] Let her go!!!
Nessarose's Wheelchair Is Torn From Morrible's Hands And Begins To Wheel Itself Back To Elphaba.
[Morrible]
 How did you do that?
[linda]

 How did she do that?
[Angelica]
 Elphaba!
[Morrible]
 You mean this has happened before?
[HAMILTON] Uh... Something just comes over me sometimes... I'm sorry, Madame.
[Morrible]
 What? Never apologize for talent! Talent is a gift! Have you ever considered a career in sorcery?
[HAMILTON] Sorcery?
[Morrible]
 I shall tutor you myself, and take no other students.
[linda]

 What?
All Students But Galinda Exit.
[Morrible]
 Oh, Miss Elphaba...
MANY YEARS I HAVE WAITED
FOR A GIFT LIKE YOURS TO APPEAR
WHY I PREDICT THE WIZARD COULD MAKE YOU HIS
MAGIC, GRAND VIZIER!
MY DEAR, MY DEAR,
I'LL WRITE AT ONCE TO THE WIZARD
TELL HIM OF YOU IN ADVANCE
WITH A TALENT LIKE YOURS, DEAR, THERE IS
A DEFIN-ISH CHANCE
IF YOU WORK AS YOU SHOULD
YOU'LL BE MAKING GOOD
[linda]

 Madame Morrible...
[Morrible]
 No, not now dearest. She Exits.
[Burr] This will just make me a better person. She simles.
She Runs Off.

[HAMILTON]
DID THAT REALLY JUST HAPPEN?
HAVE I ACTUALLY UNDERSTOOD?
THIS WEIRD QUIRK I'VE TRIED TO SURPRESS OR HIDE
IS A TALENT THAT COULD HELP ME MEET THE WIZARD
IF I MAKE GOOD
SO I'LL MAKE GOOD.
WHEN I MEET THE WIZARD,
ONCE I PROVE MY WORTH,
AND THEN I MEET THE WIZARD,
WHAT I'VE WAITED FOR SINCE
SINCE BIRTH!
AND WITH ALL HIS WIZARD WISDOM
BY MY LOOKS HE WON'T BE BLINDED
DO YOU THINK THE WIZARD IS DUMB?
OR LIKE MUNCHKINS SO SMALL-MINDED? NO!
HE'LL SAY TO ME "I SEE WHO YOU TRULY ARE,
A GIRL ON WHOM I CAN RELY"
AND THAT'S HOW WE'LL BEGIN,
THE WIZARD AND I
ONCE I'M WITH THE WIZARD,
MY WHOLE LIFE WILL CHANGE,
'CUZ ONCE YOU'RE WITH THE WIZARD
NO ONE THINKS YOU'RE STRANGE
NO FATHER IS NOT PROUD OF YOU,
NO SISTER ACTS ASHAMED,
AND ALL OF OzHAS TO LOVE YOU
WHEN BY THE WIZARD YOU'RE ACLAIMED
AND THIS GIFT OR THIS CURSE
THAT I HAVE INSIDE
MAYBE AT LAST I'LL KNOW WHY
WHEN WE ARE HAND IN HAND,
THE WIZARD AND I
AND ONE DAY HE'LL SAY TO ME, "ELPHABA,
A GIRL WHO IS SO SUPERIOR,
SHOULDN'T A GIRL WHO'S SO GOOD INSIDE
HAVE A MATCHING EXTERIOR?
AND SINCE FOLKS HERE TO AN OBSURED DEGREE
SEEM FIXATED ON YOUR VERDEGRIS
WOULD IT BE ALRIGHT BY YOU
IF I DEGREENIFY YOU?"
AND OF COURSE THAT'S NOT IMPORTANT TO ME
"ALRIGHT! WHY NOT?" I'LL REPLY
OH, WHAT A PAIR WE'LL BE
THE WIZARD AND I
YES, WHAT A PAIR WE'LL BE
THE WIZARD AND...
UNLIMITED, MY FUTURE IS UNLIMITED
AND I'VE JUST HAD A VISION ALMOST LIKE A PROPHECY
I KNOW
IT SOUNDS TRULY CRAZY
AND TRUE, THE VISION'S HAZY
BUT I SWEAR SOME DAY THERE'LL BE
A CELEBRATION THROUGHOUT [Oz
THAT'S ALL TO DO
WITH ME!
AND I'LL STAND THERE WITH THE WIZARD
FEELING THINGS I'VE NEVER FELT
AND THOUGH I'D NEVER SHOW IT
I'D BE SO HAPPY I COULD MELT!
AND SO IT WILL BE FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE
AND I'LL WANT NOTHING ELSE 'TILL I DIE
HELD IN SUCH HIGH ESTEEM!
WHEN PEOPLE SEE ME THEY WILL SCREAM
FOR HALF OF [Oz'S FAVORITE TEAM]
THE WIZARD...
AND I!!!!

WE DON'T MEAN TO SHOW A BIAS,
BUT GALINDA, YOU'RE A MARTAR!
[linda]

 Well...

[HAMILTON] Boo!
[linda]

 Ahh!
[HAMILTON] Hahahaha!

[Hamilton]
 Settle down, now! I have read your most recent essays. And I am amazed to report the progress!
Although, some of us still tend to favor form over content... Ms. Glinda.
[linda]

 It's GAlinda.
[Hamilton]
 Excuse me... Glinda.
[linda]

 I really don't see what the problem is. Every other professor seems to be able to pronounce my name.
[HAMILTON] Maybe pronouncing your precious name isn't the sole purpose of Doctor Dillamond's life. Maybe he's not like every other professor. Maybe some of us are different.
[linda]

 Oh! It seems the artichoke is steamed.
[Hamilton]
 Class, class! Miss Elphaba has a point! As you know, I am the sole Animal on the faculty. The token Goat, as it were. But it wasn't always this way. Oh, dear students, how I wish you could have seen it as it once was. Where you could walk down the halls and see an antelope explicating a sonnet, a snow leopard solving an equation, a wildebeast waxing philosophic. Don't you see, dear students, how our dear Ozis becoming less and less...looks at Elphaba... colorful. Now, who can tell me what sent these events into motion?
[HAMILTON] Raises hand From what I've heard, it all started with the great drought.
[Hamilton]
 Exactly. Food grew scarce, people grew hungrier and angrier. And the question became "Whom can we blame?" Can anyone tell me what is meant by the term "Scapegoat"? Elphaba Raises Hand. Someone besides Miss Elphaba? Ah yes, Miss Glinda...
[linda]

 It's GAlinda... with a GA. I don't see why you can't just teach us history instead of always harping on the past.
[Hamilton]
 Well, perhaps these questions will enlighten you... Walks Over To The Chalk Board And Turns It Over. On it is written] ANIMALS SHOULD BE SEEN AND NOT HEARD. Who is responsible for this? I'm waiting for answer... Very well, that will be all for today... You heard me, class dismissed!!!
All Students Exit Except Elphaba & Nessarose. Dillamond Has His Back Turned To Her.
[HAMILTON] You go on ahead, Nessa.
Nessarose Exits.
[HAMILTON] Reading The Board Aloud. "Animals should be seen and not heard..."
[Hamilton]
 Oh, Miss Elphaba, don't worry about me, go along and enjoy your friends.
[HAMILTON] Oh that's alright, I have no friends. Would you like to share my lunch?
[Hamilton]
 Oh, thank you! How kind.
She Pulls Out A Candy Bar And Unwraps It. He Takes The Paper and Begins To Eat It. He Sees The Board.
[Hamilton]
 I seem to have lost my appetite.
[HAMILTON] You shouldn't let statements like that bother you. I mean, I always do, but you shouldn't.
[Hamilton]
if it were only a matter of words on a chalkboard. But the things one hears these days... dreadful things! Miss Elphaba...

I'VE HEARD OF AN OX, A PROFESSOR FROM QUOX
NO LONG PERMITTED TO TEACH,
WHO HAS LOST ALL POWERS OF SPEECH.
AND AN OWL IN MUNCHKIN ROCK
A VICAR WITH A THRIVING FLOCK
FORBIDDEN TO PREACH
NOW HE ONLY CAN SCREECH!
ONLY RUMORS, BUT STILL, ENOUGH TO GIVE PAUSE
TO ANYONE WITH PAWS
SOMETHING BAD IS HAPPENING IN [Oz
[HAMILTON]
SOMETHING BAD?
HAPPENING IN [Oz?
[Hamilton]

UNDER THE SURFACE
BEHIND THE SCENES
SOMETHING BAAAAAH...
Sorry, bad...
[HAMILTON] Dr. Dillamond, are you alright? Shall I fetch you a glass of water?
[Hamilton]
 No, I don't know what came over me.
[HAMILTON] So, you're saying that there are animals that have, somehow, forgotten how to speak? But, how is that possible?
[Hamilton]
 Well, with so much pressure not to...
Morrible Enters.
[Morrible]
 I heard there was some sort of disturburance in class. Are you alright, Doctor? Oh, Miss Elphaba, you're still here! I thought you would have been on your way to my seminar by now.
[HAMILTON] Yes Madame, ordinarily I would be but...
[Morrible]
 But what? I do hope I have not misplaced my trust in you. Magic is a very demanderating mistress, and if one has ambitions of meeting the Wizard. I'm sure Doctor Dillamond sees my point.
Morrible Exits.
[HAMILTON] I'd better go. Doctor Dillamond, if something bad is happening to the Animals then someone has to tell the Wizard. That's why we have a Wizard!
SO NOTHING BAD
Both]
NOTHNG ALL THAT BAD
[Hamilton]

NOTHING TRULY BAAAAHHH...
Sorry... Bad.
[HAMILTON]
IT COULDN'T HAPPEN HERE,
IN [Oz...


[BURR]
 Here we are, sir! Shiz University!
[BURR]
 What? Already?
[BURR]
 Yes, sir.
[BURR]
 What a shame. Well, we'll see you soon, Avaric. Don't worry, I won't last longer at this school than I did at any of the others.
Avaric Exits.
[Angelica]
 Uh, miss Galinda, I know I'm just a munchkin, but munchkins have feelings too, and I've been trying to tell you mine, for you. But sometimes it seems like you don't even know I'm there.
[linda]

 That's not true, Biq.
[Angelica]
 It's LAFAYETE.
[linda]

 Biq, do you know who that is? That's Fiyero Tiggular, tha Winkie Prince whose reputation is so scandalacious!
LAFAYETE Looks Disgusted. Fiyero Walks Toward Them. Galinda Swishes Her Hair. Fiyero, Noticing Her Strange Behavior, Does The Same.
[linda]

 To Fiyero. Were you looking for something or someone?
[BURR]
 Uhhh yea... history... class? I don't know... somewhere?
[Angelica]
 History building is way over there my friend...
[linda]

 That class just ended!
[BURR]
 Oh! Perfect timing! So, uh, what does one do for fun around here?
[linda]

 Nothing really... until now...
[Angelica]
 We've been studying!
[BURR]
 Well, I see that once again the responsibility to corrupt my fellow students falls to me. Fortunately, I'm up for the task.


[BURR]

THE TROUBLE WITH SCHOOLS IS
THEY ALWAYS TRY TO TEACH THE WRONG LESSON
BELIEVE ME, I'VE BEEN KICKED OUT OF ENOUGH OF THEM TO KNOW!
THEY WANT YOU TO BECOME LESS CALLOW, LESS SHALLOW,
BUT I SAY WHY INVITE STRESS IN?
STOP STUDYING STRIFE
AND LEARN TO LIVE
THE UNEXAMINED LIFE...
DANCIN' THROUGH LIFE
SKIMMING THE SURFACE
GLIDING WHERE TURF IS SMOOTH
LIFE IS PAINLESS FOR THE BRAINLESS
THOSE WHO DON'T TRY, NEVER LOOK FOOLISH
DANCING THROUGH LIFE
NO NEED TO TOUGH IT
WHEN YOU CAN SLUFF IT OFF AS I DO
NOTHING MATTERS, BUT KNOWING NOTHING MATTERS
IT'S JUST LIFE, SO KEEP DANCING THROUGH
DANCING THROUGH LIFE
SWAYING AND SWEEPING
AND ALWAYS KEEPING COOL
LIFE IS FRAUGHTLESS
WHEN YOU'RE THOUGHTLESS
THOSE WHO DON'T TRY
NEVER LOOK FOOLISH
DANCING THROUGH LIFE
MINDLESS AND CARELESS
MAKE SURE YOU'RE WHERE LESS TROUBLE IS RIFE
WHOES ARE FLEETING
BLOWS ARE GLANCING
WHEN YOU'RE DANCING
THROUGH LIFE!
So! What's the most swankified place in town?
[linda]

 That would be the

Sounds perfect!
LET'S GO DOWN TO THE [OzDUST BALLROOM
WE'LL MEET THERE LATER TONIGHT
WE CAN DANCE 'TIL IT'S LIGHT
FIND THE PRETTIEST GIRL
GIVE HER A WHIRL!
RIGHT ON DOWN TO THE [OzDUST BALLROOM
COME ON FOLLOW ME!
YOU'LL BE HAPPY TO BE THERE
[Students]

DANCIN' THROUGH LIFE, DOWN AT THE [OzDUST (LIFE!)
[BURR]

IF ONLY BECAUSE DUST IS WHAT WE COME TO!
[Students]

NOTHIN' MATTERS, BUT KNOWING NOTHING MATTERS
IT'S JUST LIFE!!!
[BURR]

SO KEEP DANCING THROUGH...
[Angelica]
 Miss Galinda? I hope you'll save at least one dance for me. I'll be waiting right there, right by your side, waiting, all night.
[linda]

 Oh, how very kind, Biq.
[Angelica]
 ... LAFAYETE...
[linda]

 But, do you know what would be even kinder?
SEE THAT TRAGICALLY BEAUTIFUL GIRL?
THE ONE IN THE CHAIR?
IT SEEMS SO UNFAIR
WE SHOULD GO ON A SPREE
AND NOT SHE, GEE
I KNOW SOMEONE WOULD BE MY HERO
IF THAT SOMEONE WERE
TO GO INVITE HER!
[Angelica]
 Well, maybe I could invite her!
[linda]


OH, BIQ, REALLY?
YOU WOULD DO THAT FOR ME?
[Angelica]
 I would do anything for you, Miss Galinda. Walks Over To Nessarose.
Excuse me, Miss Nessarose? There's something I'd like to ask you...
[BURR]
 To Galinda. You're good.
[linda]

 I don't know what you mean. But I do happen to be free tonight, so...
[BURR]
 So, I'll be picking you up around eight?
[linda]

 After all...
NOW THAT WE'VE MET ONE ANOTHER,
Both]
IT'S CLEAR WE DESERVE EACHOTHER!
[linda]

 You're perfect!
[BURR]
 You're perfect!
[CAST]
SO WE'RE PERFECT TOGETHER
BORN TO BE FOREVER
DANCING THROUGH LIFE!!!
[HAMILTON] It's absurd! This silly, rich boy appears and everyone's off to worship him and some cultish social gathering!
[Angelica]
 Even me! I'm going! Isn't it wonderful? LAFAYETE was too shy to ask me at first, but once Galinda encouraged him...
[HAMILTON] Galinda?!
[Angelica]
 Don't you dare say another word against her! I'm about to have the first happy night of my life all thanks to Galinda!
FINALLY FOR THIS ONE NIGHT,
I'M ABOUT TO HAVE A FUN NIGHT
WITH THIS MUNCHKIN BOY GALINDA FOUND FOR ME
AND I ONLY WISH THERE WERE
SOMETHING I COULD DO FOR HER TO REPAY HER
ELPHABA SEE...
WE DESERVE EACHOTHER AND GALINDA HELPED IT COME TRUE
WE DESERVE EACHOTHER, ME AND LAFAYETE
Please, Elphaba, try to understand.
[HAMILTON] I do...
[linda]

 Now I must accessorize myself for Fiyero.
Shen Shen Pulls The Witch's Hat Out Of One Of Galinda's Hat Boxes.
Pfanee] Galinda, what in [Oz's name!?
[linda]

 Now, just pretend you didn't see that. My granny is always giving me the most hideodeous hats.
I'd give it away, but I don't hate anyone that much.
Shen Shen] Yes you do!
Pfanee] Give it to her! Just do it!
They All Stare At Elphaba. Galinda Walks Forward, Meeting Elphaba Half Way.
[HAMILTON] Galinda, listen, Nessa and I were talking about you just now...
[linda]

 And I was just talking about you! I thought you might want to wear this hat to the party tonight! Gives Her The Hat.
IT'S REALLY... UH... SHARP!
DON'T YOU THINK?
Y'KNOW BLACK, IS THIS YEAR'S PINK!
YOU DESERVE EACHOTHER,
THIS HAT AND YOU,
YOU'RE BOTH SO... SMART!
YOU DESERVE EACHOTHER, SO HERE!
OUT OF THE GOODNESS OF MY HEART!
Galinda Runs Off. Elphaba Laughs At The Sight Of The Hat. She Exits.. The Students Enter And Dance.
When This Is Done, LAFAYETE And Nessarose Appear, Awkwardly Holding Hands.
[Angelica]
 What's in the punch?
[Angelica]
 Lemons, and melons, and pears!
[Angelica]
 Oh my!
[Angelica]

LISTEN NESSA...
[Angelica]
 Yes?
[Angelica]

UH, NESSA...
I'VE GOT SOMETHING TO CONFESS A
REASON WHY, WELL, WHY I ASKED YOU HERE TONIGHT...
NOW, I KNOW IT ISN'T FAIR.
[Angelica]
 Oh, LAFAYETE, I know why.
[Angelica]
 You do?
[Angelica]

IT'S BECAUSE I'M IN THIS CHAIR, AND YOU FELT SORRY FOR ME...
WELL, ISN'T THAT RIGHT?
[Angelica]
 No... it's because... uh... because...
BECAUSE YOU ARE SO BEAUTIFUL!
[Angelica]
 Oh, LAFAYETE!
I THINK YOU'RE WONDERFUL!
AND WE DESERVE EACH OTHER, DON'T YOU SEE THIS IS OUR CHANCE?
WE DESERVE EACH OTHER, DON'T WE LAFAYETE?
[Angelica]
 You know what? Let's dance!
[Angelica]
 What?
[Angelica]

LET'S DANCE!
They Dance, As Well As The Others Around Them. Finally, Mme. Morrible Runs Up To Galinda.
[Morrible]
 Oh, Miss Upland?
[linda]

 Madame Morrible... What are you doing here?
[Morrible]
 I have something for you. She Hands Her A Small Wand.
[linda]

 Gasps. Madame... a training wand... How can I ever express my graditution?
[Morrible]
 Oh, don't thank me! This was your roommate's idea, not mine.
[linda]

 What? Elphaba?
[Morrible]
 Miss Elphaba requested that I include you in sorcery class. She insisted I tell you this very night or she would quit the seminar.
[linda]

 But... why?
[Morrible]
 I have no idea. My personal opinion is you do not have what it takes. I hope you'll prove me wrong... I doubt you will.
She Leaves. Fiyero Comes Up To Galinda.
[BURR]
 What is it?
[linda]

 I got what I wanted...
[BURR]
 Then what's the matter?
[linda]

 Nothing...
[BURR]
 Good. Let's dance...
They Begin To Dance As Elphaba Walks In. They Stop As All The Students Gasp And Make Comments About The Way She Is Dressed. People Then Start Laughing.
[BURR]
 Who in Ozis this?
[linda]

 My roommate... please, don't ... stare!
[BURR]
 How can you help it?
Elphaba Takes Off The Hat, Noticing The Comments. She Waits, Then Puts It Back On And Begins To Dance. She Is Alone. There Is No Music.
[BURR]
 Well I'll say this, she doesn't give a twig about what anyone else thinks.
[linda]

 Of course does, she just pretends not to... I feel awful...
[BURR]
 Why? It's not like it's your fault.
[linda]

 Excuse me... She Walks Over To Elphaba and Clears Her Throat. May I cut in?
Galinda Begins Dancing Just As Horribly. The Students Now Accept It, And Begin To Dance Again As The Music Starts.
All]
DANCING THROUGH LIFE, DOWN AT THE [OzDUST
IF ONLY BECAUSE DUST IS WHAT WE COME TO
AND THE STRANGE THING, YOUR LIFE COULD END UP CHANGING
WHILE YOU'RE DANCING THROUGH

[Scene 9 - Sharing Secrets]
Elphaba & Galinda Barge Into Their Suite... Galinda Is In Hysterics.
[linda]

 Your very first party ever?! Your very first party! Oh I know! Let's tell each other something we've never told anyone... I'll go first] Fiyero and I are going to be married (squeals).
[HAMILTON] Really? He's asked you already?
[linda]

 No, he doesn't know yet... Now, you tell me a secret.
[HAMILTON] Like what?
[linda]

 Like... Why do you always sleep with this funny, little, green bottle under your pillow? Grabs The Bottle.
[HAMILTON] Give that back.
[linda]

 C'mon, tell me. Tell me tell me!
[HAMILTON] It was my mother's! That's all...
Silence.
[linda]

 Hands Her The Bottle. It's not fair. I told you a really good one.
[HAMILTON] My father hates me.
[linda]

 Gasps.
[HAMILTON] No, that's not the secret. It's my fault...
[linda]

 What is?
[HAMILTON] ... that my sister is the way she is. . Pause. You see, when my mother was carrying Nessa, my father was worried that the new baby might come out...
Both] Green.
[HAMILTON] So he made my mother chew milk flowers, day and night. But that made Nessa come too soon, with her little legs all tangled. And my mother never woke up. None of which ever would have happened if not for me.
[linda]

 But that was the milkflowers fault, not yours. That may be your secret, Elphaba, but that doesn't make it true. She Oh look, it's tomorrow! Elphie... do you mind if I call you Elphie?
[HAMILTON] Well, it's a little perky.
[linda]

 And you can call me... Galinda. So... Elphie... now that we're friends, I've decided to make you my new project!
[HAMILTON] You really don't have to do that.
[linda]

 I know, that's what makes me so nice!

[linda]


WHENEVER I SEE SOMEONE LESS FORTUNATE THAN I
AND LET'S FACE IT... WHO ISN'T
LESS FORTUNATE THAN I?
MY TENDER HEART TENDS TO START TO BLEED
AND WHEN SOMEONE NEEDS A MAKEOVER
I SIMPLY HAVE TO TAKEOVER
I KNOW I KNOW
EXACTLY WHAT THEY NEED
AND EVEN IN YOUR CASE...
THOUGH IT'S THE TOUGHEST CASE I'VE YET TO FACE!

INSTEAD OF DREARY WHO YOU WERE...
WELL ARE...
THERE'S NOTHING THAT CAN STOP YOU
FROM BECOMING POPULER...
LAR!
LA LA LA LA
WE'RE GONNA MAKE YOU POPULAR!
WHEN I SEE DEPRESSING CREATURES
WITH UNPREPOSSESSING FEATURES,
I REMIND THEM ON THEIR OWN BEHALF
TO THINK OF
CELEBRATED HEADS OF STATE
OR ESPECIALLY GREAT COMMUNICATORS
DID THEY HAVE BRAINS OR KNOWLEDGE?
DON'T MAKE ME LAUGH!
THEY WERE POPULAR
PLEASE, IT'S ALL ABOUT POPULAR
IT'S NOT ABOUT APTITUDE
IT'S THE WAY YOU'RE VIEWED
SO IT'S VERY SHREWD TO BE
VERY VERY POPULAR
LIKE ME!
[HAMILTON] This is never going to work!
[linda]

 Oh Elphie, you mustn't think that way anymore! Your whole life is going to change... and all because of me. Okay, stand... I will turn your frock into a beautiful ball gown! Stand up... She Picks Up Her Wand And Waves It. Ball gown!!! Nothing Happens, So She Repeats. Ball gown!!! Still Nothing Happens. She Taps Her Wand On The Bed. Is this thing on?
[HAMILTON] Do you want me to try?
[linda]

 No, I've got it! She Throws The Wand Down. Oh, just wear the frock... it's pretty! Now,
I'll show you how to flip your hair] Flip flip. Or you could use your hand. Demonstrates.
Or, you can use your whole body. Falls onto bed. Squeals. Now, for the finishing touch.
Takes flower out of her hair, puts it into Elphaba's. Why, Miss Elphaba, look at you, you're beautiful. Hands her the mirror.
[HAMILTON] After Looking In The Mirror. I... I have to go.
She Runs Off.
[linda]

 You're Welcome! She Admires Herself In The Mirror.
AND THOUGH YOU PROTEST
YOUR DISINTEREST,
I KNOW CLANDESTINELY...
YOU'RE GONNA GRIN AND BEAR IT
YOUR NEW FOUND POPULARITY! (SQUEALS)
LA LA LA LA
YOU'LL BE POPULAR!
JUST NOT QUITE AS POPULAR
AS ME!!!

[HAMILTON] Flips her hair.. Flip Flip! What?
[BURR]
 Nothing, it's just... you've been "Galinda-fied". You don't have to do that , you know?
[Hamilton]
 Alright, take your seats, class! I have something to say, and very little time to say it. This is my last day here at Shiz I am no longer permitted to teach. I want to thank you for your sharing your enthusiasm, your essays, no matter how feebly structured, and even, on occasion, your lunch.
Mme. Morrible Rushes In.
[Morrible]
 Doctor Dillamond! I'm so dreadfully sorry.
[HAMILTON] Madame, we've got to do something.
[Hamilton]
 Miss Elphaba, they can take away my job, but I shall continue speaking out.
Scientist] Come on, goat...
To Men Begin To Carry Him Out Of The Room.
[Hamilton]
 They are not telling you the whole story! Remember that, class! Remember that.
He Is Gone.
[HAMILTON] Doctor Dillamond! After A Pause. Well, are you just going to sit here in silence?
[Morrible]
 Miss Elphaba, there is nothing we can do. Please take your seat.
Professor] Good afternoon, students!
[Morrible]
 Good afternoon.
Professor] Every day, with every tick of the Time Dragon Clock, in every corner of our great [Oz, one hears the silence of progress. For example] this is called a cage!
He Points To A Cage With A Cloth Draped Over It. He Pulls Off The Cloth, Revealing A Lion Cub Inside.
Professor] Now, we will be seeing more and more of them in the near future. This remarkable innovation is actually for the Animal's own good...
[HAMILTON] If this is for his own good, then why is he trembling?
Professor] He's just excited to be here, that's all. Hits the cage. Now, as I was saying, one of the benefits of caging a Lion cub while he's young is that he never, in fact, will learn how to speak.
[HAMILTON] What?
He Motions The Students Forward, Toward The Cage.
Professor] That's right! Come closer!
[HAMILTON] To Fiyero. Can you imagine a world where Animals are kept in cages and they never speak?
Professor] Now, he may seem a bit agitated but that's easily remedied.
[HAMILTON] What should I do?
[BURR]
 I don't know.
[HAMILTON] Well, somebody has to... Do something!!!
Sparks Begin To Fly Everywhere. All Students & The Professor Are Moving Uncontrollably Except Fiyero and Elphaba.
[BURR]
 What's happening?
[HAMILTON] I don't know I got mad...andd
[BURR]
 Alright just don't move! And don't get mad at me... He Grabs The Cage. Well are you coming?
She Runs With Him After He Snatches The Lion Cub.
[HAMILTON] Careful! Don't shake him!
[BURR]
 I'm not!
[HAMILTON] We can't just let him loose anywhere, you know. We have to find someplace safe...
[BURR]
 Don't you think that I realize that? You must think I'm really stupid or something!
[HAMILTON] No, not really stupid.
[BURR]
 Why is it that every time I see you you're causing some sort of commotion?
[HAMILTON] I don't cause commotions, I am one.
[BURR]
 That's for sure.
[HAMILTON] Oh! So you think I should just keep my mouth shut! Is that what you're saying?
[BURR]
 No, I'm...
[HAMILTON] Do you think I want to be this way? Do you think I want to care this much? Don't you know how much easier my life would be if I didn't?
[BURR]
 Do you ever let anyone else talk?
[HAMILTON] Oh, sorry... But can I just say one more thing? You could have just walked away back there.
[BURR]
 So?
[HAMILTON] So, no matter how shallow and self-absorbed you tend to be...
[BURR]
 Excuse me, there's no pretense here. I happen to be genuinely self-absorbed and deeply shallow.
[HAMILTON] No you're not. Or you wouldn't be so unhappy.
[BURR]
 Fine, if you don't want my help...
[HAMILTON] No, I do! Poor little thing, it's heart is trembling... I didn't mean for...
[BURR]
 What did you mean to do? Why was I the only one you didn't do it to?
[HAMILTON] Oh look, you're bleeding... it must have scratched you. Referring To A Cut On His Face.
[BURR]
 Yea... or maybe it scratched me. I better get to safety... I mean the cub... get the cub to safety. He Walks Off.
[HAMILTON] Fiyero...


[HAMILTON]
HANDS TOUCH
EYES MEET
SUDDEN SILENCE
SUDDEN HEAT
HEARTS LEAP IN A GIDDY WHIRL
HE COULD BE THAT BOY
BUT I'M NOT THAT GIRL
DON'T DREAM TOO FAR
DON'T LOSE SIGHT OF
WHO YOU ARE
DON'T REMEMBER THAT RUSH OF JOY
HE COULD BE THAT BOY
BUT I'M NOT THAT GIRL
EVERY SO OFTEN
WE LONG TO STEAL
TO THE LAND OF "WHAT-MIGHT-HAVE-BEEN"
BUT THAT DOESN'T SOFTEN THE ACHE WE FEEL
WHEN REALITY SETS BACK IN
BLITHE SMILE, LITHE LIMB
SHE WHO'S WINSOME, SHE WINS HIM
GOLD HAIR WITH A GENTLE CURL
THAT'S THE GIRL HE CHOSE
AND HEAVEN KNOWS
I'M NOT THAT GIRL
DON'T WISH
DON'T START
WISHING ONLY WOUNDS THE HEART
I WASN'T BORN FOR THE ROSE AND PEARL
THERE'S A GIRL I KNOW
HE LOVES HER SO
I'M NOT THAT GIRL...

[[HAMILTON]
Miss Elphaba, there you are!
[HAMILTON] Madame Morrible...
[Morrible]
 Oh Miss Elphaba, I finally heard back from the Wizard!
[HAMILTON] The Wizard?
[Morrible]
 Yes, he wishes to meet you!
[HAMILTON] He asked for me?
[Morrible]
 Yes! I know how devastated you were the other day for our poor Doctor Dillamond, but I can assure you my dear, as one door closes, another one opens. She Hands Her A Green Envelope.
[HAMILTON] Madame, I don't know what to say! How can I ever thank you? She Hugs Her.
[Morrible]
 Oh careful dear, you musn't get wet She Places The Umbrella Back Over Elphaba's Head. Oh, I know! She Waves Her Hands And The Sun Comes Out. Didn't I tell you? Weather is my specialty. [Oz-speed, my dear! Make me proud.
[HAMILTON] I will, I'll try.
Morrible Exits.

[HAMILTON]
AND THERE WE'LL FINALLY BE
THE WIZARD AND I...

Conductor] All aboard!
[linda]

 Remember, eye contact. And don't forget to tell him how wonderful he is, Wizards love that! And be yourself... well... within reason.
LAFAYETE Wheels Nessarose Onstage.
[Angelica]
 Elphaba, I'm so proud of you and I know father would be too. We're all proud, aren't we?
[HAMILTON] You'll be alright, won't you?
[linda]

 She'll be fine! Biq will take care of her, right?
[Angelica]
 ...It's LAFAYETE... I... I can't do this anymore.
He Exits.
[Angelica]
 LAFAYETE...
[linda]

 Nessa, maybe he's just not the right one... for you.
[Angelica]
 No, it's me that's not right. Elphaba, just go, I'll be fine.
She Wheels Herself Offstage.
[HAMILTON] Nessa, wait!
[linda]

 Let her go. She'll have to manage without you. We all will.
[HAMILTON] Please, you'll barely even notice I'm gone. Besides, you have Fiyero. Where is he, anyway? Not that I expected him to say goodbye to me. We barely know each other.
[linda]

 I don't know him either. He's distant, and moodified, and he's been thinking, which really worrries me. I never knew how much he card about that old goat.
Fiyero Enters.
[linda]

 Oh, there he is! Fiyero, over here dearest!
[BURR]
 He Hands Elphaba Flowers. Elphaba, I'm happy for you.
[linda]

 Yes, we are both so happy...
[BURR]
 Uh, listen, I've been thinking...
[HAMILTON] Yes, I've heard.
[BURR]
 About that Lion cub and... everything. I think about that day a lot.
[HAMILTON] Really? So do I.
[linda]

 Me too! Poor Doctor Dillamond. It makes one want to... uh...
take a stand. So I've been thinking of... uh... changing my name.
[BURR]
 Your name?
[linda]

 Well, yes! Since Doctor Dillamond had his own way of pronouncing my name,
in solidarity and to express my outrage, I will henceforward be known no longer as Galinda, but as simply, Glinda.
[BURR]
 Oh well, that's very admirable of you... Glinda. To Elphaba. Elphaba, good luck.
He Runs Off.
[Burr] There, see?
[HAMILTON] Galinda...
[Burr] It's Glinda now. Stupid idea, I don't even know what made me say it.
[HAMILTON] It doesn't matter what your name is, everyone loves you!
[Burr] I don't care! I want him. I don't even think he's perfect anymore and I still want him.
This must be what other people feel like. How do they bear it? They embrace.

[HAMILTON] Come with me.
[Burr] Where?
[HAMILTON] To the Emerald City.
[Burr] Really?
[Ozia]

ONE SHORT DAY, IN THE EMERALD CITY...

A Large Head Is Rolled Onstage... It Speaks To The Two... Voice Booming
[Hamilton]
I am [Oz, the great and terrible! Who are you and why do you seek me?
[Burr] Say something!
[HAMILTON] Uh... Elphaba Thropp your terribleness!
His Speaks Normally.
[Hamilton]
Oh? Is that you Elphaba? I didn't realize!
He Climbs Out Of The Head.
[Hamilton]
I hope I didn't startle you, it's so hard to make out peoples' faces all the way back there.
So, let's see... which is which? Elphaba! He grabs her hands. And you must be.
[Burr] Glinda. The Ga is silent.
Elphaba touches the Ozmask.
[Hamilton]
I know. It isn't much, is it? But people expect this sort of thing. You have to give people what they want.
The thing is, I hardly ever let people meet the real me, but this being special occasion.
[HAMILTON] I'm so happy to meet you.
[Hamilton]
Well, that's good. 'Cause that's what I love best] making people happy!
I AM A SENTIMENTAL MAN
WHO ALWAYS LONGED TO BE A FATHER
THAT'S WHY I DO THE BEST I CAN
TO TREAT EACH CITIZEN OF OzAS SON
OR DAUGHTER
SO ELPHABA I'D LIKE TO RAISE YOU HIGH
'CUZ I THINK EVERYONE DESERVES THE CHANCE TO FLY!
AND HELPING YOU WITH YOUR ASCENT
ALLOWS ME TO FEEL SO PARENTAL.
FOR I AM
A SENTIMENTAL MAN!
[HAMILTON] I'm here... we're here to alert you that something bad is happening...
[Hamilton]
Please, I'm the Wizard of [Oz. I already know why you've come.
Elphaba & [Burr] Oooo.
[Hamilton]
Of course, you must prove yourself...
[Burr] Prove yourself, prove yourself.
[HAMILTON] But how?
[Hamilton]
Oh, I don't know.
SOME SORT OF GESTURE
MOSTLY FOR SHOW
SOMETHING TO TEST YOUR ADEPTNESS..
I know! Madame, the book!
Morrible Enters.
[Burr] Madame Morrible...
[Hamilton]
I believe you're well acquainted with my new Press Secretary.
[HAMILTON] Press Secretary?
[Morrible]
 Oh, yes dearies, I've risen up in the world. You'll find that the Wizard is a very generous man.
If you do something for him, he'll do much for you.
[HAMILTON] What do yhou want me to do?
[Hamilton]
Well, this is my monkey servent, Chistery. He looks so longingly at the birds every morning....
[Morrible]
 So the Wizard was thinking, perhaps, a levitation spell...
[Burr] Noticing A Book In Morrible's Hands. Is that the Grimmerie?
[Morrible]
 Yes, the ancient book of spells and enchantments. Hands It To Elphaba.
[Burr] Whispers. Can I touch it?
Morrlbe] Whispers. No!
[HAMILTON] What funny writing...
[Morrible]
 Well it's a lost language. The lost language of spells.
[Hamilton]
It's kind of a recipe book for change.
[Morrible]
 Don't be discouraged if you can't decipherate it, dearie.
I, myself, can only read a spell or two, and that took years and years
[HAMILTON]
AHVEN, TATEY, AVEN TATEY AVEN...
[Hamilton]
She Continues Chanting. Oh, Chistery, what a experience you are about to have!
[HAMILTON] .................................. AH MAY AH TAY ATUM
[Hamilton]
SINCE ONCE I HAVE MY OWN DAY IN THE SKY...
[HAMILTON] AH MAY AH TAH TAY MAY TU SE SAY TA!
[Hamilton]
I KNOW EVERYONE DESERVES THE CHANCE TO FLY!
Chistery Screams & Begins To Twitch.
[HAMILTON] What happened? Is something wrong?
[Morrible]
 No just a transition, dearie.
[HAMILTON] No, stop you're hurting him!
[Hamilton]
She's actually done it!
Chistery Sprouts Wings. And Begins Running Around The Stage.
[HAMILTON] NO! Quick, how do I reverse it?
[Morrible]
 You can't!
[HAMILTON] What?!
[Morrible]
 You can't! Spells are irreversible! I knew she had the power, I told you!
[HAMILTON] You planned all this?
[Morrible]
 Well, you benefit too, dearie! You benefit, too.
[Hamilton]
And this is only the beginning! Look.
The Other Monkeys Begin To Grow Wings And Fly.
[Morrible]
 Won't they make perfect spies?
[HAMILTON] Spies?!
[Hamilton]
You're right, that's a harsh word... how about scouts? That's what they'll be really. They'll fly around [Oz! Report any subversive Animal activity.
[HAMILTON] You can't read this book at all! Can you? That's why you need enemies, and cages, and spies. You have no real power.
[Hamilton]
Exactly... that's why I need you. Don't you see? The world is your oyster, now! You have so many...opportunites. You both do.
[Burr] Thank you, your [Ozness.
Wizard]
SINCE ONCE I HAD MY OWN DAY IN THE SKY
I KNOW EVERYONE DESERVES THE CHANCE TO...
[HAMILTON] NO!
She Runs Off.
[Morrible]
 Elphaba!
[Burr] Elphie! I am so sorry, your Wizardship. I'll fetch her back! Elphie wait!
She Runs After Her.
[Hamilton]
We must get her back. She knows too much.
[Morrible]
 Don't worry! I will handle it.
He Gets Back In The Head. Speaking, Again, With A Powerful Voice.
[Hamilton]
Guards, guards! There is a fugitive loose in the palace! Find her, capture her, and bring her to me!
Guards] Yes your [Ozness!

[Burr] Elphie, wait! Where are you going?
[HAMILTON] Oh no! There are no more stairs! This might be the attic...
[Burr] Elphaba, listen to me...
[HAMILTON] I have to barricade the door! She Picks Up A Broom And Places It Over A Trap Door.
[Burr] Elphaba, why couldn't you have stayed calm for once instead of flying off the handle?
I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY
I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY NOW
I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY HOW YOU'VE HURT YOUR CAUSE FOREVER
I HOPE YOU THINK YOU'RE CLEVER
[HAMILTON]
I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY! I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY TOO
I HOPE YOU'RE PROUD HOW YOU WOULD GROVEL IN SUBMISSION
TO FEED YOUR OWN AMBISSION
Both]
SO THOUGH I CAN'T IMAGINE HOW
I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY
RIGHT NOW...
[Morrible]
 Citizens of [Oz, there is an enemy that must be found and captured! Believe nothing she says. She's evil. Responsible for the mutilation of these poor, innocent monkeys! Her green skin is but an outward manifestation of her twisted nature! This distortion... this repulsion... this... Wicked Witch!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[Burr] Don't be afraid...
[HAMILTON] I'm not... it's the Wizard who should be afraid... of me!
[Burr] Elphie, just say you're sorry before it's too late.
YOU CAN STILL BE WITH THE WIZARD
WHAT YOU'VE WORKED AND WAITED FOR
YOU CAN HAVE ALL YOU EVER WANTED...
[HAMILTON] I know...
BUT I DON'T WANT IT
NO, I CAN'T WANT IT
ANYMORE...
SOMETHING HAS CHANGED WITHIN ME
SOMETHING IS NOT THE SAME
I'M THROUGH WITH PLAYING BY THE RULES
OF SOMEONE ELSE'S GAME!
TOO LATE FOR SECOND GUESSING
TOO LATE TO GO BACK TO SLEEP
IT'S TIME TO TRUST MY INSTINCTS
CLOSE MY EYES...
AND LEAP
IT'S TIME TO TRY DEFYING GRAVITY
I THINK I'LL TRY DEFYING GRAVITY
AND YOU CAN'T PULL ME DOWN
[Burr]
CAN'T I MAKE YOU UNDERSTAND
YOU'RE HAVING DELUSIONS OF GRANDURE?
[HAMILTON]
I'M THROUHG EXCEPTING LIMITS
'CUZ SOMEONE SAYS THEY'RE SO
SOME THINGS I CANNOT CHANGE,
BUT 'TIL I TRY I'LL NEVER KNOW!
TOO LONG I'VE BEEN AFRAID OF
LOSING LOVE I GUESS I'D LOST
WELL IF THAT'S LOVE,
IT COMES AT MUCH TOO HIGH A COST!
I'D SOONER BUY DEFYING GRAVITY
KISS ME GOODBYE I'M DEFYING GRAVITY
AND YOU CAN'T PULL ME DOWN!
The Guards Bang On The Locked Door.
[Guard]
 Open this door, in the name of his supreme [Ozness!
[HAMILTON] Ah May Ah Tay Ah Tum Ditum...
[Burr]
That's what started all this in the first place... that hideous levitation spell! STOP!!!
[Burr] Well... Where are your wings? Maybe you're not as powerful as you think you are...
A Broomstick Floats Across The Room Towards Elphaba.
[HAMILTON] I told you, Glinda... I did it, I tell ya!
The Guards Bang On The Door Once Again.
[HAMILTON] Quick! Get on!
[Burr] What?
[HAMILTON] Come with me... think of what we could do... together.
UNLIMITED, TOGETHER WE'RE UNLIMITED
TOGETHER WE'LL BE THE GREATEST TEAM THERE'S EVER BEEN, GLINDA
DREAMS THE WAY WE PLANNED 'EM
[Burr]
IF WE WORK IN TANDEM
Both]
JUST YOU AND I DEFYING GRAVITY
WITH YOU AND I DEFYING GRAVITY
[HAMILTON]
THEY'LL NEVER BRING US DOWN.
Well, are you coming?
[Burr] Elphie, you're trembling... here, put this around you...
She Drapes A Black Cape Around Her.
I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY
NOW THAT YOU'RE CHOOSING THIS
[HAMILTON] You too.
I HOPE IT BRINGS YOU BLISS
Both]
I REALLY HOPE YOU GET IT
AND YOU DON'T LIVE TO REGRET IT
I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY IN THE END!
I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY...
MY FRIEND...
Elphaba Runs Off. The Guards Break Down The Door.
[Guard]
 There she is! Don't let her get away!
They Grab Hold Of Glinda.
[Burr]
What in [Oz?! Let go of me! Do you hear me? Let go!
[HAMILTON]
It's not her. She has nothing to do with. I'm the one you want. It's me. Hahahahaha. It's me! Up here! It's me!
She Rises Up Center Stage Holding Her Broom.
[HAMILTON]
SO IF YOU CARE TO FIND ME,
LOOK TO THE WESTERN SKY
AS SOMEONE TOLD ME LATELY,
EVERYONE DESERVES THE CHANCE TO FLY!
AND IF I'M FLYING SOLO,
AT LEAST I'M FLYING FREE!
TO THOSE WHO GROUND ME,
TAKE A MESSAGE BACK FROM ME!
TELL THEM HOW I AM DEFYING GRAVITY!!!
I'M FLYING HIGH DEFYING GRAVITY!!!
AND SOON I'LL MATCH THEM IN RENOWN
AND NOBODY

THANK GOODNESS!
[Morrible]
 And thank goodness for you, Glinda, and your handsome swain, our new captain of the guard.
To Fiyero. Now you've been at the forefront of the hunt for the Wicked Witch, haven't you?
[BURR]
 Not really, but I don't like to think of her as a Wicked Witch.
[Morrible]
 Captain, how does it feel?
[BURR]
 Frustrating... but I became captain of the guard to find her, and I will keep searching!
[Morrible]
 No, being engaged!
[Ozia]
 Congratulotions!
[BURR]
 To Glinda - Confused. This is an engagement party?
[Burr] Surprised?
[BURR]
 Yes!
[Burr] Good, we hoped you'd be... the Wizard and I!
WE COULDN'T BE HAPPIER
RIGHT DEAR?
COULDN'T BE HAPPIER
RIGHT HERE
LOOK WHAT WE'VE GOT
A FAIRY TALE PLOT
OUR VERY OWN HAPPY ENDING
WHERE WE COULDN'T BE HAPPIER
TRUE DEAR?
COULDN'T BE HAPPIER
AND WE'RE HAPPY TO SHARE OUR ENDING VICARIOUSLY
WITH ALL OF YOU!
HE COULDN'T LOOK HANDSOMER
I COULDN'T BE HUMBLER
BECAUSE HAPPY IS WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN ALL YOUR DREAMS COME TRUE...
[Morrible]
 And Glinda, dear, we're happy for you! As Press Secretary,
I have striven to ensure that all of Ozknows the story of your braverism! How I vividly remember...
THE DAY YOU WERE FIRST SUMMONED
TO AN AUDIENCE WITH [Oz,
AND ALTHOUGH HE WOULD NOT TELL YOU WHY INITIALLY
WHEN YOU BOWED BEFORE HIS THROWN
HE DECREED YOU'D HENCE BE KNOWN
AS GLINDA THE GOOD
OFFICIALLY!
[BURR]
 That's not how you described it to me.
[Burr] Oh no, not exactly, but Whispers we'll talk about it later.
[Morrible]

THEN WITH A JEALOUS SQUEEE
THE WICKED WITCH BURST FROM CONCEALMENT
WHERE SHE HAD BEEN LURKING
SURREPTITIALLY!
Gasps From Among The Crowd.
[Ozian]
I HEAR SHE HAS AN EXTRA EYE THAT ALWAYS REMAINS AWAKE!
[Ozian]
I HEAR THAT SHE CAN SHED HER SKIN AS EASILY AS A SNAKE!
[Ozian]
I HEAR SOME REBEL ANIMALS ARE GIVING HER FOOD AND SHELTER!
[Ozian]
I HEAR HER SOUL IS SO UNCLEAN, PURE WATER CAN MELT HER!
[BURR]
 What?
[Ozia]

MELT HER! PLEASE SOMEBODY GO AND MELT HER!
[BURR]
 Do you hear that?! Water will melt her? People are so empty-headed they'll believe anything!
[Burr] Excuse me just a tick-tock!
Her And Fiyero Talk Aside.
[BURR]
 I can't just stand here grinning pretending to go along with all of this!
[Burr] Do you think I like to hear them say those awful things about her? I hate it!
[BURR]
 Then what are we doing here? Let's go, let's get out of here!
[Burr] We can't leave now, not when people are looking to us to raise their spirits.
[BURR]
 You can't leave, because you can't resist this. And that is the truth.
[Burr] Maybe I can't. Is that so wrong? Who could?
[BURR]
 You know who could. Who has.
[Burr] Fiyero, I miss her too, but we can't just stop living. No one has searched harder for her than you. But don't you see? She doesn't want to be found. We have to face it.
[BURR]
 You're right. I'm sorry, you're right. And if it's going tol make you happy, of course I'll marry you.
[Burr] But it'll make you happy too, right?
[BURR]
 You know me... I'm always happy. He Runs Off.
[Burr] Fiyero! Thanks plenty dearest! He's gone to fetch me a refreshment, he's so thoughtful that way!
THAT'S WHY I COULDN'T BE HAPPIER
NO, I COULDN'T BE HAPPIER
THOUGH IT IS I ADMIT, THE TINIEST BIT
UNLIKE I ANTICIPATED,
BUT I COULDN'T BE HAPPIER
SIMPLY COULDN'T BE HAPPIER...
Well, not simply...
'CUZ GETTING YOUR DREAMS, IT'S STRANGE BUT IT SEEMS
A LITTLE, WELL, COMPLICATED...
THERE'S A KIND OF A SORT OF COST
THERE'S A COUPLE OF THINGS GET LOST...
THERE ARE BRIDGES YOU CROSSED YOU DIDN'T KNOW YOU CROSSED UNTIL YOU'VE CROSSED!
AND IF THAT JOY THAT THRILL
DOESN'T THRILL LIKE YOU THINK IT WILL...
STILL... WITH THIS PERFECT FINALE
THE CHEERS AND THE BALLYHOO
WHO WOULDN'T BE HAPPIER?
SO I COULDN'T BE HAPPIER
BECAUSE HAPPY IS WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN ALL YOUR DREAMS COME TRUE...
WELL, ISN'T IT?
HAPPY IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOUR DREAMS COME...
TRUE!!!!
[Ozia]

WE LOVE YOU GLINDA IF WE MAY BE SO FRANK!
[Burr]

[Angelica]
 Will there be anything else, Madame?
[Angelica]
 I've asked you to call me Nessarose, remember?
[Angelica]
 Yes, Madame. He Exits.
[Angelica]
 LAFAYETE...
Elphaba's Voice Is Heard Inside A Closet.
[HAMILTON] Well, it seems the beautiful only get more beautiful, Nessarose Screams while the green just get greener.
Nessarose Is Scared And Confused.
Elphaba Steps Out Of The Closet.
[HAMILTON] I'm sorry. Did I scare you? I seem to have that effect on people. It's good to see you.
[Angelica]
 What are you doing here?
[HAMILTON] Well, there's no place like home. I never thought I'd hear myself say this but I need father's help. I need him to stand with me.
[Angelica]
 That's impossible.
[HAMILTON] No, no it's not. Not if you ask him. You know he'll listen to you.
[Angelica]
 Father's dead.
[HAMILTON] What?
[Angelica]
 He's dead. I'm the governor... Well what did you expect? After he learned what you'd done,
how you'd disgraced u,s he died... of shame. Embarrassed to death.
[HAMILTON] Good, I'm glad. It's better that way.
[Angelica]
 That's a wicked thing to say.
[HAMILTON] No, it's true. Because now it's just us. You can help me and together we can...
[Angelica]
 Elphaba, shut up! First of all, I can't harbor a fugitive, I'm an un-elected official!
And why should I help you? You fly around [Oz, trying to rescue animals you've never even met,
and not once have you ever thought to use your powers to rescue me!
ALL OF MY LIFE, I'VE DEPENDED ON YOU
HOW DO YOU THINK THAT FEELS?
ALL OF MY LIFE I'VE DEPENDED ON YOU
AND THIS HIDEOUS CHAIR WITH WHEELS!
SCROUNGING FOR SCRAPS OF PITY TO PICK UP
AND LONGING TO KICK UP
MY HEELS...
[HAMILTON] Nessa, there isn't a spell for everything! The power is mysterious.
It's not like coddling up a pair of... She Pulls Out The Grimmerie From Her Bag. Wait.
[Angelica]
 What are you doing?
Elphaba Begins Chanting.
[Angelica]
 What is that? Ah! My shoes! It feels like... like they're on fire! What have you done to my shoes???
She Lifts Her Dress, Revealing The Ruby Slippers. Nessarose Stands, But Falls. Elphaba Gives Her A Hand.
[Angelica]
 No, don't help me. She Stands.
[HAMILTON] Oh, Nessa, at last...
I'VE DONE WHAT LONG AGO I SHOULD
AND FINALLY FROM THESE POWERS SOMETHING GOOD
FINALLY SOMETHING GOOD...
[Angelica]
 LAFAYETE! LAFAYETE! Come quickly!
[HAMILTON] LAFAYETE?
[Angelica]
 LAFAYETE! Come here at once!
[HAMILTON] No! Nessa, listen, nobody can know I'm here!
Nessarose Runs Behind The Closet As LAFAYETE Enters.
[Angelica]
 Yes, what is it, Madame?
[HAMILTON] LAFAYETE...
[Angelica]
 What are you doing here? You stay back!
[HAMILTON] LAFAYETE, it's just me, I'm not going to hurt you!
[Angelica]
 No! You're lying! That's all you ever do! You and your sister! She's as wicked as you are!
[HAMILTON] What are you talking about?
[Angelica]
 I'm talking about my life. The little that's left of it. I'm not free to leave Munchkinland, none of us are.
Ever since she took power, she's been stripping the Munchkins of our rights...
and we didn't have that many to begin with! And do you know why?
Nessarose Reveals Herself In The Chair.
[Angelica]
 To keep you here, with me. But none of that matters anymore. Look.
Nessarose Stands Up.
[Angelica]
 To Elphaba. You did this for her?
[Angelica]
 For both of us!
[Angelica]
 Nessa, this changes everything.
[Angelica]
 I know.
[Angelica]

LISTEN NESSA...
[Angelica]
 What?
[Angelica]

UH NESSA, SURELY NOW I'LL MATTER LESS TO YOU
AND YOU WON'T MIND MY LEAVING HERE TONIGHT...
[Angelica]
 Leaving?
[Angelica]
 Yes...
THAT BALL THAT'S BEING STAGED
ANNOUNCING GLINDA IS ENGAGED
[Angelica]
 Glinda?
[Angelica]

YES NESSA THAT'S RIGHT!
I'VE GOT TO GO APPEAL TO HER
EXPRESS THE WAY I FEEL TO HER
Oh, Nessa, I lost my heart to Glinda from the moment I first saw her. You know that.
[Angelica]
 Lost your heart? Well, we'll see about that...
[HAMILTON] Nessa, let him go...
[Angelica]

DID YOU THINK I'D LET YOU LEAVE ME HERE FLAT?
[Angelica]
 Don't come any closer!
YOU'RE GOING TO LOSE YOUR HEART TO ME, I TELL YOU!
IF I HAVE TO... I HAVE TO...
Sees The Grimmerie.
MAGIC SPELL YOU...
She Grabs The Book.
[Angelica]
 Ah... Tum... Tah... Tae...
Elphaba Reveals Herself.
[HAMILTON] Nessa, stop!
[Angelica]
 What is she doing?!
[HAMILTON] No, Nessa, you're pronouncing the words all wrong!
[HAMILTON] Nessa!
[Angelica]
 LAFAYETE! What is it?
[Angelica]
 Gasps. My heart feels like it's... shrinking.
[Angelica]
 Elphaba, do something!
[HAMILTON] I can't! You can't reverse a spell once it's been cast!
[Angelica]
 So what do we do?
LAFAYETE Falls Into Nessa's Empty Wheel Chair. Elphaba Wheels Him Behind The Closet.
[Angelica]
 Elphaba, do something!
[Angelica]
 This is all your fault! If you hadn't shown me that horrendible book.
[HAMILTON] I have to find another spell... it's the only thing that might work. She Goes Behind The Closet As Well.
[Angelica]
 Save him, please!
JUST SAVE HIM, MY POOR LAFAYETE, MY SWEET MY BRAVE,
DON'T LEAVE ME 'TIL MY SORRY LIFE HAS CEASED...
Elphaba Wheels The Chair Out, Which Is Not Facing The Audience And Is Seen Casting A Spell.
ALL ALONE AND LOVELESS HERE
JUST THE GIRL IN THE MIRROR
JUST HER AND ME! THE WICKED WITCH OF THE EAST!
WE DESERVE EACH OTHER...
[Angelica]
 Well... what about his heart?
[HAMILTON] It's all right. He won't need one now. I have to go. I have business to attend to in the Emerald City.
Nessa, I have done everything I could for you but it has never been enough and it never will be...
She Leaves.
[Angelica]
 Elphaba, wait! Elphaba!
LAFAYETE Wakes Up.
[Angelica]
 Where am I? What happened?
[Angelica]
 Nothing, LAFAYETE, you just fell asleep... and...
He Sits Up, Squeaking. He Is Made Of Tin. Nessarose Screams.
[Angelica]
 What is it, what's wrong?
[Angelica]
 No, it wasn't me it was her! I tried to stop her.
LAFAYETE Screams Uncontrollably And Runs Off.
[Angelica]
 LAFAYETE, please listen! It was Elphaba! LAFAYETE! It was Elphaba!!!

[Hamilton]
[HAMILTON] Well you have, you have harmed me.
[Hamilton]
I realize that, and I regret it. Elphaba...
[HAMILTON] There you are! I'm setting those monkeys free! And don't try to interfere, or call the guards...
[Hamilton]
I'm not calling anyone. The truth is I'm glad to see you again. It gets pretty lonely around here. And I know you must get lonely too.
[HAMILTON] You don't know the first thing about me.
[Hamilton]
Oh, but I do. I do know you. I can't explain it exactly. You know what I mean? Elphaba, you've been so strong through all of this, aren't you tired of being the strong one? Wouldn't you like someone to take care of you? He Hands Her Back The Broom. Please, help me start again.
[HAMILTON] Don't you think I wish I could? That I could go back to the time when I believed you really were wonderful? The Wonderful Wizard of [Oz? Nobody believed in you more than I did.
[Hamilton]
Oh, my dear child...
I NEVER ASKED FOR THIS OR PLANNED IT IN ADVANCE
I WAS MERELY BLOWN HERE BY THE WINDS OF CHANCE
I NEVER SAW MYSELF AS A SOLOMON OR SOCRATES
I KNEW WHO I WAS, ONE OF YOUR DIME A D[OzEN MEDIOCRATES
THEN SUDDENLY I'M HERE, RESPECTED, WORSHIPED EVEN
JUST BECAUSE THE FOLKS IN OzNEEDED SOMEONE TO BELIEVE IN
DOES IT SURPRISE YOU I GOT HOOKED AND ALL TOO SOON
WHAT CAN I SAY? I GOT CARRIED AWAY
AND NOT JUST BY BALLOON...
WONDERFUL
THEY CALLED ME WONDERFUL
SO I SAID, WONDERFUL, IF YOU INSIST
I WILL BE WONDERFUL
AND THEY SAID WONDERFUL
BELIEVE ME IT'S HARD TO RESIST
'CUZ IT FEELS WONDERFUL
THEY THINK I'M WONDERFUL
HEY LOOK WHO'S WONDERFUL
THIS CORN-FED HICK!
WHO SAID IT MIGHT BE KEEN
TO BUILD A TOWN OF GREEN
AND A WONDERFUL ROAD OF YELLOW BRICK!
See, I never had a family of my own since I was always traveling, and I guess I just wanted to give the citizens of Ozeverything.
[HAMILTON] So you lied to them?
[Hamilton]
Only verbally. Besides, they were the lies they wanted to hear. Elphaba, where I come from we believe all sorts of things that aren't true... we call it history!
A MAN'S CALLED A TRAITOR
OR LIBERATOR
A RICH MAN'S A THIEF
OR PHILANTHROPIST
IS ONE A CRUSADER
OR RUTHLESS INVADER
IT'S ALL IN THE LABEL WHICH IS ABLE TO PERSIST
THERE ARE PRECIOUS FEW AT EASE
WITH MORAL AMBIGUITIES
SO WE ACT AS THOUGH THEY DON'T EXIST...
THEY CALL ME WONDERFUL
SO I AM
INFACT, IT'S SO MUCH WHO I AM IT'S PART OF MY NAME!
AND WITH MY HELP YOU CAN BE THE SAME...
AT LONG, LONG LAST RECEIVE YOUR DUE
LONG OVERDUE
ELPHABA, THE MOST CELEBRATED
ARE THE REHABILITATED
THERE'LL SUCH A WHOOPDEE DOO!
A CELEBRATION THROUGHOUT [Oz,
THAT'S ALL TO DO WITH YOU!
WONDERFUL, THEY'LL CALL YOU WONDERFUL!
[HAMILTON]
THAT DOES SOUND WONDERFUL!
Wizard]
TRUST ME IT'S FUN!!!
Both]
WHEN YOU ARE WONDERFUL,
IT WOULD BE WONDERFUL!
WONDERFUL, WONDERFUL
Wizard]
ONE, TWO AND...
They Dance.
[HAMILTON]
I'LL ACCEPT YOUR PROPOSITION
[Hamilton]
Wonderful
[HAMILTON]
ON ONE CONDITION
[Hamilton]
Yes?
[HAMILTON] You set those Monkeys free.
[Hamilton]
Done.

[HAMILTON] Go! Fly! You're Free! Fly! Chistery, Chistery, you're free, isn't it wonderful?! Go, fly! She Makes Her Way To Another "Monkey" Covered By A Sheet.
[Hamilton]
No! No! Please!
She Pulls Off The Cover, Revealing Dr. Dillamond.
[HAMILTON] No! It can't be! Doctor Dillamond...
[Hamilton]
Elphaba, we just couldn't keep letting him speak out...
[HAMILTON] Doctor Dillamond, are you alright? Don't be afraid. It's me, Elphaba.
[Hamilton]
 Bahhhhh.
[HAMILTON] Doctor, don't you remember me?
[Hamilton]
 Bahhhhh.
[HAMILTON] Can't you speak?
[Hamilton]
 Bahhhhh.
[HAMILTON] No... We have nothing in common. I am nothing like you and I never will be and I will fight you until the day I die!!!
The Wizard Climbs Into The Head And Dr. Dillamond Runs Offstage.

[Hamilton]
Guards, guards!!!
Fiyero Runs In With His Men.
[Guard]
 Halt!
[BURR]
 Are you alright, your [Ozness?
[HAMILTON] Fiyero!
[BURR]
 I don't believe it...
[HAMILTON] Oh , Fiyero, thank God. I thought you were...
[BURR]
 Silence witch!!!
[Guard]
 There's a Goat on the lam, sir.
[BURR]
 Never mind all that. Fetch me some... some water.
[Guard]
 Water, sir?
[BURR]
 You heard me, as much as you can carry.
Guards] Yes, sir!
They March Off.
[HAMILTON] Fiyero...
[BURR]
 I said silence!
[Hamilton]
He Runs Out Of The Head. No! No!
[BURR]
 Don't make a sound, your [Ozness, unless you want all your guests to know the truth about the Wonderful Wizard of [Oz... Elphaba, I'll find Doctor Dillamond later, no get out of here.
[HAMILTON] Fiyero, you frightened me. I thought, I though you might have changed.
[BURR]
 I have... changed.
Glinda Enters.
[Burr] What's going on... Elphie? Oh, thank Ozyou're alive! Only you shouldn't have come. If anyone discoverates you ...
[BURR]
 Glinda, you'd better go.
[Burr] Fiyero, what are you...
[BURR]
 Please, just go back to the ball.
[Burr] Your [Ozness, he means no disrespectation. Please understand! You see, we all went to school together...
[BURR]
 Elphaba!
[Burr] Fiyero, have you misplaced your mind? What are you doing?
[BURR]
 I'm going with her.
[Burr] What? What are you saying? You mean all this time... the two of you... behind my back...
[HAMILTON] No, Glinda it wasn't like that!
[BURR]
 Actually, it was...but it wasn't...Elphaba, let's go... let's go!
They Run Off.
[Burr] Fine, go! You deserve each other...
The Wizard Holds A Small Bottle With A Green Liquid.
[Hamilton]
Here, have a swig of this, it dulls the pain.
[Burr] No, thank you.
Mme. Morrible Enters, Laughing.
[Morrible]
 Oh, is it true? Your betrothed has taken her into custody?
[Hamilton]
Our new captain of the guard had other plans.
[Morrible]
 You mean she hasn't been captured?
[Hamilton]
Quite the contrary. And considering how well she eluded us last time...
[Morrible]
 Well, we'll just flush her out and force her to show herself.
[Hamilton]
But how?
[Burr] Her sister
[Morrible]
 What? What did she say?
[Burr] Use her sister. Spread a rumor. Make her think her sister is in trouble and she will fly to her side... and you'll have her.
[Hamilton]
Exactly so.
[Burr] Now, if your [Ozness will excuse me I have a slight headache, I think I'll lie down.
She Walks Out.
[Morrible]
 Yes, well...a rumor won't do it. Elphaba's too smart for that.
[Hamilton]
Far too smart.
[Morrible]
 Perhaps, a change in the weather...

[Burr]
DON'T WISH, DON'T START
WISHING ONLY WOUNDS THE HEART...
THERE'S A GIRL I KNOW, HE LOVES HER SO...
I'M NOT THAT GIRL...

Only Elphaba & Fiyero Are On Stage, In The Woods
[HAMILTON]
KISS ME TOO FIERCELY, HOLD ME TOO TIGHT
I NEED HELP BELIEVING YOU'RE WITH ME TONIGHT
MY WILDEST DREAMINGS COULD NOT FORSEE
LYING BESIDE YOU WITH YOU WANTING ME
IF JUST FOR THIS MOMENT
AS LONG AS YOU'RE MINE
I'VE LOST ALL RESISTANCE
AND CROSSED SOME BORDERLINE
AND IF IT TURNS OUT
IT'S OVER TOO FAST
I'LL MAKE EVERY LAST MOMENT LAST
AS LONG AS YOU'RE MINE...
[BURR]

MAYBE I'M BRAINLESS, MAYBE I'M WISE,
BUT YOU'VE GOT ME SEEING THROUGH DIFFERENT EYES,
SOMEHOW I'VE FALLEN UNDER YOUR SPELL
AND SOMEHOW I'M FEELING
IT'S UP THAT I FELL
Both]
EVERY MOMENT, AS LONG AS YOU'RE MINE
I'LL WAKE UP MY BODY
AND MAKE UP FOR LOST TIME
[BURR]

SAY THERE'S NO FUTURE
FOR US AS A PAIR...
Both]
AND THOUGH I MAY KNOW,
I DON'T CARE
IF JUST FOR THIS MOMENT
AS LONG AS YOU'RE MINE
COME BE HOW YOU WANT TO
AND SEE HOW BRIGHT WE SHINE!
BORROW THE MOONLIGHT
UNTIL IT IS THROUGH
AND KNOW I'LL BE HERE HOLDING YOU...
AS LONG AS YOU'RE MINE...
[BURR]
 What is it?
[HAMILTON] It's just... for the first time... I feel... wicked.

[HAMILTON] I just wish...
[BURR]
 What?
[HAMILTON] I wish I could be beautiful... for you.
[BURR]
 Elphaba...
[HAMILTON] Don't tell me that I am, you don't need to lie to me.
[BURR]
 It's not lying! It's... uh... it's looking at things another way. Someday, you and Glinda will make up and we'll all...
[HAMILTON] Shh! Listen... Do you hear that? A Shriek Is Heard In The Distance. It sounds like somebody in pain.
[BURR]
 It's just the wind.
[HAMILTON] The Siren Is Heard Again. My sister's in danger.
[BURR]
 What? How do you know?
[HAMILTON] I don't know, I just do... Gasps.
[BURR]
 Elphaba what's wrong, what is it?
[HAMILTON] This! Don't you see it?
[BURR]
 What do you mean? What do you see?
[HAMILTON] It doesn't make any sense... It's a house but it's... it's flying through the sky? I have to go to Nessa!
[BURR]
 I'll come with you!
[HAMILTON] No, you mustn't, it's too dangerous!
[BURR]
 Listen to me, listen! My family has a castle in Kiamo Ko. Now, no one is ever there except for the sentries who watch over it. We've never lived there.
[HAMILTON] Where do you live?
[BURR]
 In the other castle... It's the perfect hiding place; tunnels, secret passageways. You'll be safe there.
[HAMILTON] We will see each other again, won't we?
[BURR]
 Elphaba, we are going to be together always. You can see houses flying through the sky, can't you see that?
They Embrace And Elphaba Runs Off.
Glinda Enters. There Is A House In The Background. The Edge OF The Yellow Brick Road Can Be Seen.
[Burr] That's right, you just take that one road, the whole time. Waves offstage. Oh, I hope they don't get lost. I'm so bad at giving directions. She sees the house, picks up flowers and lays them in front of the house. Oh, Nessa.
Elphaba Appears.
[HAMILTON] What a touching display of grief.
[Burr] I don't think we have anything further to say to one another.
[HAMILTON] I wanted something to remember her by, and all that is left were those shoes, and now that wretched little farm girl has walked off with them. So I'd appreciate some time, alone, to say goodbye to my sister.
Glinda Backs Away As Elphaba Walks Toward The House.
[HAMILTON] Nessa, please, please, please forgive me...
[Burr] Elphie... you mustn't blame yourself. It's dreadful, it is, to have a house fall on you, but accidents will happen.
[HAMILTON] You call this an accident?
[Burr] Yes! Well, maybe not an accident...
[HAMILTON] Well, what do you call it?
[Burr] Well... a regime change. Caused by a bizarre and unexpected twister of fate.
[HAMILTON] You think cyclones just appear out of the blue?
[Burr] I don't know, I never really...
[HAMILTON] No, of course you never! You're too busy telling everyone how wonderful everything is!
[Burr] I'm a public figure, now. People expect me to...
[HAMILTON] Lie?
[Burr] Be encouraging! And what exactly have you been doing besides riding around on that filthy, old thing?
[HAMILTON] Well, we can't all come and go by bubble. Who's invention was that, the Wizard's? Of course, even if it wasn't I'm sure he'd still take credit for it.
[Burr] Yes, well, a lot of us are taking things that don't belong to us, aren't we?
[HAMILTON] Now wait just a clock tick! I know it may be difficult for that blissful, blonde brain of yours to comprehend that someone like him could actually choose someone like me! But it's happened... it's real. And you can wave that ridiculous wand all you want, you can't change it! He never belonged to you, he doesn't love you, and he never did! He loves me!
Glinda Slaps Her.
[HAMILTON] Cackles. Feel better now?
[Burr] Yes, I do.
[HAMILTON] Good, so do I.
She Slaps Glinda. Glinda Then Twirls Her Wand Skillfully And Elphaba Arms Herself With Her Broom. They Charge At Each Other And Then Drop Their "Weapons" And Beat Each Other Senselessly. Glinda Takes Elphaba's Hat Off Her Head And Begins To Whack Her With It. The Guards Run In.
[Guard]
 Halt! In the name of the Wizard!
They Grab Elphaba.
[HAMILTON] Stop! Let me go!
[Burr] Let me go, I almost had her!
[Guard]
 Sorry it took us so long to get here, Miss.
[HAMILTON] I can't believe you would sink this low! To use my sister's death as a trap to capture me?!
[Burr] I never meant for this to happen! Elphie!
Fiyero Swings In On A Rope.
[BURR]
 Let the green girl go!
[Burr] Fiyero, how in [Oz?
[BURR]
 I said let her go! Or explain to all Ozhow the Wizard's guards watched while Glinda the Good was slain.
[Burr] Fiyero...
[BURR]
 I said, let her go.
The Guards Release Her.
[BURR]
 Elphaba, go, now.
[HAMILTON] No, not without you.
[Burr] Fiyero, please.
[BURR]
 Hush! Now! Go!
Elphaba Hesitates.
[Burr] Do it!
She Runs Off.
[Guard]
 Seize him!
[Burr] Wait, what?! What are you doing? Stop it! In the name of goodness, stop! Don't you see? He wasn't going to harm me, he just... he just... he loves her.
[BURR]
 Glinda, I'm so sorry!
[Guard]
 Take him up to that field there! Put him on one of those poles until he tells us where the witch went.
They Drag Him Offstage.
[Burr] No, don't hurt him! Please, don't hurt him! Fiyero!!!!
[HAMILTON] Fiyero!!!!
ELEKA NAHMEN NAHMEN ATUM ATUM ELEKA NAHMEN
ELEKA NAHMEN NAHMEN ATUM ATUM ELEKA NAHMEN
LET HIS FLESH NOT BE TORN LET HIS BLOOD LEAVE NO STAIN,
WILL THEY BEAT HIM, LET HIM FEEL NO PAIN...
LET HIS BONES NEVER BREAK AND HOWEVER THEY TRY TO DESTROY HIM,
LET HIM NEVER DIE, LET HIM NEVER DIE!
ELEKA NAHMEN NAHMEN ATUM ATUM ELEKA NAHMEN
ELEKA NAHMEN NAHMEN ATUM ATUM ELEKA... ELEKA
AH! WHAT GOOD IS THIS CHANTING?
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT I'M READING
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT TRICK I OUGHT TO TRY!
FIYERO WHERE ARE YOU?! ALREADY DEAD OR BLEEDING?
ONE MORE DISASTER I CAN ADD TO MY GENEROUS SUPPLY!
NO GOOD DEED GOES UNPUNISHED
NO ACT OF CHARITY GOES UNRESENTED
NO GOOD DEED GOES UNPUNISHED
THAT'S MY NEW CREED
MY ROAD OF GOOD INTENTIONS
LED WHERE SUCH ROADS ALWAYS LEAD
NO GOOD DEED
GOES UNPUNISHED!
NESSA...
DOCTOR DILLAMOND...
FIYERO...
FIYERO!!!
ONE QUESTION HAUNTS AND HURTS
TOO MUCH, TOO MUCH TO MENTION
WAS I REALLY SEEKING GOOD
OR JUST SEEKING ATTENTION?
IS THAT ALL GOOD DEEDS ARE WHEN LOOKED AT WITH AN ICE COLD EYE?
IF THAT'S ALL GOOD DEEDS ARE
MAYBE THAT'S THE REASON WHY
NO GOOD DEED GOES UNPUNISHED
ALL HELPFUL URGES SHOULD BE CIRCUMVENTED
NO GOOD DEED GOES UNPUNISHED
SURE, I MEANT WELL, WELL LOOK AT WHAT WELL MEANT DID!
ALRIGHT, ENOUGH, SO BE IT!
SO BE IT THEN...
LET ALL OF OzBE AGREED
I'M WICKED THROUGH AND THROUGH
SINCE I COULD NOT SUCCEED
FIYERO SAVING YOU
I PROMISE NO GOOD DEED WILL I ATTEMPT TO DO AGAIN
EVER AGAIN!
NO GOOD DEAD, WILL I DO
AGAIN!!!!!!!!

[Ozia]

GO! AND HUNT HER AND FIND HER AND KILL HER!
Vicious Woman] Good fortune, witch hunters!

[Ozia]

GO! AND HUNT HER AND FIND HER AND KILL HER!
Rabid Man] Kill the witch!
[Ozia]

WICKEDNESS MUST BE PUNISHED
EVIL EFFECTIVELY ELIMINATED
WICKEDNESS MUST BE PUNISHED
KILL THE WITCH!
[Angelica]
 And, this is more than just a service to the Wizard. I have a personal score to settle with Elph... with the witch! Crowd Cheers.
IT'S DUE TO HER I'M MADE OF TIN
HER SPELL MADE THIS OCCUR
SO FOR ONCE I'M GLAD I'M HEARTLESS
I'LL BE HEARTLESS KILLING HER!
And I am not the only one. Looks Offstage. Oh, come on, you! Come out and tell them what she did to you in class that day. How you were just a cub and she cubnapped you.
Lion] No!
[Angelica]

YOU SEE THE LION ALSO
HAS A GRIEVANCE TO REPAY (Lion Roars)
IF SHE'D LET HIM FIGHT HIS OWN BATTLES WHEN HE WAS YOUNG,
HE WOULDN'T BE A COWARD TODAY!

[Burr] No, no, that's not the way it happened! Madame, you've got to stop this, it's gone too far!
[Morrible]
 Oh, I think Elphaba can take care of herself.
[Burr] Madame, something's been troubling me about Nessarose and that cyclone.
[Morrible]
 Oh yes... well, I guess it was just her time.
[Burr] Was it? Or did you...
[Morrible]
 After A Pause. Now, you listen to me, Missy, you may have fooled the rest of Ozwith this "aren't I good" routine, but you know better. You've wanted this since the beginning... and now you're getting what you wanted. So just smile and wave and shut up! Good fortune, good fortune witch hunters!
Rapid Man] Kill her!
Vicious Woman] Kill the witch!
WICKEDNESS MUST BE PUNISHED
BRAVE WITCH HUNTERS I WOULD JOIN YOU IF I COULD
BECAUSE WICKEDNESS MUST BE PUNISHED...
PUNISHED... PUNISHED...
BUT GOOD!!!
[HAMILTON] Oh, for [Oz's sake, stop crying!!! I can't listen to it anymore! Oh, you want to see your Aunt Em and your Uncle What's-his-name again?! Then get those shoes off your feet!!! Little brat... takes a dead woman's shoes; must have been raised in a barn! Chistery! Oh, Chistery, there you are. Where are the others? Chistery motions away. Chistery, please... if you don't at least try to keep speaking you will never... She Sees Glinda. Go away.
[Burr] They're coming for you.
[HAMILTON] Go away!
[Burr] Let the little girl go, and that poor little dog... Dodo.
[Burr] I know you don't want to hear this, but someone has to say it... You are out of control! I mean, come on! They're just shoes, let it go! Elphaba, you can't go on like this.
[HAMILTON] I can do anything I want. I am the Wicked Witch of the West! Another monkey Brings Her A Letter. At last! What took you so long? She Reads It. What's this? Why are you bothering me with this? She Reads On.
[Burr] What is it? What's wrong? It's Fiyero, isn't it? Is he...
[HAMILTON] We've seen his face for the last time.
[Burr] Oh no!
[HAMILTON] You're right... It's time I surrender. Carries A Bucket.
[Burr] Elphie.... Elphie, what is it?
[HAMILTON] You can't be found here! You must go. Refers To A Corner
[Burr] No.
[HAMILTON] You must leave.
[Burr] No! Elphie, I'll tell them everything.
[HAMILTON] No! They'll only turn against you.
[Burr] I don't care!
[HAMILTON] I do! Promise me, promise me, you won't try to clear my name... promise.
[Burr] Alright... I promise. But I don't understand.
[HAMILTON]
I'M LIMITED
JUST LOOK AT ME, I'M LIMITED
AND JUST LOOK AT YOU, YOU CAN DO ALL I COULDN'T DO, GLINDA

[HAMILTON] Here. Go on. Take this. Hands Her The Grimmerie.
[Burr] Elphie... you know I can't read that... Elphie...
[HAMILTON] Well then, you'll have to learn
NOW IT'S UP TO YOU
FOR BOTH OF US
NOW IT'S UP TO YOU
[HAMILTON] You're the only friend I've ever had.
[Burr] And I've had so many friends... but only one that mattered.

[Burr]
I'VE HEARD IT SAID
THAT PEOPLE COME INTO OUR LIVES FOR A REASON
BRINGING SOMETHING WE MUST LEARN
AND WE ARE LED TO THOSE
WHO HELP US MOST TO GROW
IF WE LET THEM
AND WE HELP THEM IN RETURN
WELL, I DON'T KNOW IF I BELIEVE THAT'S TRUE
BUT I KNOW I'M WHO I AM TODAY
BECAUSE I KNEW YOU
LIKE A COMMIT PULLED FROM ORBIT,
AS IT PASSES A SUN
LIKE A STREAM THAT MEETS A BOULDER
HALF WAY THROUGH THE WOOD
WHO CAN SAY IF I'VE BEEN CHANGED FOR THE BETTER?
BUT, BECAUSE I KNEW YOU...
I HAVE BEEN CHANGED
FOR GOOD...
[HAMILTON]
IT WELL MAY BE,
THAT WE WILL NEVER MEET AGAIN
IN THIS LIFETIME
SO LET ME SAY BEFORE WE PART
SO MUCH OF ME
IS MADE OF WHAT I LEARNED FROM YOU
YOU'LL BE WITH ME
LIKE A HANDPRINT ON MY HEART...
AND NOW WHATEVER WAY OUR STORIES END
I KNOW YOU HAVE RE-WRITTEN MINE
BY BEING MY FRIEND...
LIKE A SHIP BLOWN FROM IT'S MOORING
BY A WIND OFF THE SEA
LIKE A SEA DROP BY A SKY BIRD
IN A DISTANT WOOD
WHO CAN SAY IF I'VE BEEN CHANGED FOR THE BETTER?
BUT BECAUSE I KNEW YOU
[Burr]
BECAUSE I KNEW YOU
Both]
I HAVE BEEN CHANGED...
FOR GOOD...
[HAMILTON]
AND JUST TO CLEAR THE AIR
I ASK FORGIVNESS FOR THE THINGS I'VE DONE
YOU BLAME ME FOR.
[Burr]
BUT THEN I GUESS, WE KNOW THERE'S BLAME TO SHARE
Both]
AND NONE OF IT SEEMS TO MATTER ANYMORE!
[Burr] LIKE A COMET PULLED FROM ORBIT AS IT PASSES A SUN...
[HAMILTON] LIKE A SHIP BLOWN FROM ITS MOORING BY A WIND OFF THE SEA
[Burr] LIKE A STREAM THAT MEETS A BOULDER
[HAMILTON] LIKE A SEA DROP BY A BIRD
[Burr] HALFWAY THROUGH THE WOOD
[HAMILTON] IN THE WOOD
[Burr]
WHO CAN SAY IF I'VE BEEN CHANGED FOR THE BETTER?
Both]
I DO BELIEVE I HAVE BEEN CHANGED FOR THE BETTER.
[Burr]
AND, BECAUSE I KNEW YOU
[HAMILTON]
BECAUSE I KNEW YOU
Both]
BECAUSE I KNEW YOU
I HAVE BEEN CHANGED
FOR GOOD...


[HAMILTON] You have to hide. No one can know you were here. Hide yourself!
Elphaba Drapes A Scrim Around The Stage
Offstage Chorus of Women]
AND GOODNESS KNOWS
THE WICKED'S LIVES ARE LONELY
GOODNESS KNOWS THE WICKED DIE ALONE...
LAFAYETE and Other Witch Hunters Run In. You Can See The Silhouette Of The Action Happening Behind The Scrim. Glinda Is Downstage Watching The Action Take Place.
The Mob Surrounds The Witch And She Melts With A Scream The Mob Leaves And Glinda Comes Out From Hiding. She Moves Near The Scrim.
[Burr] Elphie? Elphie? Chistery opens the scrim, where just Elphaba's hat and the green bottle remain. Glinda cries, and grabs the had, holding it against her.
Chistery] Handing Her The Bottle. Miss, Miss Glinda.
[Morrible]
 Well, I don't know why you're so despondiary, I thought it went quite well! They seem thrilled to shreds with their brains and their hearts, and this and that.... Glinda Enters. Oh, Miss Glinda! I thought you'd be out festivating.
[Burr] This was Elphaba's. Holding Out The Bottle.
[Hamilton]
What's that you say?
[Burr] It was a keepsake. It was her mother's. She told me so herself.
I've only seen a little, green bottle like this one other time. It was right here, in this very room. You offered me a drink from it.
Lover's Song Played In Background.
[Hamilton]
But... oh my Lord...
I AM A SENTIMENTAL MAN
WHO ALWAYS LONGED TO BE...
a father...
[Morrible]
 So that was it. That's why she had such powers! She was a child of both worlds!
[Hamilton]
He Cries.
[Burr] I want you to leave [Oz. I'll make the pronouncement myself]
that the strains of wizardship have been too much for you and you are taking an indefinite leave of absence! Did you hear what I said?!
[Hamilton]
Yes, your goodness.
[Burr] You'd better go get your balloon ready. Guards!
He Exits.
[Morrible]
 Glinda, dear, I know we've had our miniscule differentiations in the past...
[Burr] Guards! Madame, have you ever considered how you'd fare in captivity?
[Morrible]
 What?
[Burr] Articulated. Captivity... prison! Personally, I don't think you'll hold up very well.
My professional opinion is that you do not have what it takes. I hope you prove me wrong.
I doubt you will. Take her away!
[Morrible]
 No!!!!

[Ozia]

GOOD NEWS! SHE'S DEAD!
THE WITCH OF THE WEST IS DEAD!
THE WICKEDEST WITCH THERE EVER WAS
THE ENEMY OF ALL OF US, HERE IN [Oz,
IS DEAD!
GOOD NEWS
GOOD NEWS!!!
The Scarecrow (Fiyero) Walks On Stage. He Bends Down & Knocks On A Trap Door In The Floor.
[BURR]
 It worked!
He Opens The Door & Elphaba Climbs Out.
[HAMILTON] Fiyero! I thought you'd never get here.
She Touches His Straw Face.
[BURR]
 Go ahead, touch, I don't mind. Ah, you did the best you could. You saved my life.
[HAMILTON] You're still beautiful.
[BURR]
 You don't have to lie to me.
[HAMILTON] It's not lying... its looking at things another way.
[Ozia]

NO ONE MOURNS THE WICKED
NOW AT LAST SHE'S DEAD AND GONE!
NOW AT LAST THERE'S JOY THROUGHOUT THE LAND!
[Burr] Fellow [Ozians, friends, we have been through a frightening time. There will be other times
and other things that frighten us. But if you let me, I'd like to try to help. I'd like to try to be... Glinda the Good.
[Ozia]

GOOD NEWS!!
[BURR]
 It's time to go.
[HAMILTON] We can never come back to [Oz, can we?
[BURR]
 No.
[HAMILTON] I only wish...
[BURR]
 What?
[HAMILTON] Glinda could know that we're alive.
[BURR]
 She can't know, not if we want to be safe. No one can ever know.
[Ozia]

GOOD NEWS...
[BURR]
 Come...
[Burr]
WHO CAN SAY IF I'VE BEEN CHANGED FOR THE BETTER? BUT...
Elphaba & [Burr]
BECAUSE I KNEW YOU...
[Ozia]

NO ONE MOURNS THE WICKED...
[Burr]
BECAUSE I KNEW YOU...
Elphaba & [Burr]
I HAVE BEEN CHANGED...
Fiyero and Elphaba Leave Through The Clock
[Ozia]

NO ONE MOURNS THE WICKED!

Aaron Burr, Sir

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[COMPANY]
1776. New York City

[HAMILTON]
Pardon me. Are you Aaron Burr, sir?

[BURR]
That depends. Who's asking?

[HAMILTON]
Oh, well, sure, sir
I'm Alexander Hamilton, I'm at your service, sir
I have been looking for you

[BURR]
I'm getting nervous

[HAMILTON]
Sir...
I heard your name at Princeton. I was seeking an accelerated course of study when I got sort of out of sorts with a buddy of yours. I may have punched him. It's a blur, sir. He handles the financials?

[BURR]
You punched the bursar

[HAMILTON]
Yes!
I wanted to do what you did. Graduate in two, then join the revolution. He looked at me like I was stupid, I'm not stupid

So how'd you do it? How'd you graduate so fast?

[BURR]
It was my parents' dying wish before they passed

[HAMILTON]
You're an orphan. Of course! I'm an orphan
God, I wish there was a war!
Then we could prove that we're worth more
Than anyone bargained for...

[BURR]
Can I buy you a drink?

[HAMILTON]
That would be nice

[BURR]
While we're talking, let me offer you some free advice
Talk less

[HAMILTON]
What?

[BURR]
Smile more

[HAMILTON]
Ha

[BURR]
Don't let them know what you're against or what you're for

[HAMILTON]
You can't be serious

[BURR]
You wanna get ahead?

[HAMILTON]
Yes

[BURR]
Fools who run their mouths off wind up dead

[LAURE]

Yo yo yo yo yo!

[LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
Show time!

[BURR]

[LAURE]

Show time! Show time! Yo!
I'm John Laurens in the place to be!
Two pints o' Sam Adams, but I'm workin' on three, uh!
Those redcoats don't want it with me!
Cuz I will pop chick-a pop these cops till I'm free!

[LAFAYETTE]
Oui oui, mon ami, je m'appelle Lafayette!
The Lancelot of the revolutionary set!
I came from afar just to say "Bonsoir!"
Tell the King "Casse toi!" Who's the best?
C'est moi!

[MULLIGAN]
Brrrah brraaah! I am Hercules Mulligan
Up in it, lovin' it, yes I heard ya mother said "Come again?"
Lock up ya daughters and horses, of course
It's hard to have intercourse over four sets of corsets...

[LAURE]

No more sex, pour me another brew, son!
Let's raise a couple more...

[LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
To the revolution!

[LAURE]

Well, if it ain't the prodigy of Princeton college!

[MULLIGAN]
Aaron Burr!

[LAURE]

Give us a verse, drop some knowledge!

[BURR]
Good luck with that] you're takin' a stand
You spit. I'm ‘a sit. We'll see where we land

[LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
Boooo!

[LAURE]

Burr, the revolution's imminent. What do you stall for?

My Shot

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[HAMILTON]
I am not throwing away my shot!
I am not throwing away my shot!
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot!
I'm ‘a get a scholarship to King's College
I prob'ly shouldn't brag, but dag, I amaze and astonish
The problem is I got a lot of brains but no polish
I gotta holler just to be heard
With every word, I drop knowledge!
I'm a diamond in the rough, a shiny piece of coal
Tryin' to reach my goal. My power of speech] unimpeachable
Only nineteen but my mind is older
These New York City streets get colder, I shoulder
Ev'ry burden, ev'ry disadvantage
I have learned to manage, I don't have a gun to brandish
I walk these streets famished
The plan is to fan this spark into a flame
But damn, it's getting dark, so let me spell out the name
I am the-

[HAMILTON/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN/LAURE]

A-L-E-X-A-N-D
E-R-we are-meant to be...

[HAMILTON]
A colony that runs independently
Meanwhile, Britain keeps shittin' on us endlessly
Essentially, they tax us relentlessly
Then King George turns around, runs a spending spree
He ain't ever gonna set his descendants free
So there will be a revolution in this century
Enter me!

[LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN/LAURE]

(He says in parentheses)

[HAMILTON]
Don't be shocked when your hist'ry book mentions me
I will lay down my life if it sets us free
Eventually, you'll see my ascendancy
[HAMILTON]
And I am not throwing away
My shot
I am not throwing away
My shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot
[LAURE]

My shot!

My shot!

And I'm not throwing away my shot.

[HAMILTON/MULLIGAN/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE]
I am not throwing away my shot
I am not throwing away my shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot
It's time to take a shot!

[LAFAYETTE]
I dream of life without a monarchy
The unrest in France will lead to ‘onarchy?
‘Onarchy? How you say, how you say, ‘anarchy?'
When I fight, I make the other side panicky
With my-

[HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
Shot!

[MULLIGAN]
Yo, I'm a tailor's apprentice
And I got y'all knuckleheads in loco parentis
I'm joining the rebellion cuz I know it's my chance
To socially advance, instead of sewin' some pants!
I'm gonna take a-

[HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
Shot!

[LAURE]

But we'll never be truly free
Until those in bondage have the same rights as you and me
You and I. Do or die. Wait till I sally in
On a stallion with the first black battalion
Have another-

[HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
Shot!

[BURR]
Geniuses, lower your voices
You keep out of trouble and you double your choices
I'm with you, but the situation is fraught
You've got to be carefully taught]
If you talk, you're gonna get shot!

[HAMILTON]
Burr, check what we got
Mister Lafayette, hard rock like Lancelot
I think your pants look hot
Laurens, I like you a lot
Let's hatch a plot blacker than the kettle callin' the pot...
What are the odds the gods would put us all in one spot
Poppin' a squat on conventional wisdom, like it or not
A bunch of revolutionary manumission abolitionists?
Give me a position, show me where the ammunition is!

Oh, am I talkin' too loud?
Sometimes I get over excited, shoot off at the mouth
I never had a group of friends before
I promise that I'll make y'all proud

[LAURE]

Let's get this guy in front of a crowd

[HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN/ENSEMBLE]
I am not throwing away my shot
I am not throwing away my shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot

I am not throwing away my shot

Hey yo, I'm just like my country

Whoa, whoa, whoa
Hey!

[HAMILTON]
I imagine death so much it feels more like a memory
When's it gonna get me?
In my sleep? Seven feet ahead of me?
If I see it comin', do I run or do I let it be?
Is it like a beat without a melody?
See, I never thought I'd live past twenty
Where I come from some get half as many
Ask anybody why we livin' fast and we laugh, reach for a flask
We have to make this moment last, that's plenty

Scratch that
This is not a moment, it's the movement
Where all the hungriest brothers with
Something to prove went?
Foes oppose us, we take an honest stand
We roll like Moses, claimin' our promised land
And? If we win our independence?
‘Zat a guarantee of freedom for our descendants?
Or will the blood we shed begin an endless
Cycle of vengeance and death with no defendants?
I know the action in the street is excitin'
But Jesus, between all the bleedin' ‘n fightin'
I've been readin' ‘n writin'
We need to handle our financial situation
Are we a nation of states? What's the state of our nation?
I'm past patiently waitin'. I'm passionately
Smashin' every expectation
Every action's an act of creation!
I'm laughin' in the face of casualties and sorrow
For the first time, I'm thinkin' past tomorrow

[HAMILTON AND COMPANY]
And I am not throwing away my shot

Farmer Refuted

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[SEABURY]
Hear ye, hear ye! My name is Samuel Seabury
And I present "Free Thoughts on the
Proceedings of the Continental Congress!"
Heed not the rabble who scream revolution
They have not your interests at heart

[MULLIGAN]
Oh my God. Tear this dude apart

[SEABURY]
Chaos and bloodshed are not a solution
Don't let them lead you astray
This Congress does not speak for me

[BURR]
Let him be

[SEABURY]
They're playing a dangerous game
I pray the king shows you his mercy
For shame, for shame...
[HAMILTON]
Yo!
He'd have you all unravel at the
Sound of screams but the
Revolution is comin'
The have-nots are gonna
Win this
It's hard to listen to you with a straight face

Chaos and bloodshed already haunt us, honestly you shouldn't even talk. And what about Boston? Look at the cost, n' all that we've lost n' you talk
About Congress?!

My dog speaks more eloquently than thee!

But strangely, your mange is the same

Is he in Jersey?

For the revolution!
[SEABURY]
Heed not the rabble
Who scream
Revolution, they
Have not your
Interests
At heart

Chaos and bloodshed are
Not a
Solution. Don't
Let them lead you
Astray
This Congress does not
Speak for me

They're playing a dangerous game

I pray the king shows you his mercy

For shame

For shame,

[COMPANY]
For the revolution!

[SEABURY]
Heed-

[HAMILTON]
If you repeat yourself again I'm gonna-

Scream-

Honestly, look at me, please don't read!

[SEABURY]
Not your interests-

Don't modulate the key then not debate with me!
Why should a tiny island across the sea regulate the price of tea?

[BURR]
Alexander, please!

You'll Be Back

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[KING GEORGE]
You say
The price of my love's not a price that you're willing to pay
You cry
In your tea which you hurl in the sea when you see me go by
Why so sad?
Remember we made an arrangement when you went away
Now you're making me mad
Remember, despite our estrangement, I'm your man
You'll be back
Soon you'll see
You'll remember you belong to me
You'll be back
Time will tell
You'll remember that I served you well
Oceans rise
Empires fall
We have seen each other through it all
And when push
Comes to shove
I will send a fully armed battalion
To remind you of my love!

Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da
Da da dat dat da ya da!
Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da
Da da dat dat da...

You say our love is draining and you can't go on
You'll be the one complaining when I am gone...
And no, don't change the subject
Cuz you're my favorite subject
My sweet, submissive subject
My loyal, royal subject
Forever and ever and ever and ever and ever...

You'll be back
Like before
I will fight the fight and win the war
For your love
For your praise
And I'll love you till my dying days
When you're gone
I'll go mad
So don't throw away this thing we had

Cuz when push comes to shove
I will kill your friends and family to remind you of my love
Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da
Da da dat dat da ya da!
Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da
Da da dat-
Everybody!

[ENSEMBLE]
Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da
Da da dat dat da ya da!

Thirty-two thousand troops in New York harbor

[HAMILTON]
As a kid in the Caribbean I wished for a war
I knew that I was poor
I knew it was the only way to-

[HAMILTON/BURR/MULLIGAN/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE]
Rise up!

[HAMILTON]
If they tell my story
I am either gonna die on the battlefield in glory or-

[HAMILTON/BURR/MULLIGAN/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE]
Rise up!

[HAMILTON]
We will fight for this land
But there's only one man
Who can give us a command so we can-

[HAMILTON/BURR/MULLIGAN/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE]
Rise up!

[HAMILTON]
Understand? It's the only way to-

[HAMILTON/BURR/MULLIGAN/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE]
Rise up! Rise up!

[HAMILTON]
Here he comes!

[ENSEMBLE]
Here comes the General!

[BURR]
George Washington!
[WASHINGTON]
We are outgunned

Outmanned

Outnumbered
Outplanned

We gotta make an all out stand
Ayo, I'm gonna need a right-hand man.
ENSEMBLE
What?

What?

Buck, buck, buck, buck, buck!

Buck, buck, buck, buck, buck!

[WASHINGTON]
Check it-
Can I be real a second?
For just a millisecond?
Let down my guard and tell the people how I feel a second?
Now I'm the model of a modern major general
The venerated Virginian veteran whose men are all
Lining up, to put me up on a pedestal
Writin' letters to relatives
Embellishin' my elegance and eloquence
But the elephant is in the room
The truth is in ya face when ya hear the British cannons go...

[ENSEMBLE]
Boom!

[WASHINGTON]
Any hope of success is fleeting
How can I keep leading when the people I'm
Leading keep retreating?
We put a stop to the bleeding as the British take Brooklyn
Knight takes rook, but look
[WASHINGTON]
We are outgunned

Outmanned

Outnumbered
Outplanned

We gotta make an all out stand
Ayo, I'm gonna need a right-hand man

Incoming!
[ENSEMBLE]
What?

What?

Buck, buck, buck, buck, buck!

Buck, buck, buck, buck, buck!

[HAMILTON]
They're battering down the Battery check the damages

[MULLIGAN]
Rah!

[HAMILTON]
We gotta stop ‘em and rob ‘em of their advantages

[MULLIGAN]
Rah!

[HAMILTON]
Let's take a stand with the stamina God has granted us
Hamilton won't abandon ship
Yo, let's steal their cannons-
[MULLIGAN]
Shh-boom! [COMPANY]
Boom!

[WASHINGTON]
Goes the cannon, watch the blood and the shit spray and...

[COMPANY]
Boom!

[WASHINGTON]
Goes the cannon, we're abandonin' Kips Bay and...

[COMPANY]
Boom!

[WASHINGTON]
There's another ship and...

[COMPANY]
Boom!

[WASHINGTON]
We just lost the southern tip and...

[COMPANY]
Boom!

[WASHINGTON]
We gotta run to Harlem quick, we can't afford another slip
Guns and horses giddyup
I decide to divvy up
My forces, they're skittish as the British cut the city up
This close to giving up, facing mad scrutiny
I scream in the face of this mass mutiny]
Are these the men with which I am to defend America?
We ride at midnight, Manhattan in the distance
I cannot be everywhere at once, people
I'm in dire need of assistance...

[BURR]
Your excellency, sir!

[WASHINGTON]
Who are you?

[BURR]
Aaron Burr, Sir?
Permission to state my case?

[WASHINGTON]
As you were

[BURR]
Sir
I was a captain under General Montgomery
Until he caught a bullet in the neck in Quebec
And well, in summary
I think that I could be of some assistance
I admire how you keep firing on the British
From a distance

[WASHINGTON]
Huh

[BURR]
I have some questions, a couple of suggestions on how to fight instead of fleeing west

[WASHINGTON]
Yes?

[BURR]
Well-

[HAMILTON]
Your excellency, you wanted to see me?

[WASHINGTON]
Hamilton, come in, have you met Burr?

[HAMILTON]
Yes, sir

[HAMILTON AND BURR]
We keep meeting

[BURR]
As I was saying, sir, I look forward to seeing your strategy play out

[WASHINGTON]
Burr?

[BURR]
Sir?

[WASHINGTON]
Close the door on your way out

[HAMILTON]
Have I done something wrong, sir?

[WASHINGTON]
On the contrary
I called you here because our odds are beyond scary
Your reputation precedes you, but I have to laugh

[HAMILTON]
Sir?

[WASHINGTON]
Hamilton, how come no one can get you on their staff?

[HAMILTON]
Sir!

[WASHINGTON]
Don't get me wrong, you're a young man, of great renown
I know you stole British cannons when we were still downtown
Nathaniel Green and Henry Knox wanted to hire you...

[HAMILTON]
To be their Secretary? I don't think so

[WASHINGTON]
Why're you upset?

[HAMILTON]
I'm not-

[WASHINGTON]
It's alright, you want to fight, you've got a hunger
I was just like you when I was younger
Head full of fantasies of dyin' like a martyr?

[HAMILTON]
Yes

[WASHINGTON]
Dying is easy, young man. Living is harder

[HAMILTON]
Why are you telling me this?

[WASHINGTON]
I'm being honest
I'm working with a third of what our Congress has promised
We are a powder keg about to explode
I need someone like you to lighten the load. So?

[COMPANY (EXCEPT HAMILTON)]
I am not throwin' away my shot!
I am not throwin' away my shot!
Ayo, I'm just like my country, I'm young
Scrappy and hungry!

[HAMILTON]
I am not throwing away my shot!

[WASHINGTON]
Son

[WASHINGON AND COMPANY]
We are outgunned, outmanned!

[HAMILTON]
You need all the help you can get
I have some friends. Laurens, Mulligan
Marquis de Lafayette, okay, what else?

[WASHINGTON AND COMPANY]
Outnumbered, outplanned!

[HAMILTON]
We'll need some spies on the inside
Some King's men who might let some things slide
[HAMILTON]
I'll write to Congress and tell ‘em we need supplies, you rally the guys, master the element of surprise

I'll rise above my station, organize your information, ‘til we rise to the occasion of our new nation. Sir!

[ENSEMBLE]
Here comes the General!

[HAMILTON]

A Winter's Ball

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[BURR]
How does the bastard, orphan, son of a whore
Go on and on
Grow into more of a phenomenon?
Watch this obnoxious, arrogant, loudmouth bother
Be seated at the right hand of the father
Washington hires Hamilton right on sight
But Hamilton still wants to fight, not write
Now Hamilton's skill with a quill is undeniable
But what do we have in common? We're
Reliable with the

[ALL MEN]
Ladies!

[BURR]
There are so many to deflower!

[ALL MEN]
Ladies!

[BURR]
Looks! Proximity to power

[ALL MEN]
Ladies!

[BURR]
They delighted and distracted him
Martha Washington named her feral tomcat after him!

[HAMILTON]
That's true

[FULL COMPANY]
1780

[BURR]
A winter's ball
And the Schuyler sisters are the envy of all
Yo, if you can marry a sister, you're rich, son

[HAMILTON]
Is it a question of if, Burr, or which one?

Helpless

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[HAMILTON/BURR/LAURENS/ALL WOMEN (EXCEPT ELIZA)]
Hey hey hey hey

Ohh, I do I do I do I
Dooo! Hey!
Ohh, I do I do I do I
Dooo! Boy you got me [ALL WOMEN]
Hey hey hey hey
Hey hey hey hey
Hey hey hey hey
Hey hey hey

[ELIZA AND WOMEN]
Helpless!
Look into your eyes, and the sky's the limit I'm helpless!
Down for the count, and I'm drownin' in ‘em

[ELIZA]
I have never been the type to try and grab the spotlight
We were at a revel with some rebels on a hot night
Laughin' at my sister as she's dazzling the room
Then you walked in and my heart went "Boom!"
Tryin' to catch your eye from the side of the ballroom
Everybody's dancin' and the band's top volume

[ELIZA AND WOMEN]
Grind to the rhythm as we wine and dine
[ELIZA]
Grab my sister, and
Whisper, "Yo, this
One's mine."

My sister made her way across the room to you
And I got nervous, thinking "What's she gonna do?"
She grabbed you by the arm, I'm thinkin' "I'm through"
Then you look back at me and suddenly I'm
Helpless!

Oh, look at those eyes

Oh!
Yeah, I'm
Helpless, I know

I'm so into you
I am so into you

I know I'm down for the count
And I'm drownin' in ‘em.

[ALL WOMEN]
Oooh

Oooh

Oooh

Oooh

Helpless!

Look into your eyes
And the sky's the limit
I'm
Helpless!
Down for the count
And I'm drownin' in ‘em

I'm helpless!

Look into your eyes
And the sky's the limit I'm helpless!

Down for the count
And I'm drownin' in ‘em.

[HAMILTON]
Where are you taking me?

[ANGELICA]
I'm about to change your life

[HAMILTON]
Then by all means, lead the way

[ELIZA]
Elizabeth Schuyler. It's a pleasure to meet you

[HAMILTON]
Schuyler?

[ANGELICA]
My sister

[ELIZA]
Thank you for all your service

[HAMILTON]
If it takes fighting a war for us to meet, it will have been worth it

[ANGELICA]
I'll leave you to it

[ELIZA AND WOMEN]
One week later

[ELIZA]
I'm writin' a letter nightly
Now my life gets better, every letter that you write me
Laughin' at my sister, cuz she wants to form a harem

[ANGELICA]
I'm just sayin', if you really loved me, you would share him
[ELIZA]
Ha!
Two weeks later
In the living room stressin'
My father's stone-faced
While you're asking for his blessin'
I'm dying inside, as
You wine
And dine
And I'm tryin' not to cry
‘cause there's nothing that your mind can't do
My father makes his way across the room
To you
I panic for a second, thinking
"we're through"
But then he shakes your hand and says
"Be true"
And you turn back to me, smiling, and I'm
Helpless!

Helpless!
Hoo!

That boy is mine
That boy is mine!

Helpless! Helpless!
Down for the count
And I'm drownin' in em

[ALL WOMEN]
Stressin'

Blessin'

Oooh

Oooh

Oooh

Oooh

Look into your eyes

And I'm drownin' in
‘em I'm
Helpless!

Look into your eyes
And the sky's the
Limit I'm
Helpless!
Down for the count
And I'm drownin' in em

[HAMILTON]
Eliza, I don't have a dollar to my name
An acre of land, a troop to command, a dollop of fame
All I have's my honor, a tolerance for pain
A couple of college credits and my top-notch brain
Insane, your family brings out a different side of me
Peggy confides in me, Angelica tried to take a bite of me
No stress, my love for you is never in doubt
We'll get a little place in Harlem and we'll figure it out
I've been livin' without a family since I was a child
My father left, my mother died, I grew up buckwild
But I'll never forget my mother's face, that was real
And long as I'm alive, Eliza, swear to God
You'll never feel so...

[HAMILTON]
Eliza...

I've never felt so-

My life is gon' be fine cuz Eliza's in it.
[ELIZA]
I do I do I do I do!

I do I do I do I do!

Hey, yeah, yeah!

I'm down for the count
I'm-

I look into your eyes, and the sky's the limit
I'm

...drownin' in ‘em. [ALL WOMEN]
Helpless!

Helpless!

Helpless!

Down for the count
And I'm drownin' in ‘em

Helpless!

Helpless!

Helpless!

Down for the count
And I'm drownin' in ‘em.

Satisfied

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[LAURE]

Alright, alright. That's what I'm talkin' about!
Now everyone give it up for the maid of honor
Angelica Schuyler!
[ANGELICA]
A toast to the groom!

To the bride!

From your sister

Who is always by your side

To your union

And the hope that you provide

May you always...

Be satisfied.

[ALL MEN]
To the groom!
To the groom!
To the groom!

To the bride!
To the bride!

Angelica!
Angelica!
Angelica!

By your side!

To the union!
To the revolution!

You provide!
You provide!

[HAMILTON AND MEN]
Always-

Rewind-

[ALL WOMEN]
To the groom!

To the bride!

To the bride!

[ELIZA AND WOMEN]
Angelica!

By your side!

To the union!
To the revolution!

You provide!

Always-

Rewind-

[ANGELICA]
I remember that night, I just might
Regret that night for the rest of my days

I remember those soldier boys
Tripping over themselves to win our praise

I remember that dreamlike candlelight
Like a dream that you can't quite place

But Alexander, I'll never forget the first
Time I saw your face

I have never been the same
Intelligent eyes in a hunger-pang frame
And when you said "Hi," I forgot my dang name
Set my heart aflame, ev'ry part aflame

[FULL COMPANY]
This is not a game...

[HAMILTON]
You strike me as a woman who has never been satisfied

[ANGELICA]
I'm sure I don't know what you mean. You forget yourself

[HAMILTON]
You're like me. I'm never satisfied

[ANGELICA]
Is that right?

[HAMILTON]
I have never been satisfied

[ANGELICA]
My name is Angelica Schuyler

[HAMILTON]
Alexander Hamilton

[ANGELICA]
Where's your fam'ly from?

[HAMILTON]
Unimportant. There's a million things I haven't done but
Just you wait, just you wait...

[ANGELICA]
So so so-
So this is what it feels like to match wits
With someone at your level! What the hell is the catch? It's
The feeling of freedom, of seein' the light
It's Ben Franklin with a key and a kite! You see it, right?
The conversation lasted two minutes, maybe three minutes
Ev'rything we said in total agreement, it's
A dream and it's a bit of a dance
A bit of a posture, it's a bit of a stance. He's a
Bit of a flirt, but I'm ‘a give it a chance
I asked about his fam'ly, did you see his answer?
His hands started fidgeting, he looked askance?
He's penniless, he's flying by the seat of his pants

Handsome, boy, does he know it!
Peach fuzz, and he can't even grow it!
I wanna take him far away from this place
Then I turn and see my sister's face and she is...

[ELIZA]
Helpless...

[ANGELICA]
And I know she is...

[ELIZA]
Helpless...

[ANGELICA]
And her eyes are just...

[ELIZA]
Helpless...

[ANGELICA]
And I realize

[ANGELICA AND COMPANY]
Three fundamental truths at the exact same time...

[HAMILTON]
Where are you taking me?

[ANGELICA]
I'm about to change your life

[HAMILTON]
Then by all means, lead the way

[COMPANY (EXCEPT ANGELICA)]
Number one!

[ANGELICA]
I'm a girl in a world in which
My only job is to marry rich
My father has no sons so I'm the one
Who has to social climb for one
So I'm the oldest and the wittiest and the gossip in
New York City is insidious
Alexander is penniless
Ha! That doesn't mean I want him any less

[ELIZA]
Elizabeth Schuyler. It's a pleasure to meet you

[HAMILTON]
Schuyler?

[ANGELICA]
My sister

[COMPANY]
Number two!

[ANGELICA]
He's after me cuz I'm a Schuyler sister
That elevates his status, I'd
Have to be naïve to set that aside
Maybe that is why I introduce him to Eliza
Now that's his bride
Nice going, Angelica, he was right
You will never be satisfied

[ELIZA]
Thank you for all your service

[HAMILTON]
If it takes fighting a war for us to meet, it will have been worth it

[ANGELICA]
I'll leave you to it

[COMPANY]
Number three!

[ANGELICA]
I know my sister like I know my own mind
You will never find anyone as trusting or as kind
If I tell her that I love him she'd be silently resigned
He'd be mine
She would say, "I'm fine"

[ANGELICA AND COMPANY]
She'd be lying

[ANGELICA]
But when I fantasize at night
It's Alexander's eyes
As I romanticize what might
Have been if I hadn't sized him
Up so quickly
At least my dear Eliza's his wife;
At least I keep his eyes in my life...
[ANGELICA]
To the groom!

To the bride!

From your sister

Who is always by your side

To your union

And the hope that you provide

May you always

Be satisfied

And I know

She'll be happy as

His bride
And I know [ALL MEN (EXCEPT HAMILTON)]
To the groom!
To the groom!
To the groom!

To the bride!
To the bride!

Angelica!
Angelica!

By your side

To the union!
To the revolution!

You provide!
You provide!

[HAMILTON AND MEN]
Always-

Be satisfied

Be satisfied

[MEN]
Be satisfied
Be satisfied
Be satisfied
Be satisfied

Be satisfied
Be satisfied

Be satisfied
Be satisfied
Be satisfied
Be satisfied.

[ALL WOMEN (EXCEPT ELIZA)]
To the groom!

To the bride!

To the bride!

[ELIZA AND WOMEN]
Angelica!

By your side

To the union!
To the revolution!

You provide!

Always-

Be satisfied

[WOMEN]
Be satisfied

Be satisfied

Be satisfied.

He will never be satisfied

The Story of Tonight (Reprise)

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[LAURE]

I may not live to see our glory!

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE]
I may not live to see our glory!

[LAURE]

But I've seen wonders great and small

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE]
I've seen wonders great and small

[LAURE]

‘Cause if the tomcat can get married

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE]
If Alexander can get married-

[LAURE]

There's hope for our ass, after all!

[LAFAYETTE]
Raise a glass to freedom

[LAURENS/MULLIGAN]
Hey!
Something you will never see again!

[MULLIGAN]
No matter what she tells you

[LAFAYETTE]
Let's have another round tonight!

[LAURE]

Raise a glass to the four of us!

[LAFAYETTE/HAMILTON]
Ho!

[MULLIGAN]
To the newly not poor of us!

[LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/HAMILTON]
Woo!

[LAFAYETTE]
We'll tell the story of tonight

[LAURE]

Let's have another round-

[HAMILTON]
Well, if it isn't Aaron Burr

[BURR]
Sir!

[HAMILTON]
I didn't think that you would make it

[BURR]
To be sure

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE]
Burr!

[BURR]
I came to say congratulations

[MULLIGAN]
Spit a verse, Burr!

[BURR]
I see the whole gang is here

[LAFAYETTE]
You are the worst, Burr!

[HAMILTON]
Ignore them. Congrats to you, Lieutenant Colonel
I wish I had your command instead of manning George's journal

[BURR]
No, you don't

[HAMILTON]
Yes, I do

[BURR]
Now, be sensible
From what I hear, you've made yourself indispensable

[LAURE]

Well, well, I heard
You've got a special someone on the side, Burr

[HAMILTON]
Is that so?

[LAURE]

What are you tryin' to hide, Burr?

[BURR]
I should go

[HAMILTON]
No, these guys should go

[LAFAYETTE]
What?

[LAURE]

No!

[HAMILTON]
Leave us alone

[MULLIGAN]
Man...

[HAMILTON]
It's alright, Burr. I wish you'd brought this girl with you tonight, Burr

[BURR]
You're very kind, but I'm afraid it's unlawful, sir

[HAMILTON]
What do you mean?

[BURR]
She's married

[HAMILTON]
I see

[BURR]
She's married to a British officer

[HAMILTON]
Oh shit...

[BURR]
Congrats again, Alexander. Smile more
I'll see you on the other side of the war

[HAMILTON]
I will never understand you
If you love this woman, go get her! What are you waiting for?

[BURR]
I'll see you on the other side of the war

[HAMILTON]
I'll see you on the other side of the war

Wait For It

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[BURR]
Theodosia writes me a letter everyday
I'm keeping the bed warm while her husband is away
He's on the British side in Georgia
He's trying to keep the colonies in line
But he can keep all of Georgia
Theodosia, she's mine

Love doesn't discriminate
Between the sinners
And the saints
It takes and it takes and it takes
And we keep loving anyway
We laugh and we cry
And we break
And we make our mistakes
And if there's a reason I'm by her side
When so many have tried
Then I'm willing to wait for it
I'm willing to wait for it
[BURR]
My grandfather was a fire and brimstone preacher

But there are things that the
Homilies and hymns won't teach ya

My mother was a genius

My father commanded respect

When they died they left no instructions
Just a legacy to protect

[MEN]
Preacher, preacher
Preacher

Teach ya, teach ya, teach ya

Respect, respect

[WOMEN]
Genius


[LAURE]

GOOD NEWS, SHE'S DEAD!
THE WITCH OF THE WEST IS DEAD!
THE WICKEDEST WITCH THERE EVER WAS,
THE ENEMY OF ALL OF US HERE IN [,
IS DEAD! GOOD NEWS! GOOD NEWS!

[LAURE]

Look, it's Glinda!


[LAURE]

floats in on a giant bubble

[LAURE]

 It's good to see me, isn't it? ([Ozians Agree) No need to respond that was rhetorical. Fellow [Ozia]


[BURR]
LET US BE GLAD,
LET US BE GRATEFUL,
LET US REJOICIFY THAT GOODNESS COULD SUBDUE
THE WICKED WORKINGS OF YOU KNOW WHO!
ISN'T IT NICE TO KNOW
THAT GOOD WILL CONQUER EVIL?
THE TRUTH WE ALL BELIEVE'LL BY AND BY
OUTLIVE A LIE
FOR YOU AND...

[BURR]
Glinda! Exactly how dead is she?

[[Burr] Well, there has been much rumor and speculation... innuendo, outuendo...
but let me set the record straight. According to the Time Dragon Clock, the melting occurred at the 13th hour;
a direct result of a bucket of water thrown by a female child. Yes, the Wicked Witch of the West is dead!

[Ozian]
NO ONE MOURNS THE WICKED!

[Ozian]
NO ONE CRIES THEY WON'T RETURN!

[Ozia]

NO ONE LAYS A LILY ON THEIR GRAVE!
[Ozian Man]
THE GOOD MAN SCORNS THE WICKED!
Women]
THROUGH THEIR LIVES OUR CHILDREN LEARN!

[Ozia]

WHAT WE MISS WHEN WE MISBEHAVE!
[Burr]
AND GOODNESS KNOWS
THE WICKEDS' LIVES ARE LONELY
GOODNESS KNOWS
THE WICKED DIE ALONE
IT JUST SHOWS WHEN YOU'RE WICKED
YOU'RE LEFT ONLY
ON YOUR OWN
[Ozia]

YES, GOODNESS KNOWS
THE WICKEDS' LIVES ARE LONELY
GOODNESS KNOWS
THE WICKED CRY ALONE
NOTHING GROWS FOR THE WICKED
THEY REAP ONLY
WHAT THEY'VE SEWN
[Ozian] Glinda, why does wickedness happen?
[Burr] That's a good question; one that many people find confusifying. Are people born wicked,
or do they have wickedness thrust upon them? After all, she had a childhood,;
She had a father, who just happed to be the governor of munchlinkland Witch's Parents Enter.

[Frex]
 I'm off to the assembly, dear.
[Burr] She had a mother, as so many do...
[Frex]

HOW I HATE TO GO AND LEAVE YOU LONELY
Melena]
THAT'S ALRIGH IT'S ONLY JUST ONE NIGHT
[Frex]

BUT KNOW THAT YOU'RE HERE, IN MY HEART
WHILE I'M OUT OF YOUR SIGHT!
Frex Exits. A Lover Runs Into The Room.
[Burr] And like all families, they had their secrets.
Lover]
HAVE ANOTHER DRINK, MY DARK EYED BEAUTY,
I'VE GOT ONE MORE NIGHT LEFT HERE IN TOWN,
SO HAVE ANOTHER DRINK OF GREEN ELIXER
AND WE'LL HAVE OURSELVES A LITTLE MIXER
HAVE ANOTHER LITTLE SWALLOW LITTLE LADY,
AND FOLLOW ME DOWN
[Burr] And of course, from the moment she was born she was... well... different!
Midwife] AHHH!! It's coming!
[Frex]
 Now?
Midwife] The baby's coming!
[Frex]
 And how!

Midwife]
I SEE A NOSE!
[Frex]

I SEE A CURL!
Both]
IT'S A HEALTHY, PERFECT, LOVELY LITTLE...
(They Scream)
Melena] What is it? What's wrong?
Midwife]
HOW CAN IT BE?
[Frex]

WHAT DOES IT MEAN?
Midwife]
IT'S ATTROCIOUS!
[Frex]

IT'S OBSCENE!
Both]
LIKE A FROGGY, FERNY CABBAGE,
THE BABY IS UNATURALLY
GREEN!!!
[Frex]
 Take it away... Take it away!!!!
[Burr] So you see, it couldn't have been easy!

Munchki]

WICKED!!!!!
[Burr] Well, this has been fun! But as you can imagine I have much to attend to,
what with the Wizard's unexpected departure. So, if there are no further questions...
[Ozian] Glinda, is it true you were her friend?
[Ozians Gasp
[Burr] Well, I... you see... um... yes.
Louder Gasps
[Burr] Well, it depends on what you mean by "friend". She Motions Her Bubble Downward.
I did know her. That is, our paths did cross... at school. But you must understand, it was a long time ago and we were both very young.

[Students]

O, HALLOWED HALLS AND VINE DRAPED WALLS
THE PROUDLIEST SITE THERE IS.
WHEN GREY AND SEER OUR HAIR HATH TURNED,
WE SHALL STILL REVERE THE LESSONS LEARNED
IN OUR DAYS AT DEAR OLD SHIZ (DEAR OLD SHIZ)
OUR DAYS AT DEAR OLD...
[linda]

 Being Wheeled In On A Big Cart Filled With Luggage.
OOOOOOOOOOLD
All]
SHIZZZZZZZZZZZ (DEAR OLD SHIZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ)
Frex Wheels Nessarose On Stage.
[HAMILTON]
 What?! What are you looking at? Oh, do I have something in my teeth?
Okay, let's get this over with. No, I'm not seasick, yes, I've always been green, no, I didn't chew grass as a child.
[Frex]
 Elphaba!
[HAMILTON] Oh, this is my younger sister, Nessarose. As you can see, she is a perfectly normal color.
[Frex]
 Elphaba, stop making a spectacle of yourself! I'm only sending you here for one reason...
[HAMILTON] Yes, I know, to look after Nessarose.
Frex Holds Out A Box.
[Frex]
 My precious little girl] a parting gift.
[Angelica]
 Now, father... He Pulls Silver Shoes From The Box. Jeweled shoes!
[Frex]
 As befits the future governor of Munchkinland. Elphaba, take care of your sister.
And try not to talk so much! He Kisses Nessarose And Exits.
[Angelica]
 Elphaba...
[HAMILTON] Well what could he have gotten me? I clash with everything!
Mme. Morrible Enters
[Morrible]
 Welcome, new students! I am Madame Morrible, headmistress here, at Shiz University.
And whether you're here to study logic, literature, or linguification,
I know I speak for my fellow faculty members when I say we have nothing but the highest hopes for some of you.
Now, regarding room assignments... Elphaba & Galinda Raise Their Hands.
She Notices Galinda First. Yes, is this regarding room assignments?
[linda]

 Oh, Madame, thank you for asking, but I've already been assigned a private suite...
Noticing Her Followers' Disappointment. But you can all come visit me whenever you want!
Shen Shen] How good of you!
Pfanee] You are so good!
[linda]

 No I'm not!
Both] Yes you are!
[linda]

 Now stop! Swishes Her Hair.
[Morrible]
 Do you have a question?

[linda]

 Yes, you see, I am Galinda Upland of the Upperuplands... I've applied to your sorcery seminar,
and indeed that is my sole purpose of attending Shiz; to study sorcery with you.
Perhaps you recall my essay, "Magic Wands, Need They Have A Point".
[Morrible]
 Yes... However, I do not teach my seminar every semester, unless, of course, somebody special were to come along.
[linda]

 Well, exactly!
[HAMILTON] We have not yet received our room assignments.
[Morrible]
 Yes, yes, of course! Oh, You must be Miss Nessarose, the governor's daughter.
What a tragically beautiful face you have! Sees Elphaba, snorts...And you must be.
[HAMILTON] I'm the other daughter. Elphaba. I'm beautifully tragic.
[Morrible]
 Yes, yes, I'm sure you're very bright.
[linda]

 Bright? She's phosphorescent.
[Morrible]
 I don't seem to have you on my list. Oh, well a slight gulch, but not to fret! We'll find someplace to put you.
[linda]

 Y'know, I don't even think she read my essay.
Shen Shen] That's so unfair!
[Angelica]
 You should say something!
[linda]

 Should I?
Pfanee] Do it!
[Morrible]
 Now, which one of you young ladies would like to volunteer to share with Miss Elphaba?
[linda]

 Madame Morrible...
[Morrible]
 Thank you dear. Oh, how very good of you!
[linda]

 What?
[Morrible]
 Miss Elphaba, you may share with Miss Galinda.
[linda]

 Huh?
[Morrible]
 The governor made his concern for your sister's well being quite clear.
So, I thought it would be best if she share my private compartment where I can assist her as needed...
[HAMILTON] But Madame, I've always looked after my sister.
[Morrible]
 Everyone, to your dormitories.
[HAMILTON] But Madame...
[HAMILTON] Let her go!!!
Nessarose's Wheelchair Is Torn From Morrible's Hands And Begins To Wheel Itself Back To Elphaba.
[Morrible]
 How did you do that?
[linda]

 How did she do that?
[Angelica]
 Elphaba!
[Morrible]
 You mean this has happened before?
[HAMILTON] Uh... Something just comes over me sometimes... I'm sorry, Madame.
[Morrible]
 What? Never apologize for talent! Talent is a gift! Have you ever considered a career in sorcery?
[HAMILTON] Sorcery?
[Morrible]
 I shall tutor you myself, and take no other students.
[linda]

 What?
All Students But Galinda Exit.
[Morrible]
 Oh, Miss Elphaba...
MANY YEARS I HAVE WAITED
FOR A GIFT LIKE YOURS TO APPEAR
WHY I PREDICT THE WIZARD COULD MAKE YOU HIS
MAGIC, GRAND VIZIER!
MY DEAR, MY DEAR,
I'LL WRITE AT ONCE TO THE WIZARD
TELL HIM OF YOU IN ADVANCE
WITH A TALENT LIKE YOURS, DEAR, THERE IS
A DEFIN-ISH CHANCE
IF YOU WORK AS YOU SHOULD
YOU'LL BE MAKING GOOD
[linda]

 Madame Morrible...
[Morrible]
 No, not now dearest. She Exits.
[Burr] This will just make me a better person. She simles.
She Runs Off.

[HAMILTON]
DID THAT REALLY JUST HAPPEN?
HAVE I ACTUALLY UNDERSTOOD?
THIS WEIRD QUIRK I'VE TRIED TO SURPRESS OR HIDE
IS A TALENT THAT COULD HELP ME MEET THE WIZARD
IF I MAKE GOOD
SO I'LL MAKE GOOD.
WHEN I MEET THE WIZARD,
ONCE I PROVE MY WORTH,
AND THEN I MEET THE WIZARD,
WHAT I'VE WAITED FOR SINCE
SINCE BIRTH!
AND WITH ALL HIS WIZARD WISDOM
BY MY LOOKS HE WON'T BE BLINDED
DO YOU THINK THE WIZARD IS DUMB?
OR LIKE MUNCHKINS SO SMALL-MINDED? NO!
HE'LL SAY TO ME "I SEE WHO YOU TRULY ARE,
A GIRL ON WHOM I CAN RELY"
AND THAT'S HOW WE'LL BEGIN,
THE WIZARD AND I
ONCE I'M WITH THE WIZARD,
MY WHOLE LIFE WILL CHANGE,
'CUZ ONCE YOU'RE WITH THE WIZARD
NO ONE THINKS YOU'RE STRANGE
NO FATHER IS NOT PROUD OF YOU,
NO SISTER ACTS ASHAMED,
AND ALL OF OzHAS TO LOVE YOU
WHEN BY THE WIZARD YOU'RE ACLAIMED
AND THIS GIFT OR THIS CURSE
THAT I HAVE INSIDE
MAYBE AT LAST I'LL KNOW WHY
WHEN WE ARE HAND IN HAND,
THE WIZARD AND I
AND ONE DAY HE'LL SAY TO ME, "ELPHABA,
A GIRL WHO IS SO SUPERIOR,
SHOULDN'T A GIRL WHO'S SO GOOD INSIDE
HAVE A MATCHING EXTERIOR?
AND SINCE FOLKS HERE TO AN OBSURED DEGREE
SEEM FIXATED ON YOUR VERDEGRIS
WOULD IT BE ALRIGHT BY YOU
IF I DEGREENIFY YOU?"
AND OF COURSE THAT'S NOT IMPORTANT TO ME
"ALRIGHT! WHY NOT?" I'LL REPLY
OH, WHAT A PAIR WE'LL BE
THE WIZARD AND I
YES, WHAT A PAIR WE'LL BE
THE WIZARD AND...
UNLIMITED, MY FUTURE IS UNLIMITED
AND I'VE JUST HAD A VISION ALMOST LIKE A PROPHECY
I KNOW
IT SOUNDS TRULY CRAZY
AND TRUE, THE VISION'S HAZY
BUT I SWEAR SOME DAY THERE'LL BE
A CELEBRATION THROUGHOUT [Oz
THAT'S ALL TO DO
WITH ME!
AND I'LL STAND THERE WITH THE WIZARD
FEELING THINGS I'VE NEVER FELT
AND THOUGH I'D NEVER SHOW IT
I'D BE SO HAPPY I COULD MELT!
AND SO IT WILL BE FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE
AND I'LL WANT NOTHING ELSE 'TILL I DIE
HELD IN SUCH HIGH ESTEEM!
WHEN PEOPLE SEE ME THEY WILL SCREAM
FOR HALF OF [Oz'S FAVORITE TEAM]
THE WIZARD...
AND I!!!!

[linda]

 Dearest, Darlingest Momsy and Popsicle...
[HAMILTON] My dear father...
Both]
THERE'S BEEN SOME CONFUSION OVER ROOMING HERE AT SHIZ
[HAMILTON]

Both]
FOR I KNOW THAT'S HOW YOU'D WANT ME TO RESPOND
Yes...
THERE'S BEEN SOME CONFUSION FOR YOU SEE MY ROOMATE IS...
[linda]


UNUSUALLY, AND EXCEEDLINGLY PECULIAR AND ALTOGETHER QUITE IMPOSSIBLE TO DESCRIBE...

AND I WILL BE LOATHING, LOATHING YOU

[Students]

DEAR GALINDA, YOU ARE JUST TOO GOOD!
HOW DO YOU STAND IT, I DON'T THINK I COULD!
SHE'S A TERROR! SHE'S A TARTAR!
WE DON'T MEAN TO SHOW A BIAS,
BUT GALINDA, YOU'RE A MARTAR!
[linda]

 Well...

[Students]

[HAMILTON] Boo!
[linda]

 Ahh!
[HAMILTON] Hahahaha!

[Hamilton]
 Settle down, now! I have read your most recent essays. And I am amazed to report the progress!
Although, some of us still tend to favor form over content... Ms. Glinda.
[linda]

 It's GAlinda.
[Hamilton]
 Excuse me... Glinda.
[linda]

 I really don't see what the problem is. Every other professor seems to be able to pronounce my name.
[HAMILTON] Maybe pronouncing your precious name isn't the sole purpose of Doctor Dillamond's life. Maybe he's not like every other professor. Maybe some of us are different.
[linda]

 Oh! It seems the artichoke is steamed.
[Hamilton]
 Class, class! Miss Elphaba has a point! As you know, I am the sole Animal on the faculty. The token Goat, as it were. But it wasn't always this way. Oh, dear students, how I wish you could have seen it as it once was. Where you could walk down the halls and see an antelope explicating a sonnet, a snow leopard solving an equation, a wildebeast waxing philosophic. Don't you see, dear students, how our dear Ozis becoming less and less...looks at Elphaba... colorful. Now, who can tell me what sent these events into motion?
[HAMILTON] Raises hand From what I've heard, it all started with the great drought.
[Hamilton]
 Exactly. Food grew scarce, people grew hungrier and angrier. And the question became "Whom can we blame?" Can anyone tell me what is meant by the term "Scapegoat"? Elphaba Raises Hand. Someone besides Miss Elphaba? Ah yes, Miss Glinda...
[linda]

 It's GAlinda... with a GA. I don't see why you can't just teach us history instead of always harping on the past.
[Hamilton]
 Well, perhaps these questions will enlighten you... Walks Over To The Chalk Board And Turns It Over. On it is written] ANIMALS SHOULD BE SEEN AND NOT HEARD. Who is responsible for this? I'm waiting for answer... Very well, that will be all for today... You heard me, class dismissed!!!
All Students Exit Except Elphaba & Nessarose. Dillamond Has His Back Turned To Her.
[HAMILTON] You go on ahead, Nessa.
Nessarose Exits.
[HAMILTON] Reading The Board Aloud. "Animals should be seen and not heard..."
[Hamilton]
 Oh, Miss Elphaba, don't worry about me, go along and enjoy your friends.
[HAMILTON] Oh that's alright, I have no friends. Would you like to share my lunch?
[Hamilton]
 Oh, thank you! How kind.
She Pulls Out A Candy Bar And Unwraps It. He Takes The Paper and Begins To Eat It. He Sees The Board.
[Hamilton]
 I seem to have lost my appetite.
[HAMILTON] You shouldn't let statements like that bother you. I mean, I always do, but you shouldn't.
[Hamilton]
if it were only a matter of words on a chalkboard. But the things one hears these days... dreadful things! Miss Elphaba...

I'VE HEARD OF AN OX, A PROFESSOR FROM QUOX
NO LONG PERMITTED TO TEACH,
WHO HAS LOST ALL POWERS OF SPEECH.
AND AN OWL IN MUNCHKIN ROCK
A VICAR WITH A THRIVING FLOCK
FORBIDDEN TO PREACH
NOW HE ONLY CAN SCREECH!
ONLY RUMORS, BUT STILL, ENOUGH TO GIVE PAUSE
TO ANYONE WITH PAWS
SOMETHING BAD IS HAPPENING IN [Oz
[HAMILTON]
SOMETHING BAD?
HAPPENING IN [Oz?
[Hamilton]

UNDER THE SURFACE
BEHIND THE SCENES
SOMETHING BAAAAAH...
Sorry, bad...
[HAMILTON] Dr. Dillamond, are you alright? Shall I fetch you a glass of water?
[Hamilton]
 No, I don't know what came over me.
[HAMILTON] So, you're saying that there are animals that have, somehow, forgotten how to speak? But, how is that possible?
[Hamilton]
 Well, with so much pressure not to...
Morrible Enters.
[Morrible]
 I heard there was some sort of disturburance in class. Are you alright, Doctor? Oh, Miss Elphaba, you're still here! I thought you would have been on your way to my seminar by now.
[HAMILTON] Yes Madame, ordinarily I would be but...
[Morrible]
 But what? I do hope I have not misplaced my trust in you. Magic is a very demanderating mistress, and if one has ambitions of meeting the Wizard. I'm sure Doctor Dillamond sees my point.
Morrible Exits.
[HAMILTON] I'd better go. Doctor Dillamond, if something bad is happening to the Animals then someone has to tell the Wizard. That's why we have a Wizard!
SO NOTHING BAD
Both]
NOTHNG ALL THAT BAD
[Hamilton]

NOTHING TRULY BAAAAHHH...
Sorry... Bad.
[HAMILTON]
IT COULDN'T HAPPEN HERE,
IN [Oz...


[BURR]
 Here we are, sir! Shiz University!
[BURR]
 What? Already?
[BURR]
 Yes, sir.
[BURR]
 What a shame. Well, we'll see you soon, Avaric. Don't worry, I won't last longer at this school than I did at any of the others.
Avaric Exits.
[Angelica]
 Uh, miss Galinda, I know I'm just a munchkin, but munchkins have feelings too, and I've been trying to tell you mine, for you. But sometimes it seems like you don't even know I'm there.
[linda]

 That's not true, Biq.
[Angelica]
 It's LAFAYETE.
[linda]

 Biq, do you know who that is? That's Fiyero Tiggular, tha Winkie Prince whose reputation is so scandalacious!
LAFAYETE Looks Disgusted. Fiyero Walks Toward Them. Galinda Swishes Her Hair. Fiyero, Noticing Her Strange Behavior, Does The Same.
[linda]

 To Fiyero. Were you looking for something or someone?
[BURR]
 Uhhh yea... history... class? I don't know... somewhere?
[Angelica]
 History building is way over there my friend...
[linda]

 That class just ended!
[BURR]
 Oh! Perfect timing! So, uh, what does one do for fun around here?
[linda]

 Nothing really... until now...
[Angelica]
 We've been studying!
[BURR]
 Well, I see that once again the responsibility to corrupt my fellow students falls to me. Fortunately, I'm up for the task.


[BURR]

THE TROUBLE WITH SCHOOLS IS
THEY ALWAYS TRY TO TEACH THE WRONG LESSON
BELIEVE ME, I'VE BEEN KICKED OUT OF ENOUGH OF THEM TO KNOW!
THEY WANT YOU TO BECOME LESS CALLOW, LESS SHALLOW,
BUT I SAY WHY INVITE STRESS IN?
STOP STUDYING STRIFE
AND LEARN TO LIVE
THE UNEXAMINED LIFE...
DANCIN' THROUGH LIFE
SKIMMING THE SURFACE
GLIDING WHERE TURF IS SMOOTH
LIFE IS PAINLESS FOR THE BRAINLESS
THOSE WHO DON'T TRY, NEVER LOOK FOOLISH
DANCING THROUGH LIFE
NO NEED TO TOUGH IT
WHEN YOU CAN SLUFF IT OFF AS I DO
NOTHING MATTERS, BUT KNOWING NOTHING MATTERS
IT'S JUST LIFE, SO KEEP DANCING THROUGH
DANCING THROUGH LIFE
SWAYING AND SWEEPING
AND ALWAYS KEEPING COOL
LIFE IS FRAUGHTLESS
WHEN YOU'RE THOUGHTLESS
THOSE WHO DON'T TRY
NEVER LOOK FOOLISH
DANCING THROUGH LIFE
MINDLESS AND CARELESS
MAKE SURE YOU'RE WHERE LESS TROUBLE IS RIFE
WHOES ARE FLEETING
BLOWS ARE GLANCING
WHEN YOU'RE DANCING
THROUGH LIFE!
So! What's the most swankified place in town?
[linda]

 That would be the

Sounds perfect!
LET'S GO DOWN TO THE [OzDUST BALLROOM
WE'LL MEET THERE LATER TONIGHT
WE CAN DANCE 'TIL IT'S LIGHT
FIND THE PRETTIEST GIRL
GIVE HER A WHIRL!
RIGHT ON DOWN TO THE [OzDUST BALLROOM
COME ON FOLLOW ME!
YOU'LL BE HAPPY TO BE THERE
[Students]

DANCIN' THROUGH LIFE, DOWN AT THE [OzDUST (LIFE!)
[BURR]

IF ONLY BECAUSE DUST IS WHAT WE COME TO!
[Students]

NOTHIN' MATTERS, BUT KNOWING NOTHING MATTERS
IT'S JUST LIFE!!!
[BURR]

SO KEEP DANCING THROUGH...
[Angelica]
 Miss Galinda? I hope you'll save at least one dance for me. I'll be waiting right there, right by your side, waiting, all night.
[linda]

 Oh, how very kind, Biq.
[Angelica]
 ... LAFAYETE...
[linda]

 But, do you know what would be even kinder?
SEE THAT TRAGICALLY BEAUTIFUL GIRL?
THE ONE IN THE CHAIR?
IT SEEMS SO UNFAIR
WE SHOULD GO ON A SPREE
AND NOT SHE, GEE
I KNOW SOMEONE WOULD BE MY HERO
IF THAT SOMEONE WERE
TO GO INVITE HER!
[Angelica]
 Well, maybe I could invite her!
[linda]


OH, BIQ, REALLY?
YOU WOULD DO THAT FOR ME?
[Angelica]
 I would do anything for you, Miss Galinda. Walks Over To Nessarose.
Excuse me, Miss Nessarose? There's something I'd like to ask you...
[BURR]
 To Galinda. You're good.
[linda]

 I don't know what you mean. But I do happen to be free tonight, so...
[BURR]
 So, I'll be picking you up around eight?
[linda]

 After all...
NOW THAT WE'VE MET ONE ANOTHER,
Both]
IT'S CLEAR WE DESERVE EACHOTHER!
[linda]

 You're perfect!
[BURR]
 You're perfect!
[CAST]
SO WE'RE PERFECT TOGETHER
BORN TO BE FOREVER
DANCING THROUGH LIFE!!!
[HAMILTON] It's absurd! This silly, rich boy appears and everyone's off to worship him and some cultish social gathering!
[Angelica]
 Even me! I'm going! Isn't it wonderful? LAFAYETE was too shy to ask me at first, but once Galinda encouraged him...
[HAMILTON] Galinda?!
[Angelica]
 Don't you dare say another word against her! I'm about to have the first happy night of my life all thanks to Galinda!
FINALLY FOR THIS ONE NIGHT,
I'M ABOUT TO HAVE A FUN NIGHT
WITH THIS MUNCHKIN BOY GALINDA FOUND FOR ME
AND I ONLY WISH THERE WERE
SOMETHING I COULD DO FOR HER TO REPAY HER
ELPHABA SEE...
WE DESERVE EACHOTHER AND GALINDA HELPED IT COME TRUE
WE DESERVE EACHOTHER, ME AND LAFAYETE
Please, Elphaba, try to understand.
[HAMILTON] I do...
[linda]

 Now I must accessorize myself for Fiyero.
Shen Shen Pulls The Witch's Hat Out Of One Of Galinda's Hat Boxes.
Pfanee] Galinda, what in [Oz's name!?
[linda]

 Now, just pretend you didn't see that. My granny is always giving me the most hideodeous hats.
I'd give it away, but I don't hate anyone that much.
Shen Shen] Yes you do!
Pfanee] Give it to her! Just do it!
They All Stare At Elphaba. Galinda Walks Forward, Meeting Elphaba Half Way.
[HAMILTON] Galinda, listen, Nessa and I were talking about you just now...
[linda]

 And I was just talking about you! I thought you might want to wear this hat to the party tonight! Gives Her The Hat.
IT'S REALLY... UH... SHARP!
DON'T YOU THINK?
Y'KNOW BLACK, IS THIS YEAR'S PINK!
YOU DESERVE EACHOTHER,
THIS HAT AND YOU,
YOU'RE BOTH SO... SMART!
YOU DESERVE EACHOTHER, SO HERE!
OUT OF THE GOODNESS OF MY HEART!
Galinda Runs Off. Elphaba Laughs At The Sight Of The Hat. She Exits.. The Students Enter And Dance.
When This Is Done, LAFAYETE And Nessarose Appear, Awkwardly Holding Hands.
[Angelica]
 What's in the punch?
[Angelica]
 Lemons, and melons, and pears!
[Angelica]
 Oh my!
[Angelica]

LISTEN NESSA...
[Angelica]
 Yes?
[Angelica]

UH, NESSA...
I'VE GOT SOMETHING TO CONFESS A
REASON WHY, WELL, WHY I ASKED YOU HERE TONIGHT...
NOW, I KNOW IT ISN'T FAIR.
[Angelica]
 Oh, LAFAYETE, I know why.
[Angelica]
 You do?
[Angelica]

IT'S BECAUSE I'M IN THIS CHAIR, AND YOU FELT SORRY FOR ME...
WELL, ISN'T THAT RIGHT?
[Angelica]
 No... it's because... uh... because...
BECAUSE YOU ARE SO BEAUTIFUL!
[Angelica]
 Oh, LAFAYETE!
I THINK YOU'RE WONDERFUL!
AND WE DESERVE EACH OTHER, DON'T YOU SEE THIS IS OUR CHANCE?
WE DESERVE EACH OTHER, DON'T WE LAFAYETE?
[Angelica]
 You know what? Let's dance!
[Angelica]
 What?
[Angelica]

LET'S DANCE!
They Dance, As Well As The Others Around Them. Finally, Mme. Morrible Runs Up To Galinda.
[Morrible]
 Oh, Miss Upland?
[linda]

 Madame Morrible... What are you doing here?
[Morrible]
 I have something for you. She Hands Her A Small Wand.
[linda]

 Gasps. Madame... a training wand... How can I ever express my graditution?
[Morrible]
 Oh, don't thank me! This was your roommate's idea, not mine.
[linda]

 What? Elphaba?
[Morrible]
 Miss Elphaba requested that I include you in sorcery class. She insisted I tell you this very night or she would quit the seminar.
[linda]

 But... why?
[Morrible]
 I have no idea. My personal opinion is you do not have what it takes. I hope you'll prove me wrong... I doubt you will.
She Leaves. Fiyero Comes Up To Galinda.
[BURR]
 What is it?
[linda]

 I got what I wanted...
[BURR]
 Then what's the matter?
[linda]

 Nothing...
[BURR]
 Good. Let's dance...
They Begin To Dance As Elphaba Walks In. They Stop As All The Students Gasp And Make Comments About The Way She Is Dressed. People Then Start Laughing.
[BURR]
 Who in Ozis this?
[linda]

 My roommate... please, don't ... stare!
[BURR]
 How can you help it?
Elphaba Takes Off The Hat, Noticing The Comments. She Waits, Then Puts It Back On And Begins To Dance. She Is Alone. There Is No Music.
[BURR]
 Well I'll say this, she doesn't give a twig about what anyone else thinks.
[linda]

 Of course does, she just pretends not to... I feel awful...
[BURR]
 Why? It's not like it's your fault.
[linda]

 Excuse me... She Walks Over To Elphaba and Clears Her Throat. May I cut in?
Galinda Begins Dancing Just As Horribly. The Students Now Accept It, And Begin To Dance Again As The Music Starts.
All]
DANCING THROUGH LIFE, DOWN AT THE [OzDUST
IF ONLY BECAUSE DUST IS WHAT WE COME TO
AND THE STRANGE THING, YOUR LIFE COULD END UP CHANGING
WHILE YOU'RE DANCING THROUGH

[Scene 9 - Sharing Secrets]
Elphaba & Galinda Barge Into Their Suite... Galinda Is In Hysterics.
[linda]

 Your very first party ever?! Your very first party! Oh I know! Let's tell each other something we've never told anyone... I'll go first] Fiyero and I are going to be married (squeals).
[HAMILTON] Really? He's asked you already?
[linda]

 No, he doesn't know yet... Now, you tell me a secret.
[HAMILTON] Like what?
[linda]

 Like... Why do you always sleep with this funny, little, green bottle under your pillow? Grabs The Bottle.
[HAMILTON] Give that back.
[linda]

 C'mon, tell me. Tell me tell me!
[HAMILTON] It was my mother's! That's all...
Silence.
[linda]

 Hands Her The Bottle. It's not fair. I told you a really good one.
[HAMILTON] My father hates me.
[linda]

 Gasps.
[HAMILTON] No, that's not the secret. It's my fault...
[linda]

 What is?
[HAMILTON] ... that my sister is the way she is. . Pause. You see, when my mother was carrying Nessa, my father was worried that the new baby might come out...
Both] Green.
[HAMILTON] So he made my mother chew milk flowers, day and night. But that made Nessa come too soon, with her little legs all tangled. And my mother never woke up. None of which ever would have happened if not for me.
[linda]

 But that was the milkflowers fault, not yours. That may be your secret, Elphaba, but that doesn't make it true. She Oh look, it's tomorrow! Elphie... do you mind if I call you Elphie?
[HAMILTON] Well, it's a little perky.
[linda]

 And you can call me... Galinda. So... Elphie... now that we're friends, I've decided to make you my new project!
[HAMILTON] You really don't have to do that.
[linda]

 I know, that's what makes me so nice!

[linda]


WHENEVER I SEE SOMEONE LESS FORTUNATE THAN I
AND LET'S FACE IT... WHO ISN'T
LESS FORTUNATE THAN I?
MY TENDER HEART TENDS TO START TO BLEED
AND WHEN SOMEONE NEEDS A MAKEOVER
I SIMPLY HAVE TO TAKEOVER
I KNOW I KNOW
EXACTLY WHAT THEY NEED

I'LL SHOW YOU WHAT SHOES TO WEAR
HOW TO FIX YOUR HAIR
EVERYTHING THAT REALLY COUNTS TO BE POPULAR

INSTEAD OF DREARY WHO YOU WERE...
WELL ARE...
THERE'S NOTHING THAT CAN STOP YOU
FROM BECOMING POPULER...
LAR!
LA LA LA LA
WE'RE GONNA MAKE YOU POPULAR!
WHEN I SEE DEPRESSING CREATURES
WITH UNPREPOSSESSING FEATURES,
I REMIND THEM ON THEIR OWN BEHALF
TO THINK OF
CELEBRATED HEADS OF STATE
OR ESPECIALLY GREAT COMMUNICATORS
DID THEY HAVE BRAINS OR KNOWLEDGE?
DON'T MAKE ME LAUGH!
THEY WERE POPULAR
PLEASE, IT'S ALL ABOUT POPULAR
IT'S NOT ABOUT APTITUDE
IT'S THE WAY YOU'RE VIEWED
SO IT'S VERY SHREWD TO BE
VERY VERY POPULAR
LIKE ME!
[HAMILTON] This is never going to work!
[linda]

 Oh Elphie, you mustn't think that way anymore! Your whole life is going to change... and all because of me. Okay, stand... I will turn your frock into a beautiful ball gown! Stand up... She Picks Up Her Wand And Waves It. Ball gown!!! Nothing Happens, So She Repeats. Ball gown!!! Still Nothing Happens. She Taps Her Wand On The Bed. Is this thing on?
[HAMILTON] Do you want me to try?
[linda]

 No, I've got it! She Throws The Wand Down. Oh, just wear the frock... it's pretty! Now,
I'll show you how to flip your hair] Flip flip. Or you could use your hand. Demonstrates.
Or, you can use your whole body. Falls onto bed. Squeals. Now, for the finishing touch.
Takes flower out of her hair, puts it into Elphaba's. Why, Miss Elphaba, look at you, you're beautiful. Hands her the mirror.
[HAMILTON] After Looking In The Mirror. I... I have to go.
She Runs Off.
[linda]

 You're Welcome! She Admires Herself In The Mirror.
AND THOUGH YOU PROTEST
YOUR DISINTEREST,
I KNOW CLANDESTINELY...
YOU'RE GONNA GRIN AND BEAR IT
YOUR NEW FOUND POPULARITY! (SQUEALS)
LA LA LA LA
YOU'LL BE POPULAR!
JUST NOT QUITE AS POPULAR
AS ME!!!

[HAMILTON] Flips her hair.. Flip Flip! What?
[BURR]
 Nothing, it's just... you've been "Galinda-fied". You don't have to do that , you know?
[Hamilton]
 Alright, take your seats, class! I have something to say, and very little time to say it. This is my last day here at Shiz I am no longer permitted to teach. I want to thank you for your sharing your enthusiasm, your essays, no matter how feebly structured, and even, on occasion, your lunch.
Mme. Morrible Rushes In.
[Morrible]
 Doctor Dillamond! I'm so dreadfully sorry.
[HAMILTON] Madame, we've got to do something.
[Hamilton]
 Miss Elphaba, they can take away my job, but I shall continue speaking out.
Scientist] Come on, goat...
To Men Begin To Carry Him Out Of The Room.
[Hamilton]
 They are not telling you the whole story! Remember that, class! Remember that.
He Is Gone.
[HAMILTON] Doctor Dillamond! After A Pause. Well, are you just going to sit here in silence?
[Morrible]
 Miss Elphaba, there is nothing we can do. Please take your seat.
Professor] Good afternoon, students!
[Morrible]
 Good afternoon.
Professor] Every day, with every tick of the Time Dragon Clock, in every corner of our great [Oz, one hears the silence of progress. For example] this is called a cage!
He Points To A Cage With A Cloth Draped Over It. He Pulls Off The Cloth, Revealing A Lion Cub Inside.
Professor] Now, we will be seeing more and more of them in the near future. This remarkable innovation is actually for the Animal's own good...
[HAMILTON] If this is for his own good, then why is he trembling?
Professor] He's just excited to be here, that's all. Hits the cage. Now, as I was saying, one of the benefits of caging a Lion cub while he's young is that he never, in fact, will learn how to speak.
[HAMILTON] What?
He Motions The Students Forward, Toward The Cage.
Professor] That's right! Come closer!
[HAMILTON] To Fiyero. Can you imagine a world where Animals are kept in cages and they never speak?
Professor] Now, he may seem a bit agitated but that's easily remedied.
[HAMILTON] What should I do?
[BURR]
 I don't know.
[HAMILTON] Well, somebody has to... Do something!!!
Sparks Begin To Fly Everywhere. All Students & The Professor Are Moving Uncontrollably Except Fiyero and Elphaba.
[BURR]
 What's happening?
[HAMILTON] I don't know I got mad...andd
[BURR]
 Alright just don't move! And don't get mad at me... He Grabs The Cage. Well are you coming?
She Runs With Him After He Snatches The Lion Cub.
[HAMILTON] Careful! Don't shake him!
[BURR]
 I'm not!
[HAMILTON] We can't just let him loose anywhere, you know. We have to find someplace safe...
[BURR]
 Don't you think that I realize that? You must think I'm really stupid or something!
[HAMILTON] No, not really stupid.
[BURR]
 Why is it that every time I see you you're causing some sort of commotion?
[HAMILTON] I don't cause commotions, I am one.
[BURR]
 That's for sure.
[HAMILTON] Oh! So you think I should just keep my mouth shut! Is that what you're saying?
[BURR]
 No, I'm...
[HAMILTON] Do you think I want to be this way? Do you think I want to care this much? Don't you know how much easier my life would be if I didn't?
[BURR]
 Do you ever let anyone else talk?
[HAMILTON] Oh, sorry... But can I just say one more thing? You could have just walked away back there.
[BURR]
 So?
[HAMILTON] So, no matter how shallow and self-absorbed you tend to be...
[BURR]
 Excuse me, there's no pretense here. I happen to be genuinely self-absorbed and deeply shallow.
[HAMILTON] No you're not. Or you wouldn't be so unhappy.
[BURR]
 Fine, if you don't want my help...
[HAMILTON] No, I do! Poor little thing, it's heart is trembling... I didn't mean for...
[BURR]
 What did you mean to do? Why was I the only one you didn't do it to?
[HAMILTON] Oh look, you're bleeding... it must have scratched you. Referring To A Cut On His Face.
[BURR]
 Yea... or maybe it scratched me. I better get to safety... I mean the cub... get the cub to safety. He Walks Off.
[HAMILTON] Fiyero...


[HAMILTON]

THAT'S THE GIRL HE CHOSE
AND HEAVEN KNOWS
I'M NOT THAT GIRL

WISHING ONLY WOUNDS THE HEART
I WASN'T BORN FOR THE ROSE AND PEARL
THERE'S A GIRL I KNOW
HE LOVES HER SO
I'M NOT THAT GIRL...

[[HAMILTON]
Miss Elphaba, there you are!
[HAMILTON] Madame Morrible...
[Morrible]
 Oh Miss Elphaba, I finally heard back from the Wizard!
[HAMILTON] The Wizard?
[Morrible]
 Yes, he wishes to meet you!
[HAMILTON] He asked for me?
[Morrible]
 Yes! I know how devastated you were the other day for our poor Doctor Dillamond, but I can assure you my dear, as one door closes, another one opens. She Hands Her A Green Envelope.
[HAMILTON] Madame, I don't know what to say! How can I ever thank you? She Hugs Her.
[Morrible]
 Oh careful dear, you musn't get wet She Places The Umbrella Back Over Elphaba's Head. Oh, I know! She Waves Her Hands And The Sun Comes Out. Didn't I tell you? Weather is my specialty. [Oz-speed, my dear! Make me proud.
[HAMILTON] I will, I'll try.
Morrible Exits.

[HAMILTON]
AND THERE WE'LL FINALLY BE
THE WIZARD AND I...

Conductor] All aboard!
[linda]

 Remember, eye contact. And don't forget to tell him how wonderful he is, Wizards love that! And be yourself... well... within reason.
LAFAYETE Wheels Nessarose Onstage.
[Angelica]
 Elphaba, I'm so proud of you and I know father would be too. We're all proud, aren't we?
[HAMILTON] You'll be alright, won't you?
[linda]

 She'll be fine! Biq will take care of her, right?
[Angelica]
 ...It's LAFAYETE... I... I can't do this anymore.
He Exits.
[Angelica]
 LAFAYETE...
[linda]

 Nessa, maybe he's just not the right one... for you.
[Angelica]
 No, it's me that's not right. Elphaba, just go, I'll be fine.
She Wheels Herself Offstage.
[HAMILTON] Nessa, wait!
[linda]

 Let her go. She'll have to manage without you. We all will.
[HAMILTON] Please, you'll barely even notice I'm gone. Besides, you have Fiyero. Where is he, anyway? Not that I expected him to say goodbye to me. We barely know each other.
[linda]

 I don't know him either. He's distant, and moodified, and he's been thinking, which really worrries me. I never knew how much he card about that old goat.
Fiyero Enters.
[linda]

 Oh, there he is! Fiyero, over here dearest!
[BURR]
 He Hands Elphaba Flowers. Elphaba, I'm happy for you.
[linda]

 Yes, we are both so happy...
[BURR]
 Uh, listen, I've been thinking...
[HAMILTON] Yes, I've heard.
[BURR]
 About that Lion cub and... everything. I think about that day a lot.
[HAMILTON] Really? So do I.
[linda]

 Me too! Poor Doctor Dillamond. It makes one want to... uh...
take a stand. So I've been thinking of... uh... changing my name.
[BURR]
 Your name?
[linda]

 Well, yes! Since Doctor Dillamond had his own way of pronouncing my name,
in solidarity and to express my outrage, I will henceforward be known no longer as Galinda, but as simply, Glinda.
[BURR]
 Oh well, that's very admirable of you... Glinda. To Elphaba. Elphaba, good luck.
He Runs Off.
[Burr] There, see?
[HAMILTON] Galinda...
[Burr] It's Glinda now. Stupid idea, I don't even know what made me say it.
[HAMILTON] It doesn't matter what your name is, everyone loves you!
[Burr] I don't care! I want him. I don't even think he's perfect anymore and I still want him.
This must be what other people feel like. How do they bear it? They embrace.

[HAMILTON] Come with me.
[Burr] Where?
[HAMILTON] To the Emerald City.
[Burr] Really?
[Ozia]

ONE SHORT DAY, IN THE EMERALD CITY...

[HAMILTON] I want to remember this moment, always. Nobody's pointing, nobody's staring, for the first time, I'm somewhere that I belong.

A Large Head Is Rolled Onstage... It Speaks To The Two... Voice Booming
[Hamilton]
I am [Oz, the great and terrible! Who are you and why do you seek me?
[Burr] Say something!
[HAMILTON] Uh... Elphaba Thropp your terribleness!
His Speaks Normally.
[Hamilton]
Oh? Is that you Elphaba? I didn't realize!
He Climbs Out Of The Head.
[Hamilton]
I hope I didn't startle you, it's so hard to make out peoples' faces all the way back there.
So, let's see... which is which? Elphaba! He grabs her hands. And you must be.
[Burr] Glinda. The Ga is silent.
Elphaba touches the Ozmask.
[Hamilton]
I know. It isn't much, is it? But people expect this sort of thing. You have to give people what they want.
The thing is, I hardly ever let people meet the real me, but this being special occasion.
[HAMILTON] I'm so happy to meet you.
[Hamilton]
Well, that's good. 'Cause that's what I love best] making people happy!
I AM A SENTIMENTAL MAN
WHO ALWAYS LONGED TO BE A FATHER
THAT'S WHY I DO THE BEST I CAN
TO TREAT EACH CITIZEN OF OzAS SON
OR DAUGHTER
SO ELPHABA I'D LIKE TO RAISE YOU HIGH
'CUZ I THINK EVERYONE DESERVES THE CHANCE TO FLY!
AND HELPING YOU WITH YOUR ASCENT
ALLOWS ME TO FEEL SO PARENTAL.
FOR I AM
A SENTIMENTAL MAN!
[HAMILTON] I'm here... we're here to alert you that something bad is happening...
[Hamilton]
Please, I'm the Wizard of [Oz. I already know why you've come.
Elphaba & [Burr] Oooo.
[Hamilton]
Of course, you must prove yourself...
[Burr] Prove yourself, prove yourself.
[HAMILTON] But how?
[Hamilton]
Oh, I don't know.
SOME SORT OF GESTURE
MOSTLY FOR SHOW
SOMETHING TO TEST YOUR ADEPTNESS..
I know! Madame, the book!
Morrible Enters.
[Burr] Madame Morrible...
[Hamilton]
I believe you're well acquainted with my new Press Secretary.
[HAMILTON] Press Secretary?
[Morrible]
 Oh, yes dearies, I've risen up in the world. You'll find that the Wizard is a very generous man.
If you do something for him, he'll do much for you.
[HAMILTON] What do yhou want me to do?
[Hamilton]
Well, this is my monkey servent, Chistery. He looks so longingly at the birds every morning....
[Morrible]
 So the Wizard was thinking, perhaps, a levitation spell...
[Burr] Noticing A Book In Morrible's Hands. Is that the Grimmerie?
[Morrible]
 Yes, the ancient book of spells and enchantments. Hands It To Elphaba.
[Burr] Whispers. Can I touch it?
Morrlbe] Whispers. No!
[HAMILTON] What funny writing...
[Morrible]
 Well it's a lost language. The lost language of spells.
[Hamilton]
It's kind of a recipe book for change.
[Morrible]
 Don't be discouraged if you can't decipherate it, dearie.
I, myself, can only read a spell or two, and that took years and years
[HAMILTON]
AHVEN, TATEY, AVEN TATEY AVEN...
[Hamilton]
She Continues Chanting. Oh, Chistery, what a experience you are about to have!
[HAMILTON] .................................. AH MAY AH TAY ATUM
[Hamilton]
SINCE ONCE I HAVE MY OWN DAY IN THE SKY...
[HAMILTON] AH MAY AH TAH TAY MAY TU SE SAY TA!
[Hamilton]
I KNOW EVERYONE DESERVES THE CHANCE TO FLY!
Chistery Screams & Begins To Twitch.
[HAMILTON] What happened? Is something wrong?
[Morrible]
 No just a transition, dearie.
[HAMILTON] No, stop you're hurting him!
[Hamilton]
She's actually done it!
Chistery Sprouts Wings. And Begins Running Around The Stage.
[HAMILTON] NO! Quick, how do I reverse it?
[Morrible]
 You can't!
[HAMILTON] What?!
[Morrible]
 You can't! Spells are irreversible! I knew she had the power, I told you!
[HAMILTON] You planned all this?
[Morrible]
 Well, you benefit too, dearie! You benefit, too.
[Hamilton]
And this is only the beginning! Look.
The Other Monkeys Begin To Grow Wings And Fly.
[Morrible]
 Won't they make perfect spies?
[HAMILTON] Spies?!
[Hamilton]
You're right, that's a harsh word... how about scouts? That's what they'll be really. They'll fly around [Oz! Report any subversive Animal activity.
[HAMILTON] You can't read this book at all! Can you? That's why you need enemies, and cages, and spies. You have no real power.
[Hamilton]
Exactly... that's why I need you. Don't you see? The world is your oyster, now! You have so many...opportunites. You both do.
[Burr] Thank you, your [Ozness.
Wizard]
SINCE ONCE I HAD MY OWN DAY IN THE SKY
I KNOW EVERYONE DESERVES THE CHANCE TO...
[HAMILTON] NO!
She Runs Off.
[Morrible]
 Elphaba!
[Burr] Elphie! I am so sorry, your Wizardship. I'll fetch her back! Elphie wait!
She Runs After Her.
[Hamilton]
We must get her back. She knows too much.
[Morrible]
 Don't worry! I will handle it.
He Gets Back In The Head. Speaking, Again, With A Powerful Voice.
[Hamilton]
Guards, guards! There is a fugitive loose in the palace! Find her, capture her, and bring her to me!
Guards] Yes your [Ozness!

[Burr] Elphie, wait! Where are you going?
[HAMILTON] Oh no! There are no more stairs! This might be the attic...
[Burr] Elphaba, listen to me...
[HAMILTON] I have to barricade the door! She Picks Up A Broom And Places It Over A Trap Door.
[Burr] Elphaba, why couldn't you have stayed calm for once instead of flying off the handle?
I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY
I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY NOW
I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY HOW YOU'VE HURT YOUR CAUSE FOREVER
I HOPE YOU THINK YOU'RE CLEVER
[HAMILTON]
I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY! I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY TOO
I HOPE YOU'RE PROUD HOW YOU WOULD GROVEL IN SUBMISSION
TO FEED YOUR OWN AMBISSION
Both]
SO THOUGH I CAN'T IMAGINE HOW
I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY
RIGHT NOW...
[Morrible]
 Citizens of [Oz, there is an enemy that must be found and captured! Believe nothing she says. She's evil. Responsible for the mutilation of these poor, innocent monkeys! Her green skin is but an outward manifestation of her twisted nature! This distortion... this repulsion... this... Wicked Witch!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[Burr] Don't be afraid...
[HAMILTON] I'm not... it's the Wizard who should be afraid... of me!
[Burr] Elphie, just say you're sorry before it's too late.
YOU CAN STILL BE WITH THE WIZARD
WHAT YOU'VE WORKED AND WAITED FOR
YOU CAN HAVE ALL YOU EVER WANTED...
[HAMILTON] I know...
BUT I DON'T WANT IT
NO, I CAN'T WANT IT
ANYMORE...
SOMETHING HAS CHANGED WITHIN ME
SOMETHING IS NOT THE SAME
I'M THROUGH WITH PLAYING BY THE RULES
OF SOMEONE ELSE'S GAME!
TOO LATE FOR SECOND GUESSING
TOO LATE TO GO BACK TO SLEEP
IT'S TIME TO TRUST MY INSTINCTS
CLOSE MY EYES...
AND LEAP
IT'S TIME TO TRY DEFYING GRAVITY
I THINK I'LL TRY DEFYING GRAVITY
AND YOU CAN'T PULL ME DOWN
[Burr]
CAN'T I MAKE YOU UNDERSTAND
YOU'RE HAVING DELUSIONS OF GRANDURE?
[HAMILTON]
I'M THROUHG EXCEPTING LIMITS
'CUZ SOMEONE SAYS THEY'RE SO
SOME THINGS I CANNOT CHANGE,
BUT 'TIL I TRY I'LL NEVER KNOW!
TOO LONG I'VE BEEN AFRAID OF
LOSING LOVE I GUESS I'D LOST
WELL IF THAT'S LOVE,
IT COMES AT MUCH TOO HIGH A COST!
I'D SOONER BUY DEFYING GRAVITY
KISS ME GOODBYE I'M DEFYING GRAVITY
AND YOU CAN'T PULL ME DOWN!
The Guards Bang On The Locked Door.
[Guard]
 Open this door, in the name of his supreme [Ozness!
[HAMILTON] Ah May Ah Tay Ah Tum Ditum...
[Burr]
That's what started all this in the first place... that hideous levitation spell! STOP!!!
[Burr] Well... Where are your wings? Maybe you're not as powerful as you think you are...
A Broomstick Floats Across The Room Towards Elphaba.
[HAMILTON] I told you, Glinda... I did it, I tell ya!
The Guards Bang On The Door Once Again.
[HAMILTON] Quick! Get on!
[Burr] What?
[HAMILTON] Come with me... think of what we could do... together.
UNLIMITED, TOGETHER WE'RE UNLIMITED
TOGETHER WE'LL BE THE GREATEST TEAM THERE'S EVER BEEN, GLINDA

[HAMILTON]
THEY'LL NEVER BRING US DOWN.
Well, are you coming?
[Burr] Elphie, you're trembling... here, put this around you...
She Drapes A Black Cape Around Her.
I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY
NOW THAT YOU'RE CHOOSING THIS
[HAMILTON] You too.
I HOPE IT BRINGS YOU BLISS
Both]
I REALLY HOPE YOU GET IT
AND YOU DON'T LIVE TO REGRET IT
I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY IN THE END!
I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY...
MY FRIEND...
Elphaba Runs Off. The Guards Break Down The Door.
[Guard]
 There she is! Don't let her get away!
They Grab Hold Of Glinda.
[Burr]
What in [Oz?! Let go of me! Do you hear me? Let go!
[HAMILTON]
It's not her. She has nothing to do with. I'm the one you want. It's me. Hahahahaha. It's me! Up here! It's me!
She Rises Up Center Stage Holding Her Broom.
[HAMILTON]
SO IF YOU CARE TO FIND ME,
LOOK TO THE WESTERN SKY
AS SOMEONE TOLD ME LATELY,
EVERYONE DESERVES THE CHANCE TO FLY!
AND IF I'M FLYING SOLO,
AT LEAST I'M FLYING FREE!

To Fiyero. Now you've been at the forefront of the hunt for the Wicked Witch, haven't you?
[BURR]
 Not really, but I don't like to think of her as a Wicked Witch.
[Morrible]
 Captain, how does it feel?
[BURR]
 Frustrating... but I became captain of the guard to find her, and I will keep searching!
[Morrible]
 No, being engaged!

WHEN YOU BOWED BEFORE HIS THROWN
HE DECREED YOU'D HENCE BE KNOWN
AS GLINDA THE GOOD
OFFICIALLY!
[BURR]
 That's not how you described it to me.
[Burr] Oh no, not exactly, but Whispers we'll talk about it later.
[Morrible]

THEN WITH A JEALOUS SQUEEE
THE WICKED WITCH BURST FROM CONCEALMENT
WHERE SHE HAD BEEN LURKING
SURREPTITIALLY!
Gasps From Among The Crowd.
[Ozian]
I HEAR SHE HAS AN EXTRA EYE THAT ALWAYS REMAINS AWAKE!
[Ozian]
I HEAR THAT SHE CAN SHED HER SKIN AS EASILY AS A SNAKE!
[Ozian]
I HEAR SOME REBEL ANIMALS ARE GIVING HER FOOD AND SHELTER!
[Ozian]
I HEAR HER SOUL IS SO UNCLEAN, PURE WATER CAN MELT HER!
[BURR]
 What?
[Ozia]

MELT HER! PLEASE SOMEBODY GO AND MELT HER!
[BURR]
 Do you hear that?! Water will melt her? People are so empty-headed they'll believe anything!
[Burr] Excuse me just a tick-tock!
Her And Fiyero Talk Aside.
[BURR]
 I can't just stand here grinning pretending to go along with all of this!
[Burr] Do you think I like to hear them say those awful things about her? I hate it!
[BURR]
 Then what are we doing here? Let's go, let's get out of here!
[Burr] We can't leave now, not when people are looking to us to raise their spirits.
[BURR]
 You can't leave, because you can't resist this. And that is the truth.
[Burr] Maybe I can't. Is that so wrong? Who could?
[BURR]
 You know who could. Who has.
[Burr] Fiyero, I miss her too, but we can't just stop living. No one has searched harder for her than you. But don't you see? She doesn't want to be found. We have to face it.
[BURR]
 You're right. I'm sorry, you're right. And if it's going tol make you happy, of course I'll marry you.
[Burr] But it'll make you happy too, right?
[BURR]
 You know me... I'm always happy. He Runs Off.
[Burr] Fiyero! Thanks plenty dearest! He's gone to fetch me a refreshment, he's so thoughtful that way!
THAT'S WHY I COULDN'T BE HAPPIER
NO, I COULDN'T BE HAPPIER
THOUGH IT IS I ADMIT, THE TINIEST BIT
UNLIKE I ANTICIPATED,
BUT I COULDN'T BE HAPPIER
SIMPLY COULDN'T BE HAPPIER...
Well, not simply...
'CUZ GETTING YOUR DREAMS, IT'S STRANGE BUT IT SEEMS
A LITTLE, WELL, COMPLICATED...
THERE'S A KIND OF A SORT OF COST
THERE'S A COUPLE OF THINGS GET LOST...
THERE ARE BRIDGES YOU CROSSED YOU DIDN'T KNOW YOU CROSSED UNTIL YOU'VE CROSSED!
AND IF THAT JOY THAT THRILL
DOESN'T THRILL LIKE YOU THINK IT WILL...
STILL... WITH THIS PERFECT FINALE
THE CHEERS AND THE BALLYHOO
WHO WOULDN'T BE HAPPIER?
SO I COULDN'T BE HAPPIER
BECAUSE HAPPY IS WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN ALL YOUR DREAMS COME TRUE...
WELL, ISN'T IT?
HAPPY IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOUR DREAMS COME...
TRUE!!!!
[Ozia]

WE LOVE YOU GLINDA IF WE MAY BE SO FRANK!
[Burr]
THANK GOODNESS!
[Ozia]

FOR ALL THIS JOY WE KNOW WHO WE'VE GOT TO THANK!
THANK GOODNESS!
THAT MEANS THE WIZARD, GLINDA...
[Burr]
AND FIANCE!
[Ozia]

THEY COULDN'T BE GOODLIER
SHE COULDN'T BE LOVLIER
WE COULDN'T BE LUCKIER!
[Burr] I COULDN'T BE HAPPIER!!!
[Ozia]
 THANK GOODNESS!!!
[Burr] TODAY!!!!
[Ozia]
 TODAY, THANK GOODNESS FOR TODAY!


[Angelica]
 Will there be anything else, Madame?
[Angelica]
 I've asked you to call me Nessarose, remember?
[Angelica]
 Yes, Madame. He Exits.
[Angelica]
 LAFAYETE...
Elphaba's Voice Is Heard Inside A Closet.
[HAMILTON] Well, it seems the beautiful only get more beautiful, Nessarose Screams while the green just get greener.
Nessarose Is Scared And Confused.
Elphaba Steps Out Of The Closet.
[HAMILTON] I'm sorry. Did I scare you? I seem to have that effect on people. It's good to see you.
[Angelica]
 What are you doing here?
[HAMILTON] Well, there's no place like home. I never thought I'd hear myself say this but I need father's help. I need him to stand with me.
[Angelica]
 That's impossible.
[HAMILTON] No, no it's not. Not if you ask him. You know he'll listen to you.
[Angelica]
 Father's dead.
[HAMILTON] What?
[Angelica]
 He's dead. I'm the governor... Well what did you expect? After he learned what you'd done,
how you'd disgraced u,s he died... of shame. Embarrassed to death.
[HAMILTON] Good, I'm glad. It's better that way.
[Angelica]
 That's a wicked thing to say.
[HAMILTON] No, it's true. Because now it's just us. You can help me and together we can...
[Angelica]
 Elphaba, shut up! First of all, I can't harbor a fugitive, I'm an un-elected official!
And why should I help you? You fly around [Oz, trying to rescue animals you've never even met,
and not once have you ever thought to use your powers to rescue me!
ALL OF MY LIFE, I'VE DEPENDED ON YOU
HOW DO YOU THINK THAT FEELS?
ALL OF MY LIFE I'VE DEPENDED ON YOU
AND THIS HIDEOUS CHAIR WITH WHEELS!
SCROUNGING FOR SCRAPS OF PITY TO PICK UP
AND LONGING TO KICK UP
MY HEELS...
[HAMILTON] Nessa, there isn't a spell for everything! The power is mysterious.
It's not like coddling up a pair of... She Pulls Out The Grimmerie From Her Bag. Wait.
[Angelica]
 What are you doing?
Elphaba Begins Chanting.
[Angelica]
 What is that? Ah! My shoes! It feels like... like they're on fire! What have you done to my shoes???
She Lifts Her Dress, Revealing The Ruby Slippers. Nessarose Stands, But Falls. Elphaba Gives Her A Hand.
[Angelica]
 No, don't help me. She Stands.
[HAMILTON] Oh, Nessa, at last...
I'VE DONE WHAT LONG AGO I SHOULD
AND FINALLY FROM THESE POWERS SOMETHING GOOD
FINALLY SOMETHING GOOD...
[Angelica]
 LAFAYETE! LAFAYETE! Come quickly!
[HAMILTON] LAFAYETE?
[Angelica]
 LAFAYETE! Come here at once!
[HAMILTON] No! Nessa, listen, nobody can know I'm here!
Nessarose Runs Behind The Closet As LAFAYETE Enters.
[Angelica]
 Yes, what is it, Madame?
[HAMILTON] LAFAYETE...
[Angelica]
 What are you doing here? You stay back!
[HAMILTON] LAFAYETE, it's just me, I'm not going to hurt you!
[Angelica]
 No! You're lying! That's all you ever do! You and your sister! She's as wicked as you are!
[HAMILTON] What are you talking about?
[Angelica]
 I'm talking about my life. The little that's left of it. I'm not free to leave Munchkinland, none of us are.
Ever since she took power, she's been stripping the Munchkins of our rights...
and we didn't have that many to begin with! And do you know why?
Nessarose Reveals Herself In The Chair.
[Angelica]
 To keep you here, with me. But none of that matters anymore. Look.
Nessarose Stands Up.
[Angelica]
 To Elphaba. You did this for her?
[Angelica]
 For both of us!
[Angelica]
 Nessa, this changes everything.
[Angelica]
 I know.
[Angelica]

LISTEN NESSA...
[Angelica]
 What?
[Angelica]

UH NESSA, SURELY NOW I'LL MATTER LESS TO YOU
AND YOU WON'T MIND MY LEAVING HERE TONIGHT...
[Angelica]
 Leaving?
[Angelica]
 Yes...
THAT BALL THAT'S BEING STAGED
ANNOUNCING GLINDA IS ENGAGED
[Angelica]
 Glinda?
[Angelica]

YES NESSA THAT'S RIGHT!
I'VE GOT TO GO APPEAL TO HER
EXPRESS THE WAY I FEEL TO HER
Oh, Nessa, I lost my heart to Glinda from the moment I first saw her. You know that.
[Angelica]
 Lost your heart? Well, we'll see about that...
[HAMILTON] Nessa, let him go...
[Angelica]

DID YOU THINK I'D LET YOU LEAVE ME HERE FLAT?
[Angelica]
 Don't come any closer!
YOU'RE GOING TO LOSE YOUR HEART TO ME, I TELL YOU!
IF I HAVE TO... I HAVE TO...
Sees The Grimmerie.
MAGIC SPELL YOU...
She Grabs The Book.
[Angelica]
 Ah... Tum... Tah... Tae...
Elphaba Reveals Herself.
[HAMILTON] Nessa, stop!
[Angelica]
 What is she doing?!
[HAMILTON] No, Nessa, you're pronouncing the words all wrong!
[HAMILTON] Nessa!
[Angelica]
 LAFAYETE! What is it?
[Angelica]
 Gasps. My heart feels like it's... shrinking.
[Angelica]
 Elphaba, do something!
[HAMILTON] I can't! You can't reverse a spell once it's been cast!
[Angelica]
 So what do we do?
LAFAYETE Falls Into Nessa's Empty Wheel Chair. Elphaba Wheels Him Behind The Closet.
[Angelica]
 Elphaba, do something!
[Angelica]
 This is all your fault! If you hadn't shown me that horrendible book.
[HAMILTON] I have to find another spell... it's the only thing that might work. She Goes Behind The Closet As Well.
[Angelica]
 Save him, please!
JUST SAVE HIM, MY POOR LAFAYETE, MY SWEET MY BRAVE,
DON'T LEAVE ME 'TIL MY SORRY LIFE HAS CEASED...
Elphaba Wheels The Chair Out, Which Is Not Facing The Audience And Is Seen Casting A Spell.
ALL ALONE AND LOVELESS HERE
JUST THE GIRL IN THE MIRROR
JUST HER AND ME! THE WICKED WITCH OF THE EAST!
WE DESERVE EACH OTHER...
[Angelica]
 Well... what about his heart?
[HAMILTON] It's all right. He won't need one now. I have to go. I have business to attend to in the Emerald City.
Nessa, I have done everything I could for you but it has never been enough and it never will be...
She Leaves.
[Angelica]
 Elphaba, wait! Elphaba!
LAFAYETE Wakes Up.
[Angelica]
 Where am I? What happened?
[Angelica]
 Nothing, LAFAYETE, you just fell asleep... and...
He Sits Up, Squeaking. He Is Made Of Tin. Nessarose Screams.
[Angelica]
 What is it, what's wrong?
[Angelica]
 No, it wasn't me it was her! I tried to stop her.
LAFAYETE Screams Uncontrollably And Runs Off.
[Angelica]
 LAFAYETE, please listen! It was Elphaba! LAFAYETE! It was Elphaba!!!

[Hamilton]
[HAMILTON] Well you have, you have harmed me.
[Hamilton]
I realize that, and I regret it. Elphaba...
[HAMILTON] There you are! I'm setting those monkeys free! And don't try to interfere, or call the guards...
[Hamilton]
I'm not calling anyone. The truth is I'm glad to see you again. It gets pretty lonely around here. And I know you must get lonely too.
[HAMILTON] You don't know the first thing about me.
[Hamilton]
Oh, but I do. I do know you. I can't explain it exactly. You know what I mean? Elphaba, you've been so strong through all of this, aren't you tired of being the strong one? Wouldn't you like someone to take care of you? He Hands Her Back The Broom. Please, help me start again.
[HAMILTON] Don't you think I wish I could? That I could go back to the time when I believed you really were wonderful? The Wonderful Wizard of [Oz? Nobody believed in you more than I did.
[Hamilton]
Oh, my dear child...
I NEVER ASKED FOR THIS OR PLANNED IT IN ADVANCE
I WAS MERELY BLOWN HERE BY THE WINDS OF CHANCE
I NEVER SAW MYSELF AS A SOLOMON OR SOCRATES
I KNEW WHO I WAS, ONE OF YOUR DIME A D[OzEN MEDIOCRATES
THEN SUDDENLY I'M HERE, RESPECTED, WORSHIPED EVEN
JUST BECAUSE THE FOLKS IN OzNEEDED SOMEONE TO BELIEVE IN
DOES IT SURPRISE YOU I GOT HOOKED AND ALL TOO SOON
WHAT CAN I SAY? I GOT CARRIED AWAY
AND NOT JUST BY BALLOON...
WONDERFUL
THEY CALLED ME WONDERFUL
SO I SAID, WONDERFUL, IF YOU INSIST
I WILL BE WONDERFUL
AND THEY SAID WONDERFUL
BELIEVE ME IT'S HARD TO RESIST
'CUZ IT FEELS WONDERFUL
THEY THINK I'M WONDERFUL
HEY LOOK WHO'S WONDERFUL
THIS CORN-FED HICK!
WHO SAID IT MIGHT BE KEEN
TO BUILD A TOWN OF GREEN
AND A WONDERFUL ROAD OF YELLOW BRICK!
See, I never had a family of my own since I was always traveling, and I guess I just wanted to give the citizens of Ozeverything.
[HAMILTON] So you lied to them?
[Hamilton]
Only verbally. Besides, they were the lies they wanted to hear. Elphaba, where I come from we believe all sorts of things that aren't true... we call it history!
A MAN'S CALLED A TRAITOR
OR LIBERATOR
A RICH MAN'S A THIEF
OR PHILANTHROPIST
IS ONE A CRUSADER
OR RUTHLESS INVADER
IT'S ALL IN THE LABEL WHICH IS ABLE TO PERSIST
THERE ARE PRECIOUS FEW AT EASE
WITH MORAL AMBIGUITIES
SO WE ACT AS THOUGH THEY DON'T EXIST...
THEY CALL ME WONDERFUL
SO I AM
INFACT, IT'S SO MUCH WHO I AM IT'S PART OF MY NAME!
AND WITH MY HELP YOU CAN BE THE SAME...
AT LONG, LONG LAST RECEIVE YOUR DUE
LONG OVERDUE
ELPHABA, THE MOST CELEBRATED
ARE THE REHABILITATED
THERE'LL SUCH A WHOOPDEE DOO!
A CELEBRATION THROUGHOUT [Oz,
THAT'S ALL TO DO WITH YOU!
WONDERFUL, THEY'LL CALL YOU WONDERFUL!
[HAMILTON]
THAT DOES SOUND WONDERFUL!
Wizard]
TRUST ME IT'S FUN!!!
Both]
WHEN YOU ARE WONDERFUL,
IT WOULD BE WONDERFUL!
WONDERFUL, WONDERFUL
Wizard]
ONE, TWO AND...
They Dance.
[HAMILTON]
I'LL ACCEPT YOUR PROPOSITION
[Hamilton]
Wonderful
[HAMILTON]
ON ONE CONDITION
[Hamilton]
Yes?
[HAMILTON] You set those Monkeys free.
[Hamilton]
Done.

[HAMILTON] Go! Fly! You're Free! Fly! Chistery, Chistery, you're free, isn't it wonderful?! Go, fly! She Makes Her Way To Another "Monkey" Covered By A Sheet.
[Hamilton]
No! No! Please!
She Pulls Off The Cover, Revealing Dr. Dillamond.
[HAMILTON] No! It can't be! Doctor Dillamond...
[Hamilton]
Elphaba, we just couldn't keep letting him speak out...
[HAMILTON] Doctor Dillamond, are you alright? Don't be afraid. It's me, Elphaba.
[Hamilton]
 Bahhhhh.
[HAMILTON] Doctor, don't you remember me?
[Hamilton]
 Bahhhhh.
[HAMILTON] Can't you speak?
[Hamilton]
 Bahhhhh.
[HAMILTON] No... We have nothing in common. I am nothing like you and I never will be and I will fight you until the day I die!!!
The Wizard Climbs Into The Head And Dr. Dillamond Runs Offstage.

[Hamilton]
Guards, guards!!!
Fiyero Runs In With His Men.
[Guard]
 Halt!
[BURR]
 Are you alright, your [Ozness?
[HAMILTON] Fiyero!
[BURR]
 I don't believe it...
[HAMILTON] Oh , Fiyero, thank God. I thought you were...
[BURR]
 Silence witch!!!
[Guard]
 There's a Goat on the lam, sir.
[BURR]
 Never mind all that. Fetch me some... some water.
[Guard]
 Water, sir?
[BURR]
 You heard me, as much as you can carry.
Guards] Yes, sir!
They March Off.
[HAMILTON] Fiyero...
[BURR]
 I said silence!
[Hamilton]
He Runs Out Of The Head. No! No!
[BURR]
 Don't make a sound, your [Ozness, unless you want all your guests to know the truth about the Wonderful Wizard of [Oz... Elphaba, I'll find Doctor Dillamond later, no get out of here.
[HAMILTON] Fiyero, you frightened me. I thought, I though you might have changed.
[BURR]
 I have... changed.
Glinda Enters.
[Burr] What's going on... Elphie? Oh, thank Ozyou're alive! Only you shouldn't have come. If anyone discoverates you ...
[BURR]
 Glinda, you'd better go.
[Burr] Fiyero, what are you...
[BURR]
 Please, just go back to the ball.
[Burr] Your [Ozness, he means no disrespectation. Please understand! You see, we all went to school together...
[BURR]
 Elphaba!
[Burr] Fiyero, have you misplaced your mind? What are you doing?
[BURR]
 I'm going with her.
[Burr] What? What are you saying? You mean all this time... the two of you... behind my back...
[HAMILTON] No, Glinda it wasn't like that!
[BURR]
 Actually, it was...but it wasn't...Elphaba, let's go... let's go!
They Run Off.
[Burr] Fine, go! You deserve each other...
The Wizard Holds A Small Bottle With A Green Liquid.
[Hamilton]
Here, have a swig of this, it dulls the pain.
[Burr] No, thank you.
Mme. Morrible Enters, Laughing.
[Morrible]
 Oh, is it true? Your betrothed has taken her into custody?
[Hamilton]
Our new captain of the guard had other plans.
[Morrible]
 You mean she hasn't been captured?
[Hamilton]
Quite the contrary. And considering how well she eluded us last time...
[Morrible]
 Well, we'll just flush her out and force her to show herself.
[Hamilton]
But how?
[Burr] Her sister
[Morrible]
 What? What did she say?
[Burr] Use her sister. Spread a rumor. Make her think her sister is in trouble and she will fly to her side... and you'll have her.
[Hamilton]
Exactly so.
[Burr] Now, if your [Ozness will excuse me I have a slight headache, I think I'll lie down.
She Walks Out.
[Morrible]
 Yes, well...a rumor won't do it. Elphaba's too smart for that.
[Hamilton]
Far too smart.
[Morrible]
 Perhaps, a change in the weather...

[Burr]
DON'T WISH, DON'T START
WISHING ONLY WOUNDS THE HEART...
THERE'S A GIRL I KNOW, HE LOVES HER SO...
I'M NOT THAT GIRL...

Only Elphaba & Fiyero Are On Stage, In The Woods
[HAMILTON]
KISS ME TOO FIERCELY, HOLD ME TOO TIGHT
I NEED HELP BELIEVING YOU'RE WITH ME TONIGHT
MY WILDEST DREAMINGS COULD NOT FORSEE
LYING BESIDE YOU WITH YOU WANTING ME
IF JUST FOR THIS MOMENT
AS LONG AS YOU'RE MINE
I'VE LOST ALL RESISTANCE
AND CROSSED SOME BORDERLINE
AND IF IT TURNS OUT
IT'S OVER TOO FAST
I'LL MAKE EVERY LAST MOMENT LAST
AS LONG AS YOU'RE MINE...
[BURR]

MAYBE I'M BRAINLESS, MAYBE I'M WISE,
BUT YOU'VE GOT ME SEEING THROUGH DIFFERENT EYES,
SOMEHOW I'VE FALLEN UNDER YOUR SPELL
AND SOMEHOW I'M FEELING
IT'S UP THAT I FELL
Both]
EVERY MOMENT, AS LONG AS YOU'RE MINE
I'LL WAKE UP MY BODY
AND MAKE UP FOR LOST TIME
[BURR]

SAY THERE'S NO FUTURE
FOR US AS A PAIR...
Both]
AND THOUGH I MAY KNOW,
I DON'T CARE
IF JUST FOR THIS MOMENT
AS LONG AS YOU'RE MINE
COME BE HOW YOU WANT TO
AND SEE HOW BRIGHT WE SHINE!
BORROW THE MOONLIGHT
UNTIL IT IS THROUGH
AND KNOW I'LL BE HERE HOLDING YOU...
AS LONG AS YOU'RE MINE...
[BURR]
 What is it?
[HAMILTON] It's just... for the first time... I feel... wicked.

[HAMILTON] I just wish...
[BURR]
 What?
[HAMILTON] I wish I could be beautiful... for you.
[BURR]
 Elphaba...
[HAMILTON] Don't tell me that I am, you don't need to lie to me.
[BURR]
 It's not lying! It's... uh... it's looking at things another way. Someday, you and Glinda will make up and we'll all...
[HAMILTON] Shh! Listen... Do you hear that? A Shriek Is Heard In The Distance. It sounds like somebody in pain.
[BURR]
 It's just the wind.
[HAMILTON] The Siren Is Heard Again. My sister's in danger.
[BURR]
 What? How do you know?
[HAMILTON] I don't know, I just do... Gasps.
[BURR]
 Elphaba what's wrong, what is it?
[HAMILTON] This! Don't you see it?
[BURR]
 What do you mean? What do you see?
[HAMILTON] It doesn't make any sense... It's a house but it's... it's flying through the sky? I have to go to Nessa!
[BURR]
 I'll come with you!
[HAMILTON] No, you mustn't, it's too dangerous!
[BURR]
 Listen to me, listen! My family has a castle in Kiamo Ko. Now, no one is ever there except for the sentries who watch over it. We've never lived there.
[HAMILTON] Where do you live?
[BURR]
 In the other castle... It's the perfect hiding place; tunnels, secret passageways. You'll be safe there.
[HAMILTON] We will see each other again, won't we?
[BURR]
 Elphaba, we are going to be together always. You can see houses flying through the sky, can't you see that?
They Embrace And Elphaba Runs Off.
Glinda Enters. There Is A House In The Background. The Edge OF The Yellow Brick Road Can Be Seen.
[Burr] That's right, you just take that one road, the whole time. Waves offstage. Oh, I hope they don't get lost. I'm so bad at giving directions. She sees the house, picks up flowers and lays them in front of the house. Oh, Nessa.
Elphaba Appears.
[HAMILTON] What a touching display of grief.
[Burr] I don't think we have anything further to say to one another.
[HAMILTON] I wanted something to remember her by, and all that is left were those shoes, and now that wretched little farm girl has walked off with them. So I'd appreciate some time, alone, to say goodbye to my sister.
Glinda Backs Away As Elphaba Walks Toward The House.
[HAMILTON] Nessa, please, please, please forgive me...
[Burr] Elphie... you mustn't blame yourself. It's dreadful, it is, to have a house fall on you, but accidents will happen.
[HAMILTON] You call this an accident?
[Burr] Yes! Well, maybe not an accident...
[HAMILTON] Well, what do you call it?
[Burr] Well... a regime change. Caused by a bizarre and unexpected twister of fate.
[HAMILTON] You think cyclones just appear out of the blue?
[Burr] I don't know, I never really...
[HAMILTON] No, of course you never! You're too busy telling everyone how wonderful everything is!
[Burr] I'm a public figure, now. People expect me to...
[HAMILTON] Lie?
[Burr] Be encouraging! And what exactly have you been doing besides riding around on that filthy, old thing?
[HAMILTON] Well, we can't all come and go by bubble. Who's invention was that, the Wizard's? Of course, even if it wasn't I'm sure he'd still take credit for it.
[Burr] Yes, well, a lot of us are taking things that don't belong to us, aren't we?
[HAMILTON] Now wait just a clock tick! I know it may be difficult for that blissful, blonde brain of yours to comprehend that someone like him could actually choose someone like me! But it's happened... it's real. And you can wave that ridiculous wand all you want, you can't change it! He never belonged to you, he doesn't love you, and he never did! He loves me!
Glinda Slaps Her.
[HAMILTON] Cackles. Feel better now?
[Burr] Yes, I do.
[HAMILTON] Good, so do I.
She Slaps Glinda. Glinda Then Twirls Her Wand Skillfully And Elphaba Arms Herself With Her Broom. They Charge At Each Other And Then Drop Their "Weapons" And Beat Each Other Senselessly. Glinda Takes Elphaba's Hat Off Her Head And Begins To Whack Her With It. The Guards Run In.
[Guard]
 Halt! In the name of the Wizard!
They Grab Elphaba.
[HAMILTON] Stop! Let me go!
[Burr] Let me go, I almost had her!
[Guard]
 Sorry it took us so long to get here, Miss.
[HAMILTON] I can't believe you would sink this low! To use my sister's death as a trap to capture me?!
[Burr] I never meant for this to happen! Elphie!
Fiyero Swings In On A Rope.
[BURR]
 Let the green girl go!
[Burr] Fiyero, how in [Oz?
[BURR]
 I said let her go! Or explain to all Ozhow the Wizard's guards watched while Glinda the Good was slain.
[Burr] Fiyero...
[BURR]
 I said, let her go.
The Guards Release Her.
[BURR]
 Elphaba, go, now.
[HAMILTON] No, not without you.
[Burr] Fiyero, please.
[BURR]
 Hush! Now! Go!
Elphaba Hesitates.
[Burr] Do it!
She Runs Off.
[Guard]
 Seize him!
[Burr] Wait, what?! What are you doing? Stop it! In the name of goodness, stop! Don't you see? He wasn't going to harm me, he just... he just... he loves her.
[BURR]
 Glinda, I'm so sorry!
[Guard]
 Take him up to that field there! Put him on one of those poles until he tells us where the witch went.
They Drag Him Offstage.
[Burr] No, don't hurt him! Please, don't hurt him! Fiyero!!!!
[HAMILTON] Fiyero!!!!
ELEKA NAHMEN NAHMEN ATUM ATUM ELEKA NAHMEN
ELEKA NAHMEN NAHMEN ATUM ATUM ELEKA NAHMEN
LET HIS FLESH NOT BE TORN LET HIS BLOOD LEAVE NO STAIN,
WILL THEY BEAT HIM, LET HIM FEEL NO PAIN...
LET HIS BONES NEVER BREAK AND HOWEVER THEY TRY TO DESTROY HIM,
LET HIM NEVER DIE, LET HIM NEVER DIE!
ELEKA NAHMEN NAHMEN ATUM ATUM ELEKA NAHMEN
ELEKA NAHMEN NAHMEN ATUM ATUM ELEKA... ELEKA
AH! WHAT GOOD IS THIS CHANTING?
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT I'M READING
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT TRICK I OUGHT TO TRY!
FIYERO WHERE ARE YOU?! ALREADY DEAD OR BLEEDING?
ONE MORE DISASTER I CAN ADD TO MY GENEROUS SUPPLY!
NO GOOD DEED GOES UNPUNISHED
NO ACT OF CHARITY GOES UNRESENTED
NO GOOD DEED GOES UNPUNISHED
THAT'S MY NEW CREED
MY ROAD OF GOOD INTENTIONS
LED WHERE SUCH ROADS ALWAYS LEAD
NO GOOD DEED
GOES UNPUNISHED!
NESSA...
DOCTOR DILLAMOND...
FIYERO...
FIYERO!!!
ONE QUESTION HAUNTS AND HURTS
TOO MUCH, TOO MUCH TO MENTION
WAS I REALLY SEEKING GOOD
OR JUST SEEKING ATTENTION?
IS THAT ALL GOOD DEEDS ARE WHEN LOOKED AT WITH AN ICE COLD EYE?
IF THAT'S ALL GOOD DEEDS ARE
MAYBE THAT'S THE REASON WHY
NO GOOD DEED GOES UNPUNISHED
ALL HELPFUL URGES SHOULD BE CIRCUMVENTED
NO GOOD DEED GOES UNPUNISHED
SURE, I MEANT WELL, WELL LOOK AT WHAT WELL MEANT DID!
ALRIGHT, ENOUGH, SO BE IT!
SO BE IT THEN...
LET ALL OF OzBE AGREED
I'M WICKED THROUGH AND THROUGH
SINCE I COULD NOT SUCCEED
FIYERO SAVING YOU
I PROMISE NO GOOD DEED WILL I ATTEMPT TO DO AGAIN
EVER AGAIN!
NO GOOD DEAD, WILL I DO
AGAIN!!!!!!!!

[Ozia]

GO! AND HUNT HER AND FIND HER AND KILL HER!
Vicious Woman] Good fortune, witch hunters!

[Ozia]

GO! AND HUNT HER AND FIND HER AND KILL HER!
Rabid Man] Kill the witch!
[Ozia]

WICKEDNESS MUST BE PUNISHED
EVIL EFFECTIVELY ELIMINATED
WICKEDNESS MUST BE PUNISHED
KILL THE WITCH!
[Angelica]
 And, this is more than just a service to the Wizard. I have a personal score to settle with Elph... with the witch! Crowd Cheers.
IT'S DUE TO HER I'M MADE OF TIN
HER SPELL MADE THIS OCCUR
SO FOR ONCE I'M GLAD I'M HEARTLESS
I'LL BE HEARTLESS KILLING HER!
And I am not the only one. Looks Offstage. Oh, come on, you! Come out and tell them what she did to you in class that day. How you were just a cub and she cubnapped you.
Lion] No!
[Angelica]

YOU SEE THE LION ALSO
HAS A GRIEVANCE TO REPAY (Lion Roars)
IF SHE'D LET HIM FIGHT HIS OWN BATTLES WHEN HE WAS YOUNG,
HE WOULDN'T BE A COWARD TODAY!

[Burr] No, no, that's not the way it happened! Madame, you've got to stop this, it's gone too far!
[Morrible]
 Oh, I think Elphaba can take care of herself.
[Burr] Madame, something's been troubling me about Nessarose and that cyclone.
[Morrible]
 Oh yes... well, I guess it was just her time.
[Burr] Was it? Or did you...
[Morrible]
 After A Pause. Now, you listen to me, Missy, you may have fooled the rest of Ozwith this "aren't I good" routine, but you know better. You've wanted this since the beginning... and now you're getting what you wanted. So just smile and wave and shut up! Good fortune, good fortune witch hunters!
Rapid Man] Kill her!
Vicious Woman] Kill the witch!
WICKEDNESS MUST BE PUNISHED
BRAVE WITCH HUNTERS I WOULD JOIN YOU IF I COULD
BECAUSE WICKEDNESS MUST BE PUNISHED...
PUNISHED... PUNISHED...
BUT GOOD!!!
[HAMILTON] Oh, for [Oz's sake, stop crying!!! I can't listen to it anymore! Oh, you want to see your Aunt Em and your Uncle What's-his-name again?! Then get those shoes off your feet!!! Little brat... takes a dead woman's shoes; must have been raised in a barn! Chistery! Oh, Chistery, there you are. Where are the others? Chistery motions away. Chistery, please... if you don't at least try to keep speaking you will never... She Sees Glinda. Go away.
[Burr] They're coming for you.
[HAMILTON] Go away!
[Burr] Let the little girl go, and that poor little dog... Dodo.
[Burr] I know you don't want to hear this, but someone has to say it... You are out of control! I mean, come on! They're just shoes, let it go! Elphaba, you can't go on like this.
[HAMILTON] I can do anything I want. I am the Wicked Witch of the West! Another monkey Brings Her A Letter. At last! What took you so long? She Reads It. What's this? Why are you bothering me with this? She Reads On.
[Burr] What is it? What's wrong? It's Fiyero, isn't it? Is he...
[HAMILTON] We've seen his face for the last time.
[Burr] Oh no!
[HAMILTON] You're right... It's time I surrender. Carries A Bucket.
[Burr] Elphie.... Elphie, what is it?
[HAMILTON] You can't be found here! You must go. Refers To A Corner
[Burr] No.
[HAMILTON] You must leave.
[Burr] No! Elphie, I'll tell them everything.
[HAMILTON] No! They'll only turn against you.
[Burr] I don't care!
[HAMILTON] I do! Promise me, promise me, you won't try to clear my name... promise.
[Burr] Alright... I promise. But I don't understand.

[HAMILTON] Well then, you'll have to learn
NOW IT'S UP TO YOU
FOR BOTH OF US
NOW IT'S UP TO YOU
[HAMILTON] You're the only friend I've ever had.
[Burr] And I've had so many friends... but only one that mattered.

[Burr]
I'VE HEARD IT SAID
THAT PEOPLE COME INTO OUR LIVES FOR A REASON
BRINGING SOMETHING WE MUST LEARN
AND WE ARE LED TO THOSE
WHO HELP US MOST TO GROW
IF WE LET THEM
AND WE HELP THEM IN RETURN
WELL, I DON'T KNOW IF I BELIEVE THAT'S TRUE
BUT I KNOW I'M WHO I AM TODAY
BECAUSE I KNEW YOU
LIKE A COMMIT PULLED FROM ORBIT,
AS IT PASSES A SUN
LIKE A STREAM THAT MEETS A BOULDER
HALF WAY THROUGH THE WOOD
WHO CAN SAY IF I'VE BEEN CHANGED FOR THE BETTER?
BUT, BECAUSE I KNEW YOU...
I HAVE BEEN CHANGED

IT WELL MAY BE,
THAT WE WILL NEVER MEET AGAIN
IN THIS LIFETIME
SO LET ME SAY BEFORE WE PART

YOU'LL BE WITH ME
LIKE A HANDPRINT ON MY HEART...
AND NOW WHATEVER WAY OUR STORIES END
I KNOW YOU HAVE RE-WRITTEN MINE
BY BEING MY FRIEND...
LIKE A SHIP BLOWN FROM IT'S MOORING
BY A WIND OFF THE SEA
LIKE A SEA DROP BY A SKY BIRD
IN A DISTANT WOOD
WHO CAN SAY IF I'VE BEEN CHANGED FOR THE BETTER?
BUT BECAUSE I KNEW YOU
[Burr]
BECAUSE I KNEW YOU
Both]
I HAVE BEEN CHANGED...
FOR GOOD...

AND JUST TO CLEAR THE AIR
I ASK FORGIVNESS FOR THE THINGS I'VE DONE
YOU BLAME ME FOR.
[Burr]
BUT THEN I GUESS, WE KNOW THERE'S BLAME TO SHARE
Both]
AND NONE OF IT SEEMS TO MATTER ANYMORE!
[Burr] LIKE A COMET PULLED FROM ORBIT AS IT PASSES A SUN...
[HAMILTON] LIKE A SHIP BLOWN FROM ITS MOORING BY A WIND OFF THE SEA
[Burr] LIKE A STREAM THAT MEETS A BOULDER
[HAMILTON] LIKE A SEA DROP BY A BIRD
[Burr] HALFWAY THROUGH THE WOOD
[HAMILTON] IN THE WOOD
[Burr]
WHO CAN SAY IF I'VE BEEN CHANGED FOR THE BETTER?
Both]
I DO BELIEVE I HAVE BEEN CHANGED FOR THE BETTER.
[Burr]
AND, BECAUSE I KNEW YOU
[HAMILTON]
BECAUSE I KNEW YOU
Both]
BECAUSE I KNEW YOU
I HAVE BEEN CHANGED
FOR GOOD...


[HAMILTON] You have to hide. No one can know you were here. Hide yourself!
Elphaba Drapes A Scrim Around The Stage
Offstage Chorus of Women]
AND GOODNESS KNOWS
THE WICKED'S LIVES ARE LONELY
GOODNESS KNOWS THE WICKED DIE ALONE...
LAFAYETE and Other Witch Hunters Run In. You Can See The Silhouette Of The Action Happening Behind The Scrim. Glinda Is Downstage Watching The Action Take Place.
The Mob Surrounds The Witch And She Melts With A Scream The Mob Leaves And Glinda Comes Out From Hiding. She Moves Near The Scrim.
[Burr] Elphie? Elphie? Chistery opens the scrim, where just Elphaba's hat and the green bottle remain. Glinda cries, and grabs the had, holding it against her.
Chistery] Handing Her The Bottle. Miss, Miss Glinda.
[Morrible]
 Well, I don't know why you're so despondiary, I thought it went quite well! They seem thrilled to shreds with their brains and their hearts, and this and that.... Glinda Enters. Oh, Miss Glinda! I thought you'd be out festivating.
[Burr] This was Elphaba's. Holding Out The Bottle.
[Hamilton]
What's that you say?
[Burr] It was a keepsake. It was her mother's. She told me so herself.
I've only seen a little, green bottle like this one other time. It was right here, in this very room. You offered me a drink from it.
Lover's Song Played In Background.
[Hamilton]
But... oh my Lord...
I AM A SENTIMENTAL MAN
WHO ALWAYS LONGED TO BE...
a father...
[Morrible]
 So that was it. That's why she had such powers! She was a child of both worlds!
[Hamilton]
He Cries.
[Burr] I want you to leave [Oz. I'll make the pronouncement myself]
that the strains of wizardship have been too much for you and you are taking an indefinite leave of absence! Did you hear what I said?!
[Hamilton]
Yes, your goodness.
[Burr] You'd better go get your balloon ready. Guards!
He Exits.
[Morrible]
 Glinda, dear, I know we've had our miniscule differentiations in the past...
[Burr] Guards! Madame, have you ever considered how you'd fare in captivity?
[Morrible]
 What?
[Burr] Articulated. Captivity... prison! Personally, I don't think you'll hold up very well.
My professional opinion is that you do not have what it takes. I hope you prove me wrong.
I doubt you will. Take her away!
[Morrible]
 No!!!!

[Ozia]

GOOD NEWS! SHE'S DEAD!
THE WITCH OF THE WEST IS DEAD!
THE WICKEDEST WITCH THERE EVER WAS
THE ENEMY OF ALL OF US, HERE IN [Oz,
IS DEAD!
GOOD NEWS
GOOD NEWS!!!
The Scarecrow (Fiyero) Walks On Stage. He Bends Down & Knocks On A Trap Door In The Floor.
[BURR]
 It worked!
He Opens The Door & Elphaba Climbs Out.
[HAMILTON] Fiyero! I thought you'd never get here.
She Touches His Straw Face.
[BURR]
 Go ahead, touch, I don't mind. Ah, you did the best you could. You saved my life.
[HAMILTON] You're still beautiful.
[BURR]
 You don't have to lie to me.
[HAMILTON] It's not lying... its looking at things another way.
[Ozia]

NO ONE MOURNS THE WICKED
NOW AT LAST SHE'S DEAD AND GONE!
NOW AT LAST THERE'S JOY THROUGHOUT THE LAND!
[Burr] Fellow [Ozians, friends, we have been through a frightening time. There will be other times
and other things that frighten us. But if you let me, I'd like to try to help. I'd like to try to be... Glinda the Good.
[Ozia]

GOOD NEWS!!
[BURR]
 It's time to go.
[HAMILTON] We can never come back to [Oz, can we?
[BURR]
 No.
[HAMILTON] I only wish...
[BURR]
 What?
[HAMILTON] Glinda could know that we're alive.
[BURR]
 She can't know, not if we want to be safe. No one can ever know.
[Ozia]

GOOD NEWS...
[BURR]
 Come...
[Burr]
WHO CAN SAY IF I'VE BEEN CHANGED FOR THE BETTER? BUT...
Elphaba & [Burr]
BECAUSE I KNEW YOU...
[Ozia]

NO ONE MOURNS THE WICKED...
[Burr]
BECAUSE I KNEW YOU...
Elphaba & [Burr]
I HAVE BEEN CHANGED...
Fiyero and Elphaba Leave Through The Clock

Aaron Burr, Sir

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[COMPANY]
1776. New York City

[HAMILTON]
Pardon me. Are you Aaron Burr, sir?

[BURR]
That depends. Who's asking?

[HAMILTON]
Oh, well, sure, sir
I'm Alexander Hamilton, I'm at your service, sir
I have been looking for you

[BURR]
I'm getting nervous

[HAMILTON]
Sir...
I heard your name at Princeton. I was seeking an accelerated course of study when I got sort of out of sorts with a buddy of yours. I may have punched him. It's a blur, sir. He handles the financials?

[BURR]
You punched the bursar

[HAMILTON]
Yes!
I wanted to do what you did. Graduate in two, then join the revolution. He looked at me like I was stupid, I'm not stupid

So how'd you do it? How'd you graduate so fast?

[BURR]
It was my parents' dying wish before they passed

[HAMILTON]
You're an orphan. Of course! I'm an orphan
God, I wish there was a war!
Then we could prove that we're worth more
Than anyone bargained for...

[BURR]
Can I buy you a drink?

[HAMILTON]
That would be nice

[BURR]
While we're talking, let me offer you some free advice
Talk less

[HAMILTON]
What?

[BURR]
Smile more

[HAMILTON]
Ha

[BURR]
Don't let them know what you're against or what you're for

[HAMILTON]
You can't be serious

[BURR]
You wanna get ahead?

[HAMILTON]
Yes

[BURR]
Fools who run their mouths off wind up dead

[LAURE]

Yo yo yo yo yo!
What time is it?

[LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
Show time!

[BURR]

[LAURE]

Show time! Show time! Yo!
I'm John Laurens in the place to be!
Two pints o' Sam Adams, but I'm workin' on three, uh!
Those redcoats don't want it with me!
Cuz I will pop chick-a pop these cops till I'm free!

[LAFAYETTE]
Oui oui, mon ami, je m'appelle Lafayette!
The Lancelot of the revolutionary set!
I came from afar just to say "Bonsoir!"
Tell the King "Casse toi!" Who's the best?
C'est moi!

[MULLIGAN]
Brrrah brraaah! I am Hercules Mulligan
Up in it, lovin' it, yes I heard ya mother said "Come again?"
Lock up ya daughters and horses, of course
It's hard to have intercourse over four sets of corsets...

[LAURE]

No more sex, pour me another brew, son!
Let's raise a couple more...

[LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
To the revolution!

[LAURE]

Well, if it ain't the prodigy of Princeton college!

[MULLIGAN]
Aaron Burr!

[LAURE]

Give us a verse, drop some knowledge!

[BURR]
Good luck with that] you're takin' a stand
You spit. I'm ‘a sit. We'll see where we land

[LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
Boooo!

[LAURE]

Burr, the revolution's imminent. What do you stall for?

[HAMILTON]
If you stand for nothing, Burr, what'll you fall for?
[LAURE]

Ooh
Who are you? [MULLIGAN]

My Shot

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[HAMILTON]
I am not throwing away my shot!
I am not throwing away my shot!
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot!
I'm ‘a get a scholarship to King's College
I prob'ly shouldn't brag, but dag, I amaze and astonish
The problem is I got a lot of brains but no polish
I gotta holler just to be heard
With every word, I drop knowledge!
I'm a diamond in the rough, a shiny piece of coal
Tryin' to reach my goal. My power of speech] unimpeachable
Only nineteen but my mind is older
These New York City streets get colder, I shoulder
Ev'ry burden, ev'ry disadvantage
I have learned to manage, I don't have a gun to brandish
I walk these streets famished
The plan is to fan this spark into a flame
But damn, it's getting dark, so let me spell out the name
I am the-

[HAMILTON/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN/LAURE]

A-L-E-X-A-N-D
E-R-we are-meant to be...

[HAMILTON]
A colony that runs independently
Meanwhile, Britain keeps shittin' on us endlessly
Essentially, they tax us relentlessly
Then King George turns around, runs a spending spree
He ain't ever gonna set his descendants free
So there will be a revolution in this century
Enter me!

[LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN/LAURE]

(He says in parentheses)

[HAMILTON]
Don't be shocked when your hist'ry book mentions me
I will lay down my life if it sets us free
Eventually, you'll see my ascendancy
[HAMILTON]
And I am not throwing away
My shot
I am not throwing away
My shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot
[LAURE]

My shot!

My shot!

And I'm not throwing away my shot.

[HAMILTON/MULLIGAN/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE]
I am not throwing away my shot
I am not throwing away my shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot
It's time to take a shot!

[LAFAYETTE]
I dream of life without a monarchy
The unrest in France will lead to ‘onarchy?
‘Onarchy? How you say, how you say, ‘anarchy?'
When I fight, I make the other side panicky
With my-

[HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
Shot!

[MULLIGAN]
Yo, I'm a tailor's apprentice
And I got y'all knuckleheads in loco parentis
I'm joining the rebellion cuz I know it's my chance
To socially advance, instead of sewin' some pants!
I'm gonna take a-

[HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
Shot!

[LAURE]

But we'll never be truly free
Until those in bondage have the same rights as you and me
You and I. Do or die. Wait till I sally in
On a stallion with the first black battalion
Have another-

[HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
Shot!

[BURR]
Geniuses, lower your voices
You keep out of trouble and you double your choices
I'm with you, but the situation is fraught
You've got to be carefully taught]
If you talk, you're gonna get shot!

[HAMILTON]
Burr, check what we got
Mister Lafayette, hard rock like Lancelot
I think your pants look hot
Laurens, I like you a lot
Let's hatch a plot blacker than the kettle callin' the pot...
What are the odds the gods would put us all in one spot
Poppin' a squat on conventional wisdom, like it or not
A bunch of revolutionary manumission abolitionists?
Give me a position, show me where the ammunition is!

Oh, am I talkin' too loud?
Sometimes I get over excited, shoot off at the mouth
I never had a group of friends before
I promise that I'll make y'all proud

[LAURE]

Let's get this guy in front of a crowd

[HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN/ENSEMBLE]
I am not throwing away my shot
I am not throwing away my shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot

I am not throwing away my shot
I am not throwing away my shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry

Ev'rybody sing]
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Hey!

Wooh!!

Whoa! Whoa!

[HAMILTON]
I imagine death so much it feels more like a memory
When's it gonna get me?
In my sleep? Seven feet ahead of me?
If I see it comin', do I run or do I let it be?
Is it like a beat without a melody?
See, I never thought I'd live past twenty
Where I come from some get half as many
Ask anybody why we livin' fast and we laugh, reach for a flask
We have to make this moment last, that's plenty

Scratch that
This is not a moment, it's the movement
Where all the hungriest brothers with
Something to prove went?
Foes oppose us, we take an honest stand
We roll like Moses, claimin' our promised land
And? If we win our independence?
‘Zat a guarantee of freedom for our descendants?
Or will the blood we shed begin an endless
Cycle of vengeance and death with no defendants?
I know the action in the street is excitin'
But Jesus, between all the bleedin' ‘n fightin'
I've been readin' ‘n writin'
We need to handle our financial situation
Are we a nation of states? What's the state of our nation?
I'm past patiently waitin'. I'm passionately
Smashin' every expectation
Every action's an act of creation!
I'm laughin' in the face of casualties and sorrow
For the first time, I'm thinkin' past tomorrow

[HAMILTON AND COMPANY]
And I am not throwing away my shot

There's nothing rich folks love more

They pull up in their carriages and gawk
At the students in the common
Just to watch them talk
Take Philip Schuyler] the man is loaded
Uh-oh, but little does he know that
His daughters, Peggy, Angelica, Eliza
Sneak into the city just to watch all the guys at-

Why you slummin' in the city in your fancy heels
You searchin for an urchin who can give you ideals?

Ah, so you've discussed me
I'm a trust fund, baby, you can trust me!

Farmer Refuted

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[SEABURY]
Hear ye, hear ye! My name is Samuel Seabury
And I present "Free Thoughts on the
Proceedings of the Continental Congress!"
Heed not the rabble who scream revolution
They have not your interests at heart

[MULLIGAN]
Oh my God. Tear this dude apart

[SEABURY]
Chaos and bloodshed are not a solution
Don't let them lead you astray
This Congress does not speak for me

[BURR]
Let him be

[SEABURY]
They're playing a dangerous game
I pray the king shows you his mercy
For shame, for shame...
[HAMILTON]
Yo!
He'd have you all unravel at the
Sound of screams but the
Revolution is comin'
The have-nots are gonna
Win this
It's hard to listen to you with a straight face

Chaos and bloodshed already haunt us, honestly you shouldn't even talk. And what about Boston? Look at the cost, n' all that we've lost n' you talk
About Congress?!

My dog speaks more eloquently than thee!

But strangely, your mange is the same

Is he in Jersey?

For the revolution!
[SEABURY]
Heed not the rabble
Who scream
Revolution, they
Have not your
Interests
At heart

Chaos and bloodshed are
Not a
Solution. Don't
Let them lead you
Astray
This Congress does not
Speak for me

They're playing a dangerous game

I pray the king shows you his mercy

For shame

For shame,

[COMPANY]
For the revolution!

[SEABURY]
Heed-

[HAMILTON]
If you repeat yourself again I'm gonna-

[SEABURY/HAMILTON]
Scream-

[HAMILTON]
Honestly, look at me, please don't read!

[SEABURY]
Not your interests-

[HAMILTON]
Don't modulate the key then not debate with me!
Why should a tiny island across the sea regulate the price of tea?

[BURR]
Alexander, please!

[HAMILTON]
Burr, I'd rather be divisive than indecisive, drop the niceties

[ENSEMBLE]
Silence! A message from the King!
A message from the King!

You'll Be Back

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[KING GEORGE]
You say
The price of my love's not a price that you're willing to pay
You cry
In your tea which you hurl in the sea when you see me go by
Why so sad?
Remember we made an arrangement when you went away
Now you're making me mad
Remember, despite our estrangement, I'm your man
You'll be back
Soon you'll see
You'll remember you belong to me
You'll be back
Time will tell
You'll remember that I served you well
Oceans rise
Empires fall
We have seen each other through it all
And when push
Comes to shove
I will send a fully armed battalion
To remind you of my love!

Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da
Da da dat dat da ya da!
Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da
Da da dat dat da...

You say our love is draining and you can't go on
You'll be the one complaining when I am gone...
And no, don't change the subject
Cuz you're my favorite subject
My sweet, submissive subject
My loyal, royal subject
Forever and ever and ever and ever and ever...

You'll be back
Like before
I will fight the fight and win the war
For your love
For your praise
And I'll love you till my dying days
When you're gone
I'll go mad
So don't throw away this thing we had

Cuz when push comes to shove
I will kill your friends and family to remind you of my love
Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da
Da da dat dat da ya da!
Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da
Da da dat-
Everybody!

[ENSEMBLE]
Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da
Da da dat dat da ya da!
Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da da da da
Dat dat da ya da!

As a kid in the Caribbean I wished for a war
I knew that I was poor
I knew it was the only way to-

[HAMILTON/BURR/MULLIGAN/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE]
Rise up!

[HAMILTON]
If they tell my story
I am either gonna die on the battlefield in glory or-

[HAMILTON/BURR/MULLIGAN/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE]
Rise up!

[HAMILTON]
We will fight for this land
But there's only one man
Who can give us a command so we can-

[HAMILTON/BURR/MULLIGAN/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE]
Rise up!

Understand? It's the only way to-

We gotta make an all out stand
Ayo, I'm gonna need a right-hand man.
ENSEMBLE
What?

What?

Buck, buck, buck, buck, buck!

Buck, buck, buck, buck, buck!

[WASHINGTON]
Check it-
Can I be real a second?
For just a millisecond?
Let down my guard and tell the people how I feel a second?
Now I'm the model of a modern major general
The venerated Virginian veteran whose men are all
Lining up, to put me up on a pedestal
Writin' letters to relatives
Embellishin' my elegance and eloquence
But the elephant is in the room
The truth is in ya face when ya hear the British cannons go...

[ENSEMBLE]
Boom!

[WASHINGTON]
Any hope of success is fleeting
How can I keep leading when the people I'm
Leading keep retreating?
We put a stop to the bleeding as the British take Brooklyn
Knight takes rook, but look
[WASHINGTON]
We are outgunned

Outmanned

Outnumbered
Outplanned

We gotta make an all out stand
Ayo, I'm gonna need a right-hand man

Incoming!
[ENSEMBLE]

Buck, buck, buck, buck, buck!

Buck, buck, buck, buck, buck!

[MULLIGAN]

[HAMILTON]
We gotta stop ‘em and rob ‘em of their advantages

[MULLIGAN]

[HAMILTON]
Let's take a stand with the stamina God has granted us
Hamilton won't abandon ship
Yo, let's steal their cannons-
[MULLIGAN]
Shh-boom! [COMPANY]
Boom!

[WASHINGTON]
Goes the cannon, watch the blood and the shit spray and...

[COMPANY]
Boom!

[WASHINGTON]
Goes the cannon, we're abandonin' Kips Bay and...

[COMPANY]
Boom!

[WASHINGTON]
There's another ship and...

[COMPANY]
Boom!

[WASHINGTON]
We just lost the southern tip and...

[COMPANY]
Boom!

[WASHINGTON]
We gotta run to Harlem quick, we can't afford another slip
Guns and horses giddyup
I decide to divvy up
My forces, they're skittish as the British cut the city up
This close to giving up, facing mad scrutiny
I scream in the face of this mass mutiny]
Are these the men with which I am to defend America?
We ride at midnight, Manhattan in the distance
I cannot be everywhere at once, people
I'm in dire need of assistance...

[BURR]
Your excellency, sir!

[WASHINGTON]
Who are you?

[BURR]
Aaron Burr, Sir?
Permission to state my case?

[WASHINGTON]
As you were

[BURR]
Sir
I was a captain under General Montgomery
Until he caught a bullet in the neck in Quebec
And well, in summary
I think that I could be of some assistance
I admire how you keep firing on the British
From a distance

[WASHINGTON]
Huh

[BURR]
I have some questions, a couple of suggestions on how to fight instead of fleeing west

[WASHINGTON]
Yes?

[BURR]
Well-

[HAMILTON]
Your excellency, you wanted to see me?

[WASHINGTON]
Hamilton, come in, have you met Burr?

[HAMILTON]
Yes, sir

[HAMILTON AND BURR]
We keep meeting

[BURR]
As I was saying, sir, I look forward to seeing your strategy play out

[WASHINGTON]
Burr?

[BURR]
Sir?

[WASHINGTON]
Close the door on your way out

[HAMILTON]
Have I done something wrong, sir?

[WASHINGTON]
On the contrary
I called you here because our odds are beyond scary
Your reputation precedes you, but I have to laugh

[HAMILTON]
Sir?

[WASHINGTON]
Hamilton, how come no one can get you on their staff?

[HAMILTON]
Sir!

[WASHINGTON]
Don't get me wrong, you're a young man, of great renown
I know you stole British cannons when we were still downtown
Nathaniel Green and Henry Knox wanted to hire you...

[HAMILTON]
To be their Secretary? I don't think so

[WASHINGTON]
Why're you upset?

[HAMILTON]
I'm not-

[WASHINGTON]
It's alright, you want to fight, you've got a hunger
I was just like you when I was younger
Head full of fantasies of dyin' like a martyr?

[HAMILTON]
Yes

[WASHINGTON]
Dying is easy, young man. Living is harder

[HAMILTON]
Why are you telling me this?

[WASHINGTON]
I'm being honest
I'm working with a third of what our Congress has promised
We are a powder keg about to explode
I need someone like you to lighten the load. So?

[COMPANY (EXCEPT HAMILTON)]
I am not throwin' away my shot!
I am not throwin' away my shot!
Ayo, I'm just like my country, I'm young
Scrappy and hungry!

[HAMILTON]
I am not throwing away my shot!

[WASHINGTON]
Son

[WASHINGON AND COMPANY]
We are outgunned, outmanned!

[HAMILTON]
You need all the help you can get
I have some friends. Laurens, Mulligan
Marquis de Lafayette, okay, what else?

[WASHINGTON AND COMPANY]
Outnumbered, outplanned!

[HAMILTON]
We'll need some spies on the inside
Some King's men who might let some things slide
[HAMILTON]
I'll write to Congress and tell ‘em we need supplies, you rally the guys, master the element of surprise

I'll rise above my station, organize your information, ‘til we rise to the occasion of our new nation. Sir!

[ENSEMBLE]
Here comes the General!

A Winter's Ball

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[BURR]
How does the bastard, orphan, son of a whore
Go on and on
Grow into more of a phenomenon?
Watch this obnoxious, arrogant, loudmouth bother
Be seated at the right hand of the father
Washington hires Hamilton right on sight
But Hamilton still wants to fight, not write
Now Hamilton's skill with a quill is undeniable
But what do we have in common? We're
Reliable with the

[ALL MEN]
Ladies!

[BURR]
There are so many to deflower!

[ALL MEN]
Ladies!

[BURR]
Looks! Proximity to power

They delighted and distracted him
Martha Washington named her feral tomcat after him!

[HAMILTON]
That's true

[FULL COMPANY]
1780

[BURR]
A winter's ball
And the Schuyler sisters are the envy of all
Yo, if you can marry a sister, you're rich, son

Is it a question of if, Burr, or which one?

Helpless

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[HAMILTON/BURR/LAURENS/ALL WOMEN (EXCEPT ELIZA)]
Hey hey hey hey
[ELIZA]
Ohh, I do I do I do I
Dooo! Hey!
Ohh, I do I do I do I
Dooo! Boy you got me [ALL WOMEN]
Hey hey hey hey
Hey hey hey hey
Hey hey hey hey
Hey hey hey

[ELIZA AND WOMEN]
Helpless!
Look into your eyes, and the sky's the limit I'm helpless!
Down for the count, and I'm drownin' in ‘em

[ELIZA]
I have never been the type to try and grab the spotlight
We were at a revel with some rebels on a hot night
Laughin' at my sister as she's dazzling the room
Then you walked in and my heart went "Boom!"
Tryin' to catch your eye from the side of the ballroom
Everybody's dancin' and the band's top volume

[ELIZA AND WOMEN]
Grind to the rhythm as we wine and dine
[ELIZA]
Grab my sister, and
Whisper, "Yo, this
One's mine."

My sister made her way across the room to you
And I got nervous, thinking "What's she gonna do?"
She grabbed you by the arm, I'm thinkin' "I'm through"
Then you look back at me and suddenly I'm
Helpless!

Oh, look at those eyes

Oh!
Yeah, I'm
Helpless, I know

I'm so into you
I am so into you

I know I'm down for the count
And I'm drownin' in ‘em.

[ALL WOMEN]
Oooh

Oooh

Oooh

Oooh

Helpless!

Look into your eyes
And the sky's the limit
I'm
Helpless!
Down for the count
And I'm drownin' in ‘em

I'm helpless!

Look into your eyes
And the sky's the limit I'm helpless!

Down for the count
And I'm drownin' in ‘em.

[HAMILTON]
Where are you taking me?

[ANGELICA]
I'm about to change your life

[HAMILTON]
Then by all means, lead the way

[ELIZA]
Elizabeth Schuyler. It's a pleasure to meet you

[HAMILTON]
Schuyler?

[ANGELICA]
My sister

[ELIZA]
Thank you for all your service

[HAMILTON]
If it takes fighting a war for us to meet, it will have been worth it

[ANGELICA]
I'll leave you to it

[ELIZA AND WOMEN]
One week later

[ELIZA]
I'm writin' a letter nightly
Now my life gets better, every letter that you write me
Laughin' at my sister, cuz she wants to form a harem

[ANGELICA]
I'm just sayin', if you really loved me, you would share him
[ELIZA]
Ha!
Two weeks later
In the living room stressin'
My father's stone-faced
While you're asking for his blessin'
I'm dying inside, as
You wine
And dine
And I'm tryin' not to cry
‘cause there's nothing that your mind can't do
My father makes his way across the room
To you
I panic for a second, thinking
"we're through"
But then he shakes your hand and says
"Be true"
And you turn back to me, smiling, and I'm
Helpless!

Helpless!
Hoo!

That boy is mine
That boy is mine!

Helpless! Helpless!
Down for the count
And I'm drownin' in em

[ALL WOMEN]
Stressin'

Blessin'

Oooh

Oooh

Oooh

Oooh

Look into your eyes
And the sky's the

Down for the count
And I'm drownin' in
‘em I'm
Helpless!

Look into your eyes
And the sky's the
Limit I'm
Helpless!
Down for the count
And I'm drownin' in em

[HAMILTON]
Eliza, I don't have a dollar to my name
An acre of land, a troop to command, a dollop of fame
All I have's my honor, a tolerance for pain
A couple of college credits and my top-notch brain
Insane, your family brings out a different side of me
Peggy confides in me, Angelica tried to take a bite of me
No stress, my love for you is never in doubt
We'll get a little place in Harlem and we'll figure it out
I've been livin' without a family since I was a child
My father left, my mother died, I grew up buckwild
But I'll never forget my mother's face, that was real
And long as I'm alive, Eliza, swear to God
You'll never feel so...

[HAMILTON]
Eliza...

I've never felt so-

My life is gon' be fine cuz Eliza's in it.
[ELIZA]
I do I do I do I do!

I do I do I do I do!

Hey, yeah, yeah!

I'm down for the count
I'm-

I look into your eyes, and the sky's the limit
I'm

...drownin' in ‘em. [ALL WOMEN]
Helpless!

Helpless!

Helpless!

Down for the count
And I'm drownin' in ‘em

Satisfied

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[LAURE]

Alright, alright. That's what I'm talkin' about!
Now everyone give it up for the maid of honor
Angelica Schuyler!
[ANGELICA]
A toast to the groom!

To the bride!

From your sister

Who is always by your side

To your union

And the hope that you provide

May you always...

Be satisfied.

[ALL MEN]
To the groom!
To the groom!
To the groom!

To the bride!
To the bride!

Angelica!
Angelica!
Angelica!

By your side!

To the union!
To the revolution!

You provide!
You provide!

[HAMILTON AND MEN]
Always-

Rewind-

[ALL WOMEN]
To the groom!

To the bride!

To the bride!

[ELIZA AND WOMEN]
Angelica!

By your side!

To the union!
To the revolution!

You provide!

Always-

Rewind-

[ANGELICA]
I remember that night, I just might
Regret that night for the rest of my days

I remember those soldier boys
Tripping over themselves to win our praise

I remember that dreamlike candlelight
Like a dream that you can't quite place

But Alexander, I'll never forget the first
Time I saw your face

I have never been the same
Intelligent eyes in a hunger-pang frame
And when you said "Hi," I forgot my dang name
Set my heart aflame, ev'ry part aflame

[FULL COMPANY]
This is not a game...

[HAMILTON]
You strike me as a woman who has never been satisfied

[ANGELICA]
I'm sure I don't know what you mean. You forget yourself

[HAMILTON]
You're like me. I'm never satisfied

[ANGELICA]
Is that right?

[HAMILTON]
I have never been satisfied

[ANGELICA]
My name is Angelica Schuyler

[HAMILTON]
Alexander Hamilton

[ANGELICA]
Where's your fam'ly from?

[HAMILTON]
Unimportant. There's a million things I haven't done but
Just you wait, just you wait...

[ANGELICA]
So so so-
So this is what it feels like to match wits
With someone at your level! What the hell is the catch? It's
The feeling of freedom, of seein' the light
It's Ben Franklin with a key and a kite! You see it, right?
The conversation lasted two minutes, maybe three minutes
Ev'rything we said in total agreement, it's
A dream and it's a bit of a dance
A bit of a posture, it's a bit of a stance. He's a
Bit of a flirt, but I'm ‘a give it a chance
I asked about his fam'ly, did you see his answer?
His hands started fidgeting, he looked askance?
He's penniless, he's flying by the seat of his pants

Handsome, boy, does he know it!
Peach fuzz, and he can't even grow it!
I wanna take him far away from this place
Then I turn and see my sister's face and she is...

[ELIZA]
Helpless...

[ANGELICA]
And I know she is...

[ELIZA]
Helpless...

[ANGELICA]
And her eyes are just...

[ELIZA]
Helpless...

[ANGELICA]
And I realize

[ANGELICA AND COMPANY]
Three fundamental truths at the exact same time...

[HAMILTON]
Where are you taking me?

[ANGELICA]
I'm about to change your life

[HAMILTON]
Then by all means, lead the way

[COMPANY (EXCEPT ANGELICA)]
Number one!

[ANGELICA]
I'm a girl in a world in which
My only job is to marry rich
My father has no sons so I'm the one
Who has to social climb for one
So I'm the oldest and the wittiest and the gossip in
New York City is insidious
Alexander is penniless
Ha! That doesn't mean I want him any less

[ELIZA]
Elizabeth Schuyler. It's a pleasure to meet you

[HAMILTON]
Schuyler?

[ANGELICA]
My sister

[COMPANY]
Number two!

[ANGELICA]
He's after me cuz I'm a Schuyler sister
That elevates his status, I'd
Have to be naïve to set that aside
Maybe that is why I introduce him to Eliza
Now that's his bride
Nice going, Angelica, he was right
You will never be satisfied

[ELIZA]
Thank you for all your service

[HAMILTON]
If it takes fighting a war for us to meet, it will have been worth it

[ANGELICA]
I'll leave you to it

[COMPANY]
Number three!

[ANGELICA]
I know my sister like I know my own mind
You will never find anyone as trusting or as kind
If I tell her that I love him she'd be silently resigned
He'd be mine
She would say, "I'm fine"

[ANGELICA AND COMPANY]
She'd be lying

[ANGELICA]
But when I fantasize at night
It's Alexander's eyes
As I romanticize what might
Have been if I hadn't sized him
Up so quickly
At least my dear Eliza's his wife;
At least I keep his eyes in my life...
[ANGELICA]
To the groom!

To the bride!

From your sister

Who is always by your side

To your union

And the hope that you provide

May you always

Be satisfied

And I know

She'll be happy as

His bride
And I know [ALL MEN (EXCEPT HAMILTON)]
To the groom!
To the groom!
To the groom!

To the bride!
To the bride!

Angelica!
Angelica!

By your side

To the union!
To the revolution!

You provide!
You provide!

[HAMILTON AND MEN]
Always-

Be satisfied

Be satisfied

[MEN]
Be satisfied
Be satisfied
Be satisfied
Be satisfied

Be satisfied
Be satisfied

Be satisfied
Be satisfied
Be satisfied
Be satisfied.

[ALL WOMEN (EXCEPT ELIZA)]

The Story of Tonight (Reprise)

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[LAURE]

I may not live to see our glory!

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE]
I may not live to see our glory!

[LAURE]

But I've seen wonders great and small

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE]
I've seen wonders great and small

[LAURE]

‘Cause if the tomcat can get married

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE]
If Alexander can get married-

[LAURE]

There's hope for our ass, after all!

[LAFAYETTE]
Raise a glass to freedom

[LAURENS/MULLIGAN]
Hey!
Something you will never see again!

[MULLIGAN]
No matter what she tells you

[LAFAYETTE]
Let's have another round tonight!

[LAURE]

Raise a glass to the four of us!

[LAFAYETTE/HAMILTON]
Ho!

[MULLIGAN]
To the newly not poor of us!

[LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/HAMILTON]
Woo!

[LAFAYETTE]
We'll tell the story of tonight

[LAURE]

Let's have another round-

[HAMILTON]
Well, if it isn't Aaron Burr

[BURR]
Sir!

[HAMILTON]
I didn't think that you would make it

[BURR]
To be sure

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE]
Burr!

[BURR]
I came to say congratulations

[MULLIGAN]
Spit a verse, Burr!

[BURR]
I see the whole gang is here

[LAFAYETTE]
You are the worst, Burr!

[HAMILTON]
Ignore them. Congrats to you, Lieutenant Colonel
I wish I had your command instead of manning George's journal

[BURR]
No, you don't

[HAMILTON]
Yes, I do

[BURR]
Now, be sensible
From what I hear, you've made yourself indispensable

[LAURE]

Well, well, I heard
You've got a special someone on the side, Burr

[HAMILTON]
Is that so?

[LAURE]

What are you tryin' to hide, Burr?

[BURR]
I should go

[HAMILTON]
No, these guys should go

[LAFAYETTE]
What?

[LAURE]

No!

[HAMILTON]
Leave us alone

[MULLIGAN]
Man...

[HAMILTON]
It's alright, Burr. I wish you'd brought this girl with you tonight, Burr

[BURR]
You're very kind, but I'm afraid it's unlawful, sir

[HAMILTON]
What do you mean?

[BURR]
She's married

[HAMILTON]
I see

[BURR]
She's married to a British officer

[HAMILTON]
Oh shit...

[BURR]
Congrats again, Alexander. Smile more
I'll see you on the other side of the war

[HAMILTON]
I will never understand you
If you love this woman, go get her! What are you waiting for?

[BURR]
I'll see you on the other side of the war

[HAMILTON]
I'll see you on the other side of the war

Wait For It

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[BURR]
Theodosia writes me a letter everyday
I'm keeping the bed warm while her husband is away
He's on the British side in Georgia
He's trying to keep the colonies in line
But he can keep all of Georgia
Theodosia, she's mine

Love doesn't discriminate
Between the sinners
And the saints
It takes and it takes and it takes
And we keep loving anyway
We laugh and we cry
And we break
And we make our mistakes
And if there's a reason I'm by her side
When so many have tried
Then I'm willing to wait for it
I'm willing to wait for it
[BURR]
My grandfather was a fire and brimstone preacher

But there are things that the
Homilies and hymns won't teach ya

My mother was a genius

My father commanded respect

When they died they left no instructions
Just a legacy to protect

[MEN]
Preacher, preacher
Preacher

Teach ya, teach ya, teach ya

Respect, respect

[WOMEN]
Genius


[LAURE]

GOOD NEWS, SHE'S DEAD!
THE WITCH OF THE WEST IS DEAD!
THE WICKEDEST WITCH THERE EVER WAS,
THE ENEMY OF ALL OF US HERE IN [,
IS DEAD! GOOD NEWS! GOOD NEWS!

[LAURE]

Look, it's Glinda!


[LAURE]

floats in on a giant bubble

[LAURE]

 It's good to see me, isn't it? ([Ozians Agree) No need to respond that was rhetorical. Fellow [Ozia]


[BURR]
LET US BE GLAD,
LET US BE GRATEFUL,
LET US REJOICIFY THAT GOODNESS COULD SUBDUE
THE WICKED WORKINGS OF YOU KNOW WHO!
ISN'T IT NICE TO KNOW
THAT GOOD WILL CONQUER EVIL?
THE TRUTH WE ALL BELIEVE'LL BY AND BY
OUTLIVE A LIE
FOR YOU AND...

[BURR]
Glinda! Exactly how dead is she?

[[Burr] Well, there has been much rumor and speculation... innuendo, outuendo...
but let me set the record straight. According to the Time Dragon Clock, the melting occurred at the 13th hour;
a direct result of a bucket of water thrown by a female child. Yes, the Wicked Witch of the West is dead!

[Ozian]
NO ONE MOURNS THE WICKED!

[Ozian]
NO ONE CRIES THEY WON'T RETURN!

[Ozia]

NO ONE LAYS A LILY ON THEIR GRAVE!
[Ozian Man]
THE GOOD MAN SCORNS THE WICKED!
Women]
THROUGH THEIR LIVES OUR CHILDREN LEARN!

[Ozia]

WHAT WE MISS WHEN WE MISBEHAVE!
[Burr]
AND GOODNESS KNOWS
THE WICKEDS' LIVES ARE LONELY
GOODNESS KNOWS
THE WICKED DIE ALONE
IT JUST SHOWS WHEN YOU'RE WICKED
YOU'RE LEFT ONLY
ON YOUR OWN
[Ozia]

YES, GOODNESS KNOWS
THE WICKEDS' LIVES ARE LONELY
GOODNESS KNOWS
THE WICKED CRY ALONE
NOTHING GROWS FOR THE WICKED
THEY REAP ONLY
WHAT THEY'VE SEWN
[Ozian] Glinda, why does wickedness happen?
[Burr] That's a good question; one that many people find confusifying. Are people born wicked,
or do they have wickedness thrust upon them? After all, she had a childhood,;
She had a father, who just happed to be the governor of munchlinkland Witch's Parents Enter.

[Frex]
 I'm off to the assembly, dear.
[Burr] She had a mother, as so many do...
[Frex]

HOW I HATE TO GO AND LEAVE YOU LONELY
Melena]
THAT'S ALRIGH IT'S ONLY JUST ONE NIGHT
[Frex]

BUT KNOW THAT YOU'RE HERE, IN MY HEART
WHILE I'M OUT OF YOUR SIGHT!
Frex Exits. A Lover Runs Into The Room.
[Burr] And like all families, they had their secrets.
Lover]
HAVE ANOTHER DRINK, MY DARK EYED BEAUTY,
I'VE GOT ONE MORE NIGHT LEFT HERE IN TOWN,
SO HAVE ANOTHER DRINK OF GREEN ELIXER
AND WE'LL HAVE OURSELVES A LITTLE MIXER
HAVE ANOTHER LITTLE SWALLOW LITTLE LADY,
AND FOLLOW ME DOWN
[Burr] And of course, from the moment she was born she was... well... different!
Midwife] AHHH!! It's coming!
[Frex]
 Now?
Midwife] The baby's coming!
[Frex]
 And how!

Midwife]
I SEE A NOSE!
[Frex]

I SEE A CURL!
Both]
IT'S A HEALTHY, PERFECT, LOVELY LITTLE...
(They Scream)
Melena] What is it? What's wrong?
Midwife]
HOW CAN IT BE?
[Frex]

WHAT DOES IT MEAN?
Midwife]
IT'S ATTROCIOUS!
[Frex]

IT'S OBSCENE!
Both]
LIKE A FROGGY, FERNY CABBAGE,
THE BABY IS UNATURALLY
GREEN!!!
[Frex]
 Take it away... Take it away!!!!
[Burr] So you see, it couldn't have been easy!

Munchki]

NO ONE MOURNS THE WICKED!
NOW AT LAST, SHE'S DEAD AND GONE!
NOW AT LAST THERE'S JOY THROUGHOUT THE LAND!
AND GOODNESS KNOWS (GOODNESS KNOWS)
WE KNOW WHAT GOODNESS IS (OOOOHHHH)
GOODNESS KNOWS, THE WICKED DIE ALONE (SHE DIED ALONE)
WOE TO THOSE (WOE TO THOSE)
WHO SPURN WHAT GOODNESSES THEY ARE SHOWN!
NO ONE MOURNS THE WICKED (GOOD NEWS)
NO ONE MOURNS THE WICKED (GOOD NEWS)
NO ONE MOURNS... THE WICKED...
WICKED...
WICKED!!!!!
[Burr] Well, this has been fun! But as you can imagine I have much to attend to,
what with the Wizard's unexpected departure. So, if there are no further questions...
[Ozian] Glinda, is it true you were her friend?
[Ozians Gasp
[Burr] Well, I... you see... um... yes.
Louder Gasps
[Burr] Well, it depends on what you mean by "friend". She Motions Her Bubble Downward.
I did know her. That is, our paths did cross... at school. But you must understand, it was a long time ago and we were both very young.

[Students]

O, HALLOWED HALLS AND VINE DRAPED WALLS
THE PROUDLIEST SITE THERE IS.
WHEN GREY AND SEER OUR HAIR HATH TURNED,
WE SHALL STILL REVERE THE LESSONS LEARNED
IN OUR DAYS AT DEAR OLD SHIZ (DEAR OLD SHIZ)
OUR DAYS AT DEAR OLD...

SHIZZZZZZZZZZZ (DEAR OLD SHIZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ)
Frex Wheels Nessarose On Stage.
[HAMILTON]
 What?! What are you looking at? Oh, do I have something in my teeth?
Okay, let's get this over with. No, I'm not seasick, yes, I've always been green, no, I didn't chew grass as a child.
[Frex]
 Elphaba!
[HAMILTON] Oh, this is my younger sister, Nessarose. As you can see, she is a perfectly normal color.
[Frex]
 Elphaba, stop making a spectacle of yourself! I'm only sending you here for one reason...
[HAMILTON] Yes, I know, to look after Nessarose.
Frex Holds Out A Box.
[Frex]
 My precious little girl] a parting gift.
[Angelica]
 Now, father... He Pulls Silver Shoes From The Box. Jeweled shoes!
[Frex]
 As befits the future governor of Munchkinland. Elphaba, take care of your sister.
And try not to talk so much! He Kisses Nessarose And Exits.
[Angelica]
 Elphaba...
[HAMILTON] Well what could he have gotten me? I clash with everything!
Mme. Morrible Enters
[Morrible]
 Welcome, new students! I am Madame Morrible, headmistress here, at Shiz University.
And whether you're here to study logic, literature, or linguification,
I know I speak for my fellow faculty members when I say we have nothing but the highest hopes for some of you.
Now, regarding room assignments... Elphaba & Galinda Raise Their Hands.
She Notices Galinda First. Yes, is this regarding room assignments?
[linda]

 Oh, Madame, thank you for asking, but I've already been assigned a private suite...
Noticing Her Followers' Disappointment. But you can all come visit me whenever you want!
Shen Shen] How good of you!
Pfanee] You are so good!
[linda]

 No I'm not!
Both] Yes you are!
[linda]

 Now stop! Swishes Her Hair.
[Morrible]
 Do you have a question?

[linda]

 Yes, you see, I am Galinda Upland of the Upperuplands... I've applied to your sorcery seminar,
and indeed that is my sole purpose of attending Shiz; to study sorcery with you.
Perhaps you recall my essay, "Magic Wands, Need They Have A Point".
[Morrible]
 Yes... However, I do not teach my seminar every semester, unless, of course, somebody special were to come along.
[linda]

 Well, exactly!
[HAMILTON] We have not yet received our room assignments.
[Morrible]
 Yes, yes, of course! Oh, You must be Miss Nessarose, the governor's daughter.
What a tragically beautiful face you have! Sees Elphaba, snorts...And you must be.
[HAMILTON] I'm the other daughter. Elphaba. I'm beautifully tragic.
[Morrible]
 Yes, yes, I'm sure you're very bright.
[linda]

 Bright? She's phosphorescent.
[Morrible]
 I don't seem to have you on my list. Oh, well a slight gulch, but not to fret! We'll find someplace to put you.
[linda]

 Y'know, I don't even think she read my essay.
Shen Shen] That's so unfair!
[Angelica]
 You should say something!
[linda]

 Should I?
Pfanee] Do it!
[Morrible]
 Now, which one of you young ladies would like to volunteer to share with Miss Elphaba?
[linda]

 Madame Morrible...
[Morrible]
 Thank you dear. Oh, how very good of you!
[linda]

 What?
[Morrible]
 Miss Elphaba, you may share with Miss Galinda.
[linda]

 Huh?
[Morrible]
 The governor made his concern for your sister's well being quite clear.
So, I thought it would be best if she share my private compartment where I can assist her as needed...
[HAMILTON] But Madame, I've always looked after my sister.
[Morrible]
 Everyone, to your dormitories.
[HAMILTON] But Madame...
[HAMILTON] Let her go!!!
Nessarose's Wheelchair Is Torn From Morrible's Hands And Begins To Wheel Itself Back To Elphaba.
[Morrible]
 How did you do that?
[linda]

 How did she do that?
[Angelica]
 Elphaba!
[Morrible]
 You mean this has happened before?
[HAMILTON] Uh... Something just comes over me sometimes... I'm sorry, Madame.
[Morrible]
 What? Never apologize for talent! Talent is a gift! Have you ever considered a career in sorcery?
[HAMILTON] Sorcery?
[Morrible]
 I shall tutor you myself, and take no other students.
[linda]

 What?
All Students But Galinda Exit.
[Morrible]
 Oh, Miss Elphaba...
MANY YEARS I HAVE WAITED
FOR A GIFT LIKE YOURS TO APPEAR
WHY I PREDICT THE WIZARD COULD MAKE YOU HIS
MAGIC, GRAND VIZIER!
MY DEAR, MY DEAR,
I'LL WRITE AT ONCE TO THE WIZARD
TELL HIM OF YOU IN ADVANCE
WITH A TALENT LIKE YOURS, DEAR, THERE IS
A DEFIN-ISH CHANCE
IF YOU WORK AS YOU SHOULD
YOU'LL BE MAKING GOOD
[linda]

 Madame Morrible...
[Morrible]
 No, not now dearest. She Exits.
[Burr] This will just make me a better person. She simles.
She Runs Off.

[HAMILTON]
DID THAT REALLY JUST HAPPEN?
HAVE I ACTUALLY UNDERSTOOD?
THIS WEIRD QUIRK I'VE TRIED TO SURPRESS OR HIDE
IS A TALENT THAT COULD HELP ME MEET THE WIZARD
IF I MAKE GOOD
SO I'LL MAKE GOOD.
WHEN I MEET THE WIZARD,
ONCE I PROVE MY WORTH,
AND THEN I MEET THE WIZARD,
WHAT I'VE WAITED FOR SINCE
SINCE BIRTH!
AND WITH ALL HIS WIZARD WISDOM
BY MY LOOKS HE WON'T BE BLINDED
DO YOU THINK THE WIZARD IS DUMB?
OR LIKE MUNCHKINS SO SMALL-MINDED? NO!
HE'LL SAY TO ME "I SEE WHO YOU TRULY ARE,
A GIRL ON WHOM I CAN RELY"
AND THAT'S HOW WE'LL BEGIN,
THE WIZARD AND I
ONCE I'M WITH THE WIZARD,
MY WHOLE LIFE WILL CHANGE,
'CUZ ONCE YOU'RE WITH THE WIZARD
NO ONE THINKS YOU'RE STRANGE
NO FATHER IS NOT PROUD OF YOU,
NO SISTER ACTS ASHAMED,
AND ALL OF OzHAS TO LOVE YOU
WHEN BY THE WIZARD YOU'RE ACLAIMED
AND THIS GIFT OR THIS CURSE
THAT I HAVE INSIDE
MAYBE AT LAST I'LL KNOW WHY
WHEN WE ARE HAND IN HAND,
THE WIZARD AND I
AND ONE DAY HE'LL SAY TO ME, "ELPHABA,
A GIRL WHO IS SO SUPERIOR,
SHOULDN'T A GIRL WHO'S SO GOOD INSIDE
HAVE A MATCHING EXTERIOR?
AND SINCE FOLKS HERE TO AN OBSURED DEGREE
SEEM FIXATED ON YOUR VERDEGRIS
WOULD IT BE ALRIGHT BY YOU
IF I DEGREENIFY YOU?"
AND OF COURSE THAT'S NOT IMPORTANT TO ME
"ALRIGHT! WHY NOT?" I'LL REPLY
OH, WHAT A PAIR WE'LL BE
THE WIZARD AND I
YES, WHAT A PAIR WE'LL BE
THE WIZARD AND...
UNLIMITED, MY FUTURE IS UNLIMITED
AND I'VE JUST HAD A VISION ALMOST LIKE A PROPHECY
I KNOW
IT SOUNDS TRULY CRAZY
AND TRUE, THE VISION'S HAZY
BUT I SWEAR SOME DAY THERE'LL BE
A CELEBRATION THROUGHOUT [Oz
THAT'S ALL TO DO
WITH ME!
AND I'LL STAND THERE WITH THE WIZARD
FEELING THINGS I'VE NEVER FELT
AND THOUGH I'D NEVER SHOW IT
I'D BE SO HAPPY I COULD MELT!
AND SO IT WILL BE FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE
AND I'LL WANT NOTHING ELSE 'TILL I DIE
HELD IN SUCH HIGH ESTEEM!
WHEN PEOPLE SEE ME THEY WILL SCREAM
FOR HALF OF [Oz'S FAVORITE TEAM]
THE WIZARD...
AND I!!!!

[linda]

 Dearest, Darlingest Momsy and Popsicle...
[HAMILTON] My dear father...
Both]

BUT, OF COURSE, I'LL RISE ABOVE IT...
Both]
FOR I KNOW THAT'S HOW YOU'D WANT ME TO RESPOND
Yes...
THERE'S BEEN SOME CONFUSION FOR YOU SEE MY ROOMATE IS...
[linda]


UNUSUALLY, AND EXCEEDLINGLY PECULIAR AND ALTOGETHER QUITE IMPOSSIBLE TO DESCRIBE...
[HAMILTON] Blonde.
[linda]

I FELT THE MOMENT I LAID EYES ON YOU!
[linda]


MY PULSE IS RUSHING...
[HAMILTON]
MY HEAD IS REELING...

WITH SIMPLE, UTTER LOATHING
THERE'S A STRANGE EXHILARTION

IT'S SO PURE, SO STRONG!
THOUGH, I DO ADMIT IT CAME ON FAST,
STILL I DO BELIEVE THAT IT CAN LAST!
AND I WILL BE LOATHING, LOATHING YOU
MY WHOLE LIFE LONG!
[Students]

DEAR GALINDA, YOU ARE JUST TOO GOOD!
HOW DO YOU STAND IT, I DON'T THINK I COULD!
SHE'S A TERROR! SHE'S A TARTAR!
WE DON'T MEAN TO SHOW A BIAS,
BUT GALINDA, YOU'RE A MARTAR!
[linda]

 Well...

[Students]

[HAMILTON] Boo!
[linda]

 Ahh!
[HAMILTON] Hahahaha!

[Hamilton]
 Settle down, now! I have read your most recent essays. And I am amazed to report the progress!
Although, some of us still tend to favor form over content... Ms. Glinda.
[linda]

 It's GAlinda.
[Hamilton]
 Excuse me... Glinda.
[linda]

 I really don't see what the problem is. Every other professor seems to be able to pronounce my name.
[HAMILTON] Maybe pronouncing your precious name isn't the sole purpose of Doctor Dillamond's life. Maybe he's not like every other professor. Maybe some of us are different.
[linda]

 Oh! It seems the artichoke is steamed.
[Hamilton]
 Class, class! Miss Elphaba has a point! As you know, I am the sole Animal on the faculty. The token Goat, as it were. But it wasn't always this way. Oh, dear students, how I wish you could have seen it as it once was. Where you could walk down the halls and see an antelope explicating a sonnet, a snow leopard solving an equation, a wildebeast waxing philosophic. Don't you see, dear students, how our dear Ozis becoming less and less...looks at Elphaba... colorful. Now, who can tell me what sent these events into motion?
[HAMILTON] Raises hand From what I've heard, it all started with the great drought.
[Hamilton]
 Exactly. Food grew scarce, people grew hungrier and angrier. And the question became "Whom can we blame?" Can anyone tell me what is meant by the term "Scapegoat"? Elphaba Raises Hand. Someone besides Miss Elphaba? Ah yes, Miss Glinda...
[linda]

 It's GAlinda... with a GA. I don't see why you can't just teach us history instead of always harping on the past.
[Hamilton]
 Well, perhaps these questions will enlighten you... Walks Over To The Chalk Board And Turns It Over. On it is written] ANIMALS SHOULD BE SEEN AND NOT HEARD. Who is responsible for this? I'm waiting for answer... Very well, that will be all for today... You heard me, class dismissed!!!
All Students Exit Except Elphaba & Nessarose. Dillamond Has His Back Turned To Her.
[HAMILTON] You go on ahead, Nessa.
Nessarose Exits.
[HAMILTON] Reading The Board Aloud. "Animals should be seen and not heard..."
[Hamilton]
 Oh, Miss Elphaba, don't worry about me, go along and enjoy your friends.
[HAMILTON] Oh that's alright, I have no friends. Would you like to share my lunch?
[Hamilton]
 Oh, thank you! How kind.
She Pulls Out A Candy Bar And Unwraps It. He Takes The Paper and Begins To Eat It. He Sees The Board.
[Hamilton]
 I seem to have lost my appetite.
[HAMILTON] You shouldn't let statements like that bother you. I mean, I always do, but you shouldn't.
[Hamilton]
if it were only a matter of words on a chalkboard. But the things one hears these days... dreadful things! Miss Elphaba...

I'VE HEARD OF AN OX, A PROFESSOR FROM QUOX
NO LONG PERMITTED TO TEACH,
WHO HAS LOST ALL POWERS OF SPEECH.
AND AN OWL IN MUNCHKIN ROCK
A VICAR WITH A THRIVING FLOCK
FORBIDDEN TO PREACH
NOW HE ONLY CAN SCREECH!
ONLY RUMORS, BUT STILL, ENOUGH TO GIVE PAUSE
TO ANYONE WITH PAWS
SOMETHING BAD IS HAPPENING IN [Oz
[HAMILTON]
SOMETHING BAD?
HAPPENING IN [Oz?
[Hamilton]

UNDER THE SURFACE
BEHIND THE SCENES
SOMETHING BAAAAAH...
Sorry, bad...
[HAMILTON] Dr. Dillamond, are you alright? Shall I fetch you a glass of water?
[Hamilton]
 No, I don't know what came over me.
[HAMILTON] So, you're saying that there are animals that have, somehow, forgotten how to speak? But, how is that possible?
[Hamilton]
 Well, with so much pressure not to...
Morrible Enters.
[Morrible]
 I heard there was some sort of disturburance in class. Are you alright, Doctor? Oh, Miss Elphaba, you're still here! I thought you would have been on your way to my seminar by now.
[HAMILTON] Yes Madame, ordinarily I would be but...
[Morrible]
 But what? I do hope I have not misplaced my trust in you. Magic is a very demanderating mistress, and if one has ambitions of meeting the Wizard. I'm sure Doctor Dillamond sees my point.
Morrible Exits.
[HAMILTON] I'd better go. Doctor Dillamond, if something bad is happening to the Animals then someone has to tell the Wizard. That's why we have a Wizard!
SO NOTHING BAD
Both]
NOTHNG ALL THAT BAD
[Hamilton]

NOTHING TRULY BAAAAHHH...
Sorry... Bad.
[HAMILTON]
IT COULDN'T HAPPEN HERE,
IN [Oz...


[BURR]
 Here we are, sir! Shiz University!
[BURR]
 What? Already?
[BURR]
 Yes, sir.
[BURR]
 What a shame. Well, we'll see you soon, Avaric. Don't worry, I won't last longer at this school than I did at any of the others.
Avaric Exits.
[Angelica]
 Uh, miss Galinda, I know I'm just a munchkin, but munchkins have feelings too, and I've been trying to tell you mine, for you. But sometimes it seems like you don't even know I'm there.
[linda]

 That's not true, Biq.
[Angelica]
 It's LAFAYETE.
[linda]

 Biq, do you know who that is? That's Fiyero Tiggular, tha Winkie Prince whose reputation is so scandalacious!
LAFAYETE Looks Disgusted. Fiyero Walks Toward Them. Galinda Swishes Her Hair. Fiyero, Noticing Her Strange Behavior, Does The Same.
[linda]

 To Fiyero. Were you looking for something or someone?
[BURR]
 Uhhh yea... history... class? I don't know... somewhere?
[Angelica]
 History building is way over there my friend...
[linda]

 That class just ended!
[BURR]
 Oh! Perfect timing! So, uh, what does one do for fun around here?
[linda]

 Nothing really... until now...
[Angelica]
 We've been studying!
[BURR]
 Well, I see that once again the responsibility to corrupt my fellow students falls to me. Fortunately, I'm up for the task.


[BURR]

THE TROUBLE WITH SCHOOLS IS
THEY ALWAYS TRY TO TEACH THE WRONG LESSON
BELIEVE ME, I'VE BEEN KICKED OUT OF ENOUGH OF THEM TO KNOW!
THEY WANT YOU TO BECOME LESS CALLOW, LESS SHALLOW,
BUT I SAY WHY INVITE STRESS IN?
STOP STUDYING STRIFE
AND LEARN TO LIVE
THE UNEXAMINED LIFE...
DANCIN' THROUGH LIFE
SKIMMING THE SURFACE
GLIDING WHERE TURF IS SMOOTH
LIFE IS PAINLESS FOR THE BRAINLESS
THOSE WHO DON'T TRY, NEVER LOOK FOOLISH
DANCING THROUGH LIFE
NO NEED TO TOUGH IT
WHEN YOU CAN SLUFF IT OFF AS I DO
NOTHING MATTERS, BUT KNOWING NOTHING MATTERS
IT'S JUST LIFE, SO KEEP DANCING THROUGH
DANCING THROUGH LIFE
SWAYING AND SWEEPING
AND ALWAYS KEEPING COOL
LIFE IS FRAUGHTLESS
WHEN YOU'RE THOUGHTLESS
THOSE WHO DON'T TRY
NEVER LOOK FOOLISH
DANCING THROUGH LIFE
MINDLESS AND CARELESS
MAKE SURE YOU'RE WHERE LESS TROUBLE IS RIFE
WHOES ARE FLEETING
BLOWS ARE GLANCING
WHEN YOU'RE DANCING
THROUGH LIFE!
So! What's the most swankified place in town?
[linda]

 That would be the

Sounds perfect!
LET'S GO DOWN TO THE [OzDUST BALLROOM
WE'LL MEET THERE LATER TONIGHT
WE CAN DANCE 'TIL IT'S LIGHT
FIND THE PRETTIEST GIRL
GIVE HER A WHIRL!
RIGHT ON DOWN TO THE [OzDUST BALLROOM
COME ON FOLLOW ME!
YOU'LL BE HAPPY TO BE THERE
[Students]

DANCIN' THROUGH LIFE, DOWN AT THE [OzDUST (LIFE!)
[BURR]

IF ONLY BECAUSE DUST IS WHAT WE COME TO!
[Students]

NOTHIN' MATTERS, BUT KNOWING NOTHING MATTERS
IT'S JUST LIFE!!!
[BURR]

SO KEEP DANCING THROUGH...
[Angelica]
 Miss Galinda? I hope you'll save at least one dance for me. I'll be waiting right there, right by your side, waiting, all night.
[linda]

 Oh, how very kind, Biq.
[Angelica]
 ... LAFAYETE...
[linda]

 But, do you know what would be even kinder?
SEE THAT TRAGICALLY BEAUTIFUL GIRL?
THE ONE IN THE CHAIR?
IT SEEMS SO UNFAIR
WE SHOULD GO ON A SPREE
AND NOT SHE, GEE
I KNOW SOMEONE WOULD BE MY HERO
IF THAT SOMEONE WERE
TO GO INVITE HER!
[Angelica]
 Well, maybe I could invite her!
[linda]


OH, BIQ, REALLY?
YOU WOULD DO THAT FOR ME?
[Angelica]
 I would do anything for you, Miss Galinda. Walks Over To Nessarose.
Excuse me, Miss Nessarose? There's something I'd like to ask you...
[BURR]
 To Galinda. You're good.
[linda]

 I don't know what you mean. But I do happen to be free tonight, so...
[BURR]
 So, I'll be picking you up around eight?
[linda]

 After all...
NOW THAT WE'VE MET ONE ANOTHER,
Both]
IT'S CLEAR WE DESERVE EACHOTHER!
[linda]

 You're perfect!
[BURR]
 You're perfect!
[CAST]
SO WE'RE PERFECT TOGETHER
BORN TO BE FOREVER
DANCING THROUGH LIFE!!!
[HAMILTON] It's absurd! This silly, rich boy appears and everyone's off to worship him and some cultish social gathering!
[Angelica]
 Even me! I'm going! Isn't it wonderful? LAFAYETE was too shy to ask me at first, but once Galinda encouraged him...
[HAMILTON] Galinda?!
[Angelica]
 Don't you dare say another word against her! I'm about to have the first happy night of my life all thanks to Galinda!
FINALLY FOR THIS ONE NIGHT,
I'M ABOUT TO HAVE A FUN NIGHT
WITH THIS MUNCHKIN BOY GALINDA FOUND FOR ME
AND I ONLY WISH THERE WERE
SOMETHING I COULD DO FOR HER TO REPAY HER
ELPHABA SEE...
WE DESERVE EACHOTHER AND GALINDA HELPED IT COME TRUE
WE DESERVE EACHOTHER, ME AND LAFAYETE
Please, Elphaba, try to understand.
[HAMILTON] I do...
[linda]

 Now I must accessorize myself for Fiyero.
Shen Shen Pulls The Witch's Hat Out Of One Of Galinda's Hat Boxes.
Pfanee] Galinda, what in [Oz's name!?
[linda]

 Now, just pretend you didn't see that. My granny is always giving me the most hideodeous hats.
I'd give it away, but I don't hate anyone that much.
Shen Shen] Yes you do!
Pfanee] Give it to her! Just do it!
They All Stare At Elphaba. Galinda Walks Forward, Meeting Elphaba Half Way.
[HAMILTON] Galinda, listen, Nessa and I were talking about you just now...
[linda]

 And I was just talking about you! I thought you might want to wear this hat to the party tonight! Gives Her The Hat.
IT'S REALLY... UH... SHARP!
DON'T YOU THINK?
Y'KNOW BLACK, IS THIS YEAR'S PINK!
YOU DESERVE EACHOTHER,
THIS HAT AND YOU,
YOU'RE BOTH SO... SMART!
YOU DESERVE EACHOTHER, SO HERE!
OUT OF THE GOODNESS OF MY HEART!
Galinda Runs Off. Elphaba Laughs At The Sight Of The Hat. She Exits.. The Students Enter And Dance.
When This Is Done, LAFAYETE And Nessarose Appear, Awkwardly Holding Hands.
[Angelica]
 What's in the punch?
[Angelica]
 Lemons, and melons, and pears!
[Angelica]
 Oh my!
[Angelica]

LISTEN NESSA...
[Angelica]
 Yes?
[Angelica]

UH, NESSA...
I'VE GOT SOMETHING TO CONFESS A
REASON WHY, WELL, WHY I ASKED YOU HERE TONIGHT...
NOW, I KNOW IT ISN'T FAIR.
[Angelica]
 Oh, LAFAYETE, I know why.
[Angelica]
 You do?
[Angelica]

IT'S BECAUSE I'M IN THIS CHAIR, AND YOU FELT SORRY FOR ME...
WELL, ISN'T THAT RIGHT?
[Angelica]
 No... it's because... uh... because...
BECAUSE YOU ARE SO BEAUTIFUL!
[Angelica]
 Oh, LAFAYETE!
I THINK YOU'RE WONDERFUL!
AND WE DESERVE EACH OTHER, DON'T YOU SEE THIS IS OUR CHANCE?
WE DESERVE EACH OTHER, DON'T WE LAFAYETE?
[Angelica]
 You know what? Let's dance!
[Angelica]
 What?
[Angelica]

LET'S DANCE!
They Dance, As Well As The Others Around Them. Finally, Mme. Morrible Runs Up To Galinda.
[Morrible]
 Oh, Miss Upland?
[linda]

 Madame Morrible... What are you doing here?
[Morrible]
 I have something for you. She Hands Her A Small Wand.
[linda]

 Gasps. Madame... a training wand... How can I ever express my graditution?
[Morrible]
 Oh, don't thank me! This was your roommate's idea, not mine.
[linda]

 What? Elphaba?
[Morrible]
 Miss Elphaba requested that I include you in sorcery class. She insisted I tell you this very night or she would quit the seminar.
[linda]

 But... why?
[Morrible]
 I have no idea. My personal opinion is you do not have what it takes. I hope you'll prove me wrong... I doubt you will.
She Leaves. Fiyero Comes Up To Galinda.
[BURR]
 What is it?
[linda]

 I got what I wanted...
[BURR]
 Then what's the matter?
[linda]

 Nothing...
[BURR]
 Good. Let's dance...
They Begin To Dance As Elphaba Walks In. They Stop As All The Students Gasp And Make Comments About The Way She Is Dressed. People Then Start Laughing.
[BURR]
 Who in Ozis this?
[linda]

 My roommate... please, don't ... stare!
[BURR]
 How can you help it?
Elphaba Takes Off The Hat, Noticing The Comments. She Waits, Then Puts It Back On And Begins To Dance. She Is Alone. There Is No Music.
[BURR]
 Well I'll say this, she doesn't give a twig about what anyone else thinks.
[linda]

 Of course does, she just pretends not to... I feel awful...
[BURR]
 Why? It's not like it's your fault.
[linda]

 Excuse me... She Walks Over To Elphaba and Clears Her Throat. May I cut in?
Galinda Begins Dancing Just As Horribly. The Students Now Accept It, And Begin To Dance Again As The Music Starts.
All]
DANCING THROUGH LIFE, DOWN AT THE [OzDUST
IF ONLY BECAUSE DUST IS WHAT WE COME TO
AND THE STRANGE THING, YOUR LIFE COULD END UP CHANGING
WHILE YOU'RE DANCING THROUGH

[Scene 9 - Sharing Secrets]
Elphaba & Galinda Barge Into Their Suite... Galinda Is In Hysterics.
[linda]

 Your very first party ever?! Your very first party! Oh I know! Let's tell each other something we've never told anyone... I'll go first] Fiyero and I are going to be married (squeals).
[HAMILTON] Really? He's asked you already?
[linda]

 No, he doesn't know yet... Now, you tell me a secret.
[HAMILTON] Like what?
[linda]

 Like... Why do you always sleep with this funny, little, green bottle under your pillow? Grabs The Bottle.
[HAMILTON] Give that back.
[linda]

 C'mon, tell me. Tell me tell me!
[HAMILTON] It was my mother's! That's all...
Silence.
[linda]

 Hands Her The Bottle. It's not fair. I told you a really good one.
[HAMILTON] My father hates me.
[linda]

 Gasps.
[HAMILTON] No, that's not the secret. It's my fault...
[linda]

 What is?
[HAMILTON] ... that my sister is the way she is. . Pause. You see, when my mother was carrying Nessa, my father was worried that the new baby might come out...
Both] Green.
[HAMILTON] So he made my mother chew milk flowers, day and night. But that made Nessa come too soon, with her little legs all tangled. And my mother never woke up. None of which ever would have happened if not for me.
[linda]

 But that was the milkflowers fault, not yours. That may be your secret, Elphaba, but that doesn't make it true. She Oh look, it's tomorrow! Elphie... do you mind if I call you Elphie?
[HAMILTON] Well, it's a little perky.
[linda]

 And you can call me... Galinda. So... Elphie... now that we're friends, I've decided to make you my new project!
[HAMILTON] You really don't have to do that.
[linda]

 I know, that's what makes me so nice!

[HAMILTON] This is never going to work!
[linda]

 Oh Elphie, you mustn't think that way anymore! Your whole life is going to change... and all because of me. Okay, stand... I will turn your frock into a beautiful ball gown! Stand up... She Picks Up Her Wand And Waves It. Ball gown!!! Nothing Happens, So She Repeats. Ball gown!!! Still Nothing Happens. She Taps Her Wand On The Bed. Is this thing on?
[HAMILTON] Do you want me to try?
[linda]

 No, I've got it! She Throws The Wand Down. Oh, just wear the frock... it's pretty! Now,
I'll show you how to flip your hair] Flip flip. Or you could use your hand. Demonstrates.
Or, you can use your whole body. Falls onto bed. Squeals. Now, for the finishing touch.
Takes flower out of her hair, puts it into Elphaba's. Why, Miss Elphaba, look at you, you're beautiful. Hands her the mirror.
[HAMILTON] After Looking In The Mirror. I... I have to go.
She Runs Off.
[linda]

 You're Welcome! She Admires Herself In The Mirror.
AND THOUGH YOU PROTEST
YOUR DISINTEREST,
I KNOW CLANDESTINELY...
YOU'RE GONNA GRIN AND BEAR IT
YOUR NEW FOUND POPULARITY! (SQUEALS)
LA LA LA LA

AS ME!!!

[HAMILTON] Flips her hair.. Flip Flip! What?
[BURR]
 Nothing, it's just... you've been "Galinda-fied". You don't have to do that , you know?
[Hamilton]
 Alright, take your seats, class! I have something to say, and very little time to say it. This is my last day here at Shiz I am no longer permitted to teach. I want to thank you for your sharing your enthusiasm, your essays, no matter how feebly structured, and even, on occasion, your lunch.
Mme. Morrible Rushes In.
[Morrible]
 Doctor Dillamond! I'm so dreadfully sorry.
[HAMILTON] Madame, we've got to do something.
[Hamilton]
 Miss Elphaba, they can take away my job, but I shall continue speaking out.
Scientist] Come on, goat...
To Men Begin To Carry Him Out Of The Room.
[Hamilton]
 They are not telling you the whole story! Remember that, class! Remember that.
He Is Gone.
[HAMILTON] Doctor Dillamond! After A Pause. Well, are you just going to sit here in silence?
[Morrible]
 Miss Elphaba, there is nothing we can do. Please take your seat.
Professor] Good afternoon, students!
[Morrible]
 Good afternoon.
Professor] Every day, with every tick of the Time Dragon Clock, in every corner of our great [Oz, one hears the silence of progress. For example] this is called a cage!
He Points To A Cage With A Cloth Draped Over It. He Pulls Off The Cloth, Revealing A Lion Cub Inside.
Professor] Now, we will be seeing more and more of them in the near future. This remarkable innovation is actually for the Animal's own good...
[HAMILTON] If this is for his own good, then why is he trembling?
Professor] He's just excited to be here, that's all. Hits the cage. Now, as I was saying, one of the benefits of caging a Lion cub while he's young is that he never, in fact, will learn how to speak.
[HAMILTON] What?
He Motions The Students Forward, Toward The Cage.
Professor] That's right! Come closer!
[HAMILTON] To Fiyero. Can you imagine a world where Animals are kept in cages and they never speak?
Professor] Now, he may seem a bit agitated but that's easily remedied.
[HAMILTON] What should I do?
[BURR]
 I don't know.
[HAMILTON] Well, somebody has to... Do something!!!
Sparks Begin To Fly Everywhere. All Students & The Professor Are Moving Uncontrollably Except Fiyero and Elphaba.
[BURR]
 What's happening?
[HAMILTON] I don't know I got mad...andd
[BURR]
 Alright just don't move! And don't get mad at me... He Grabs The Cage. Well are you coming?
She Runs With Him After He Snatches The Lion Cub.
[HAMILTON] Careful! Don't shake him!
[BURR]
 I'm not!
[HAMILTON] We can't just let him loose anywhere, you know. We have to find someplace safe...
[BURR]
 Don't you think that I realize that? You must think I'm really stupid or something!
[HAMILTON] No, not really stupid.
[BURR]
 Why is it that every time I see you you're causing some sort of commotion?
[HAMILTON] I don't cause commotions, I am one.
[BURR]
 That's for sure.
[HAMILTON] Oh! So you think I should just keep my mouth shut! Is that what you're saying?
[BURR]
 No, I'm...
[HAMILTON] Do you think I want to be this way? Do you think I want to care this much? Don't you know how much easier my life would be if I didn't?
[BURR]
 Do you ever let anyone else talk?
[HAMILTON] Oh, sorry... But can I just say one more thing? You could have just walked away back there.
[BURR]
 So?
[HAMILTON] So, no matter how shallow and self-absorbed you tend to be...
[BURR]
 Excuse me, there's no pretense here. I happen to be genuinely self-absorbed and deeply shallow.
[HAMILTON] No you're not. Or you wouldn't be so unhappy.
[BURR]
 Fine, if you don't want my help...
[HAMILTON] No, I do! Poor little thing, it's heart is trembling... I didn't mean for...
[BURR]
 What did you mean to do? Why was I the only one you didn't do it to?
[HAMILTON] Oh look, you're bleeding... it must have scratched you. Referring To A Cut On His Face.
[BURR]
 Yea... or maybe it scratched me. I better get to safety... I mean the cub... get the cub to safety. He Walks Off.
[HAMILTON] Fiyero...

[[HAMILTON]
Miss Elphaba, there you are!
[HAMILTON] Madame Morrible...
[Morrible]
 Oh Miss Elphaba, I finally heard back from the Wizard!
[HAMILTON] The Wizard?
[Morrible]
 Yes, he wishes to meet you!
[HAMILTON] He asked for me?
[Morrible]
 Yes! I know how devastated you were the other day for our poor Doctor Dillamond, but I can assure you my dear, as one door closes, another one opens. She Hands Her A Green Envelope.
[HAMILTON] Madame, I don't know what to say! How can I ever thank you? She Hugs Her.
[Morrible]
 Oh careful dear, you musn't get wet She Places The Umbrella Back Over Elphaba's Head. Oh, I know! She Waves Her Hands And The Sun Comes Out. Didn't I tell you? Weather is my specialty. [Oz-speed, my dear! Make me proud.
[HAMILTON] I will, I'll try.
Morrible Exits.

[HAMILTON]
AND THERE WE'LL FINALLY BE
THE WIZARD AND I...

Conductor] All aboard!
[linda]

 Remember, eye contact. And don't forget to tell him how wonderful he is, Wizards love that! And be yourself... well... within reason.
LAFAYETE Wheels Nessarose Onstage.
[Angelica]
 Elphaba, I'm so proud of you and I know father would be too. We're all proud, aren't we?
[HAMILTON] You'll be alright, won't you?
[linda]

 She'll be fine! Biq will take care of her, right?
[Angelica]
 ...It's LAFAYETE... I... I can't do this anymore.
He Exits.
[Angelica]
 LAFAYETE...
[linda]

 Nessa, maybe he's just not the right one... for you.
[Angelica]
 No, it's me that's not right. Elphaba, just go, I'll be fine.
She Wheels Herself Offstage.
[HAMILTON] Nessa, wait!
[linda]

 Let her go. She'll have to manage without you. We all will.
[HAMILTON] Please, you'll barely even notice I'm gone. Besides, you have Fiyero. Where is he, anyway? Not that I expected him to say goodbye to me. We barely know each other.
[linda]

 I don't know him either. He's distant, and moodified, and he's been thinking, which really worrries me. I never knew how much he card about that old goat.
Fiyero Enters.
[linda]

 Oh, there he is! Fiyero, over here dearest!
[BURR]
 He Hands Elphaba Flowers. Elphaba, I'm happy for you.
[linda]

 Yes, we are both so happy...
[BURR]
 Uh, listen, I've been thinking...
[HAMILTON] Yes, I've heard.
[BURR]
 About that Lion cub and... everything. I think about that day a lot.
[HAMILTON] Really? So do I.
[linda]

 Me too! Poor Doctor Dillamond. It makes one want to... uh...
take a stand. So I've been thinking of... uh... changing my name.
[BURR]
 Your name?
[linda]

 Well, yes! Since Doctor Dillamond had his own way of pronouncing my name,
in solidarity and to express my outrage, I will henceforward be known no longer as Galinda, but as simply, Glinda.
[BURR]
 Oh well, that's very admirable of you... Glinda. To Elphaba. Elphaba, good luck.
He Runs Off.
[Burr] There, see?
[HAMILTON] Galinda...
[Burr] It's Glinda now. Stupid idea, I don't even know what made me say it.
[HAMILTON] It doesn't matter what your name is, everyone loves you!
[Burr] I don't care! I want him. I don't even think he's perfect anymore and I still want him.
This must be what other people feel like. How do they bear it? They embrace.

[HAMILTON] Come with me.
[Burr] Where?
[HAMILTON] To the Emerald City.
[Burr] Really?
[Ozia]

ONE SHORT DAY, IN THE EMERALD CITY...
[Burr] I've always wanted to see the Emerald City!

[Burr] All the hustle and bustle! It's all so [Ozmopolitan! Elphie... Elphie? C'mon we'll be late for WizOMania.
[HAMILTON] I want to remember this moment, always. Nobody's pointing, nobody's staring, for the first time, I'm somewhere that I belong.
[Burr] You look positively, emerald.

A Large Head Is Rolled Onstage... It Speaks To The Two... Voice Booming
[Hamilton]
I am [Oz, the great and terrible! Who are you and why do you seek me?
[Burr] Say something!
[HAMILTON] Uh... Elphaba Thropp your terribleness!
His Speaks Normally.
[Hamilton]
Oh? Is that you Elphaba? I didn't realize!
He Climbs Out Of The Head.
[Hamilton]
I hope I didn't startle you, it's so hard to make out peoples' faces all the way back there.
So, let's see... which is which? Elphaba! He grabs her hands. And you must be.
[Burr] Glinda. The Ga is silent.
Elphaba touches the Ozmask.
[Hamilton]
I know. It isn't much, is it? But people expect this sort of thing. You have to give people what they want.
The thing is, I hardly ever let people meet the real me, but this being special occasion.
[HAMILTON] I'm so happy to meet you.
[Hamilton]
Well, that's good. 'Cause that's what I love best] making people happy!
I AM A SENTIMENTAL MAN
WHO ALWAYS LONGED TO BE A FATHER
THAT'S WHY I DO THE BEST I CAN
TO TREAT EACH CITIZEN OF OzAS SON
OR DAUGHTER
SO ELPHABA I'D LIKE TO RAISE YOU HIGH
'CUZ I THINK EVERYONE DESERVES THE CHANCE TO FLY!
AND HELPING YOU WITH YOUR ASCENT
ALLOWS ME TO FEEL SO PARENTAL.
FOR I AM
A SENTIMENTAL MAN!
[HAMILTON] I'm here... we're here to alert you that something bad is happening...
[Hamilton]
Please, I'm the Wizard of [Oz. I already know why you've come.
Elphaba & [Burr] Oooo.
[Hamilton]
Of course, you must prove yourself...
[Burr] Prove yourself, prove yourself.
[HAMILTON] But how?
[Hamilton]
Oh, I don't know.
SOME SORT OF GESTURE
MOSTLY FOR SHOW
SOMETHING TO TEST YOUR ADEPTNESS..
I know! Madame, the book!
Morrible Enters.
[Burr] Madame Morrible...
[Hamilton]
I believe you're well acquainted with my new Press Secretary.
[HAMILTON] Press Secretary?
[Morrible]
 Oh, yes dearies, I've risen up in the world. You'll find that the Wizard is a very generous man.
If you do something for him, he'll do much for you.
[HAMILTON] What do yhou want me to do?
[Hamilton]
Well, this is my monkey servent, Chistery. He looks so longingly at the birds every morning....
[Morrible]
 So the Wizard was thinking, perhaps, a levitation spell...
[Burr] Noticing A Book In Morrible's Hands. Is that the Grimmerie?
[Morrible]
 Yes, the ancient book of spells and enchantments. Hands It To Elphaba.
[Burr] Whispers. Can I touch it?
Morrlbe] Whispers. No!
[HAMILTON] What funny writing...
[Morrible]
 Well it's a lost language. The lost language of spells.
[Hamilton]
It's kind of a recipe book for change.
[Morrible]
 Don't be discouraged if you can't decipherate it, dearie.
I, myself, can only read a spell or two, and that took years and years
[HAMILTON]
AHVEN, TATEY, AVEN TATEY AVEN...
[Hamilton]
She Continues Chanting. Oh, Chistery, what a experience you are about to have!
[HAMILTON] .................................. AH MAY AH TAY ATUM
[Hamilton]
SINCE ONCE I HAVE MY OWN DAY IN THE SKY...
[HAMILTON] AH MAY AH TAH TAY MAY TU SE SAY TA!
[Hamilton]
I KNOW EVERYONE DESERVES THE CHANCE TO FLY!
Chistery Screams & Begins To Twitch.
[HAMILTON] What happened? Is something wrong?
[Morrible]
 No just a transition, dearie.
[HAMILTON] No, stop you're hurting him!
[Hamilton]
She's actually done it!
Chistery Sprouts Wings. And Begins Running Around The Stage.
[HAMILTON] NO! Quick, how do I reverse it?
[Morrible]
 You can't!
[HAMILTON] What?!
[Morrible]
 You can't! Spells are irreversible! I knew she had the power, I told you!
[HAMILTON] You planned all this?
[Morrible]
 Well, you benefit too, dearie! You benefit, too.
[Hamilton]
And this is only the beginning! Look.
The Other Monkeys Begin To Grow Wings And Fly.
[Morrible]
 Won't they make perfect spies?
[HAMILTON] Spies?!
[Hamilton]
You're right, that's a harsh word... how about scouts? That's what they'll be really. They'll fly around [Oz! Report any subversive Animal activity.
[HAMILTON] You can't read this book at all! Can you? That's why you need enemies, and cages, and spies. You have no real power.
[Hamilton]
Exactly... that's why I need you. Don't you see? The world is your oyster, now! You have so many...opportunites. You both do.
[Burr] Thank you, your [Ozness.
Wizard]
SINCE ONCE I HAD MY OWN DAY IN THE SKY
I KNOW EVERYONE DESERVES THE CHANCE TO...
[HAMILTON] NO!
She Runs Off.
[Morrible]
 Elphaba!
[Burr] Elphie! I am so sorry, your Wizardship. I'll fetch her back! Elphie wait!
She Runs After Her.
[Hamilton]
We must get her back. She knows too much.
[Morrible]
 Don't worry! I will handle it.
He Gets Back In The Head. Speaking, Again, With A Powerful Voice.
[Hamilton]
Guards, guards! There is a fugitive loose in the palace! Find her, capture her, and bring her to me!
Guards] Yes your [Ozness!

[Burr] Elphie, wait! Where are you going?
[HAMILTON] Oh no! There are no more stairs! This might be the attic...
[Burr] Elphaba, listen to me...
[HAMILTON] I have to barricade the door! She Picks Up A Broom And Places It Over A Trap Door.
[Burr] Elphaba, why couldn't you have stayed calm for once instead of flying off the handle?
I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY
I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY NOW
I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY HOW YOU'VE HURT YOUR CAUSE FOREVER
I HOPE YOU THINK YOU'RE CLEVER
[HAMILTON]
I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY! I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY TOO
I HOPE YOU'RE PROUD HOW YOU WOULD GROVEL IN SUBMISSION
TO FEED YOUR OWN AMBISSION
Both]
SO THOUGH I CAN'T IMAGINE HOW
I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY
RIGHT NOW...
[Morrible]
 Citizens of [Oz, there is an enemy that must be found and captured! Believe nothing she says. She's evil. Responsible for the mutilation of these poor, innocent monkeys! Her green skin is but an outward manifestation of her twisted nature! This distortion... this repulsion... this... Wicked Witch!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[Burr] Don't be afraid...
[HAMILTON] I'm not... it's the Wizard who should be afraid... of me!
[Burr] Elphie, just say you're sorry before it's too late.
YOU CAN STILL BE WITH THE WIZARD
WHAT YOU'VE WORKED AND WAITED FOR
YOU CAN HAVE ALL YOU EVER WANTED...
[HAMILTON] I know...
BUT I DON'T WANT IT
NO, I CAN'T WANT IT
ANYMORE...
SOMETHING HAS CHANGED WITHIN ME
SOMETHING IS NOT THE SAME
I'M THROUGH WITH PLAYING BY THE RULES
OF SOMEONE ELSE'S GAME!
TOO LATE FOR SECOND GUESSING
TOO LATE TO GO BACK TO SLEEP
IT'S TIME TO TRUST MY INSTINCTS
CLOSE MY EYES...
AND LEAP
IT'S TIME TO TRY DEFYING GRAVITY
I THINK I'LL TRY DEFYING GRAVITY
AND YOU CAN'T PULL ME DOWN
[Burr]
CAN'T I MAKE YOU UNDERSTAND
YOU'RE HAVING DELUSIONS OF GRANDURE?
[HAMILTON]
I'M THROUHG EXCEPTING LIMITS
'CUZ SOMEONE SAYS THEY'RE SO
SOME THINGS I CANNOT CHANGE,
BUT 'TIL I TRY I'LL NEVER KNOW!
TOO LONG I'VE BEEN AFRAID OF
LOSING LOVE I GUESS I'D LOST
WELL IF THAT'S LOVE,
IT COMES AT MUCH TOO HIGH A COST!
I'D SOONER BUY DEFYING GRAVITY
KISS ME GOODBYE I'M DEFYING GRAVITY
AND YOU CAN'T PULL ME DOWN!
The Guards Bang On The Locked Door.
[Guard]
 Open this door, in the name of his supreme [Ozness!
[HAMILTON] Ah May Ah Tay Ah Tum Ditum...
[Burr]
That's what started all this in the first place... that hideous levitation spell! STOP!!!
[Burr] Well... Where are your wings? Maybe you're not as powerful as you think you are...
A Broomstick Floats Across The Room Towards Elphaba.
[HAMILTON] I told you, Glinda... I did it, I tell ya!
The Guards Bang On The Door Once Again.
[HAMILTON] Quick! Get on!
[Burr] What?
[HAMILTON] Come with me... think of what we could do... together.
UNLIMITED, TOGETHER WE'RE UNLIMITED
TOGETHER WE'LL BE THE GREATEST TEAM THERE'S EVER BEEN, GLINDA
DREAMS THE WAY WE PLANNED 'EM
[Burr]
IF WE WORK IN TANDEM
Both]
JUST YOU AND I DEFYING GRAVITY
WITH YOU AND I DEFYING GRAVITY
[HAMILTON]
THEY'LL NEVER BRING US DOWN.
Well, are you coming?
[Burr] Elphie, you're trembling... here, put this around you...
She Drapes A Black Cape Around Her.
I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY
NOW THAT YOU'RE CHOOSING THIS
[HAMILTON] You too.
I HOPE IT BRINGS YOU BLISS
Both]
I REALLY HOPE YOU GET IT
AND YOU DON'T LIVE TO REGRET IT
I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY IN THE END!
I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY...
MY FRIEND...
Elphaba Runs Off. The Guards Break Down The Door.
[Guard]
 There she is! Don't let her get away!
They Grab Hold Of Glinda.
[Burr]
What in [Oz?! Let go of me! Do you hear me? Let go!
[HAMILTON]
It's not her. She has nothing to do with. I'm the one you want. It's me. Hahahahaha. It's me! Up here! It's me!
She Rises Up Center Stage Holding Her Broom.
[HAMILTON]
SO IF YOU CARE TO FIND ME,
LOOK TO THE WESTERN SKY
AS SOMEONE TOLD ME LATELY,
EVERYONE DESERVES THE CHANCE TO FLY!
AND IF I'M FLYING SOLO,
AT LEAST I'M FLYING FREE!
TO THOSE WHO GROUND ME,
TAKE A MESSAGE BACK FROM ME!
TELL THEM HOW I AM DEFYING GRAVITY!!!
I'M FLYING HIGH DEFYING GRAVITY!!!
AND SOON I'LL MATCH THEM IN RENOWN
AND NOBODY
IN ALL OF [Oz...

END ACT I - Wicked Musical Script -

ACT II


The Act Opens With [Ozians.

[Ozia]

EVERY DAY THE WICKED
EVERY DAY THE TERROR GROWS
ALL OF OzIS EVER ON ALERT
THAT'S THE WAY WITH WICKED-
SPREADING FEAR WHERE E'ER SHE GOES
SEEKING OUT NEW VICTIMS SHE CAN HURT!
[Ozian Woman]
LIKE SOME TERRIBLE GREEN BLIZZARD
THROUGHOUT THE LAND SHE FLIES...
[Ozian Man]
DEFAMING OUR POOR WIZARD
[Ozia]

WITH HER CALUMNIES AND LIES
SHE LIES!
SAVE US FROM THE WICKED
SHIELD US SO WE WON'T BE HEXED
GIVE US WARNING
WHERE WILL SHE STRIKE NEXT
WHERE WILL SHE STRIKE NEXT
WHERE WILL SHE STRIKE NEXT
Glinda, Fiyero and Morrible Appear Onstage On APodium.
[Burr] Fellow [Ozians, as terrifying as terror is, let us put aside our panic for this one day... and celebrate!
OH WHAT A CELEBRATION WE'LL HAVE TODAY!
[Ozia]

THANK GOODNESS!
[Burr]
LET'S HAVE A CELEBRATION THE GLINDA WAY!
[Ozia]

THANK GOODNESS!
[Morrible]

FINALLY A DAY THAT'S TOTALLY WICKED WITCH FREE
All]
WE COULDN'T BE HAPPIER
THANK GOODNESS!
[Morrible]
 And thank goodness for you, Glinda, and your handsome swain, our new captain of the guard.
To Fiyero. Now you've been at the forefront of the hunt for the Wicked Witch, haven't you?
[BURR]
 Not really, but I don't like to think of her as a Wicked Witch.
[Morrible]
 Captain, how does it feel?
[BURR]
 Frustrating... but I became captain of the guard to find her, and I will keep searching!
[Morrible]
 No, being engaged!
[Ozia]
 Congratulotions!
[BURR]
 To Glinda - Confused. This is an engagement party?
[Burr] Surprised?
[BURR]
 Yes!
[Burr] Good, we hoped you'd be... the Wizard and I!
WE COULDN'T BE HAPPIER
RIGHT DEAR?
COULDN'T BE HAPPIER
RIGHT HERE
LOOK WHAT WE'VE GOT
A FAIRY TALE PLOT
OUR VERY OWN HAPPY ENDING
WHERE WE COULDN'T BE HAPPIER
TRUE DEAR?
COULDN'T BE HAPPIER
AND WE'RE HAPPY TO SHARE OUR ENDING VICARIOUSLY
WITH ALL OF YOU!
HE COULDN'T LOOK HANDSOMER
I COULDN'T BE HUMBLER
BECAUSE HAPPY IS WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN ALL YOUR DREAMS COME TRUE...
[Morrible]
 And Glinda, dear, we're happy for you! As Press Secretary,
I have striven to ensure that all of Ozknows the story of your braverism! How I vividly remember...
THE DAY YOU WERE FIRST SUMMONED
TO AN AUDIENCE WITH [Oz,
AND ALTHOUGH HE WOULD NOT TELL YOU WHY INITIALLY
WHEN YOU BOWED BEFORE HIS THROWN
HE DECREED YOU'D HENCE BE KNOWN
AS GLINDA THE GOOD
OFFICIALLY!
[BURR]
 That's not how you described it to me.
[Burr] Oh no, not exactly, but Whispers we'll talk about it later.
[Morrible]

THEN WITH A JEALOUS SQUEEE
THE WICKED WITCH BURST FROM CONCEALMENT
WHERE SHE HAD BEEN LURKING
SURREPTITIALLY!
Gasps From Among The Crowd.
[Ozian]
I HEAR SHE HAS AN EXTRA EYE THAT ALWAYS REMAINS AWAKE!
[Ozian]
I HEAR THAT SHE CAN SHED HER SKIN AS EASILY AS A SNAKE!
[Ozian]
I HEAR SOME REBEL ANIMALS ARE GIVING HER FOOD AND SHELTER!
[Ozian]
I HEAR HER SOUL IS SO UNCLEAN, PURE WATER CAN MELT HER!
[BURR]
 What?
[Ozia]

MELT HER! PLEASE SOMEBODY GO AND MELT HER!
[BURR]
 Do you hear that?! Water will melt her? People are so empty-headed they'll believe anything!
[Burr] Excuse me just a tick-tock!
Her And Fiyero Talk Aside.
[BURR]
 I can't just stand here grinning pretending to go along with all of this!
[Burr] Do you think I like to hear them say those awful things about her? I hate it!
[BURR]
 Then what are we doing here? Let's go, let's get out of here!
[Burr] We can't leave now, not when people are looking to us to raise their spirits.
[BURR]
 You can't leave, because you can't resist this. And that is the truth.
[Burr] Maybe I can't. Is that so wrong? Who could?
[BURR]
 You know who could. Who has.
[Burr] Fiyero, I miss her too, but we can't just stop living. No one has searched harder for her than you. But don't you see? She doesn't want to be found. We have to face it.
[BURR]
 You're right. I'm sorry, you're right. And if it's going tol make you happy, of course I'll marry you.
[Burr] But it'll make you happy too, right?
[BURR]
 You know me... I'm always happy. He Runs Off.
[Burr] Fiyero! Thanks plenty dearest! He's gone to fetch me a refreshment, he's so thoughtful that way!
THAT'S WHY I COULDN'T BE HAPPIER
NO, I COULDN'T BE HAPPIER
THOUGH IT IS I ADMIT, THE TINIEST BIT
UNLIKE I ANTICIPATED,
BUT I COULDN'T BE HAPPIER
SIMPLY COULDN'T BE HAPPIER...
Well, not simply...
'CUZ GETTING YOUR DREAMS, IT'S STRANGE BUT IT SEEMS
A LITTLE, WELL, COMPLICATED...
THERE'S A KIND OF A SORT OF COST
THERE'S A COUPLE OF THINGS GET LOST...
THERE ARE BRIDGES YOU CROSSED YOU DIDN'T KNOW YOU CROSSED UNTIL YOU'VE CROSSED!
AND IF THAT JOY THAT THRILL
DOESN'T THRILL LIKE YOU THINK IT WILL...
STILL... WITH THIS PERFECT FINALE
THE CHEERS AND THE BALLYHOO
WHO WOULDN'T BE HAPPIER?
SO I COULDN'T BE HAPPIER
BECAUSE HAPPY IS WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN ALL YOUR DREAMS COME TRUE...
WELL, ISN'T IT?
HAPPY IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOUR DREAMS COME...
TRUE!!!!
[Ozia]

WE LOVE YOU GLINDA IF WE MAY BE SO FRANK!
[Burr]
THANK GOODNESS!
[Ozia]

FOR ALL THIS JOY WE KNOW WHO WE'VE GOT TO THANK!
THANK GOODNESS!
THAT MEANS THE WIZARD, GLINDA...
[Burr]
AND FIANCE!
[Ozia]

THEY COULDN'T BE GOODLIER
SHE COULDN'T BE LOVLIER
WE COULDN'T BE LUCKIER!
[Burr] I COULDN'T BE HAPPIER!!!
[Ozia]
 THANK GOODNESS!!!
[Burr] TODAY!!!!
[Ozia]
 TODAY, THANK GOODNESS FOR TODAY!


[Angelica]
 Will there be anything else, Madame?
[Angelica]
 I've asked you to call me Nessarose, remember?
[Angelica]
 Yes, Madame. He Exits.
[Angelica]
 LAFAYETE...
Elphaba's Voice Is Heard Inside A Closet.
[HAMILTON] Well, it seems the beautiful only get more beautiful, Nessarose Screams while the green just get greener.
Nessarose Is Scared And Confused.
Elphaba Steps Out Of The Closet.
[HAMILTON] I'm sorry. Did I scare you? I seem to have that effect on people. It's good to see you.
[Angelica]
 What are you doing here?
[HAMILTON] Well, there's no place like home. I never thought I'd hear myself say this but I need father's help. I need him to stand with me.
[Angelica]
 That's impossible.
[HAMILTON] No, no it's not. Not if you ask him. You know he'll listen to you.
[Angelica]
 Father's dead.
[HAMILTON] What?
[Angelica]
 He's dead. I'm the governor... Well what did you expect? After he learned what you'd done,
how you'd disgraced u,s he died... of shame. Embarrassed to death.
[HAMILTON] Good, I'm glad. It's better that way.
[Angelica]
 That's a wicked thing to say.
[HAMILTON] No, it's true. Because now it's just us. You can help me and together we can...
[Angelica]
 Elphaba, shut up! First of all, I can't harbor a fugitive, I'm an un-elected official!
And why should I help you? You fly around [Oz, trying to rescue animals you've never even met,
and not once have you ever thought to use your powers to rescue me!
ALL OF MY LIFE, I'VE DEPENDED ON YOU
HOW DO YOU THINK THAT FEELS?
ALL OF MY LIFE I'VE DEPENDED ON YOU
AND THIS HIDEOUS CHAIR WITH WHEELS!
SCROUNGING FOR SCRAPS OF PITY TO PICK UP
AND LONGING TO KICK UP
MY HEELS...
[HAMILTON] Nessa, there isn't a spell for everything! The power is mysterious.
It's not like coddling up a pair of... She Pulls Out The Grimmerie From Her Bag. Wait.
[Angelica]
 What are you doing?
Elphaba Begins Chanting.
[Angelica]
 What is that? Ah! My shoes! It feels like... like they're on fire! What have you done to my shoes???
She Lifts Her Dress, Revealing The Ruby Slippers. Nessarose Stands, But Falls. Elphaba Gives Her A Hand.
[Angelica]
 No, don't help me. She Stands.
[HAMILTON] Oh, Nessa, at last...
I'VE DONE WHAT LONG AGO I SHOULD
AND FINALLY FROM THESE POWERS SOMETHING GOOD
FINALLY SOMETHING GOOD...
[Angelica]
 LAFAYETE! LAFAYETE! Come quickly!
[HAMILTON] LAFAYETE?
[Angelica]
 LAFAYETE! Come here at once!
[HAMILTON] No! Nessa, listen, nobody can know I'm here!
Nessarose Runs Behind The Closet As LAFAYETE Enters.
[Angelica]
 Yes, what is it, Madame?
[HAMILTON] LAFAYETE...
[Angelica]
 What are you doing here? You stay back!
[HAMILTON] LAFAYETE, it's just me, I'm not going to hurt you!
[Angelica]
 No! You're lying! That's all you ever do! You and your sister! She's as wicked as you are!
[HAMILTON] What are you talking about?
[Angelica]
 I'm talking about my life. The little that's left of it. I'm not free to leave Munchkinland, none of us are.
Ever since she took power, she's been stripping the Munchkins of our rights...
and we didn't have that many to begin with! And do you know why?
Nessarose Reveals Herself In The Chair.
[Angelica]
 To keep you here, with me. But none of that matters anymore. Look.
Nessarose Stands Up.
[Angelica]
 To Elphaba. You did this for her?
[Angelica]
 For both of us!
[Angelica]
 Nessa, this changes everything.
[Angelica]
 I know.
[Angelica]

LISTEN NESSA...
[Angelica]
 What?
[Angelica]

UH NESSA, SURELY NOW I'LL MATTER LESS TO YOU
AND YOU WON'T MIND MY LEAVING HERE TONIGHT...
[Angelica]
 Leaving?
[Angelica]
 Yes...
THAT BALL THAT'S BEING STAGED
ANNOUNCING GLINDA IS ENGAGED
[Angelica]
 Glinda?
[Angelica]

YES NESSA THAT'S RIGHT!
I'VE GOT TO GO APPEAL TO HER
EXPRESS THE WAY I FEEL TO HER
Oh, Nessa, I lost my heart to Glinda from the moment I first saw her. You know that.
[Angelica]
 Lost your heart? Well, we'll see about that...
[HAMILTON] Nessa, let him go...
[Angelica]

DID YOU THINK I'D LET YOU LEAVE ME HERE FLAT?
[Angelica]
 Don't come any closer!
YOU'RE GOING TO LOSE YOUR HEART TO ME, I TELL YOU!
IF I HAVE TO... I HAVE TO...
Sees The Grimmerie.
MAGIC SPELL YOU...
She Grabs The Book.
[Angelica]
 Ah... Tum... Tah... Tae...
Elphaba Reveals Herself.
[HAMILTON] Nessa, stop!
[Angelica]
 What is she doing?!
[HAMILTON] No, Nessa, you're pronouncing the words all wrong!
[HAMILTON] Nessa!
[Angelica]
 LAFAYETE! What is it?
[Angelica]
 Gasps. My heart feels like it's... shrinking.
[Angelica]
 Elphaba, do something!
[HAMILTON] I can't! You can't reverse a spell once it's been cast!
[Angelica]
 So what do we do?
LAFAYETE Falls Into Nessa's Empty Wheel Chair. Elphaba Wheels Him Behind The Closet.
[Angelica]
 Elphaba, do something!
[Angelica]
 This is all your fault! If you hadn't shown me that horrendible book.
[HAMILTON] I have to find another spell... it's the only thing that might work. She Goes Behind The Closet As Well.
[Angelica]
 Save him, please!
JUST SAVE HIM, MY POOR LAFAYETE, MY SWEET MY BRAVE,
DON'T LEAVE ME 'TIL MY SORRY LIFE HAS CEASED...
Elphaba Wheels The Chair Out, Which Is Not Facing The Audience And Is Seen Casting A Spell.
ALL ALONE AND LOVELESS HERE
JUST THE GIRL IN THE MIRROR
JUST HER AND ME! THE WICKED WITCH OF THE EAST!
WE DESERVE EACH OTHER...
[Angelica]
 Well... what about his heart?
[HAMILTON] It's all right. He won't need one now. I have to go. I have business to attend to in the Emerald City.
Nessa, I have done everything I could for you but it has never been enough and it never will be...
She Leaves.
[Angelica]
 Elphaba, wait! Elphaba!
LAFAYETE Wakes Up.
[Angelica]
 Where am I? What happened?
[Angelica]
 Nothing, LAFAYETE, you just fell asleep... and...
He Sits Up, Squeaking. He Is Made Of Tin. Nessarose Screams.
[Angelica]
 What is it, what's wrong?
[Angelica]
 No, it wasn't me it was her! I tried to stop her.
LAFAYETE Screams Uncontrollably And Runs Off.
[Angelica]
 LAFAYETE, please listen! It was Elphaba! LAFAYETE! It was Elphaba!!!

[Hamilton]
[HAMILTON] Well you have, you have harmed me.
[Hamilton]
I realize that, and I regret it. Elphaba...
[HAMILTON] There you are! I'm setting those monkeys free! And don't try to interfere, or call the guards...
[Hamilton]
I'm not calling anyone. The truth is I'm glad to see you again. It gets pretty lonely around here. And I know you must get lonely too.
[HAMILTON] You don't know the first thing about me.
[Hamilton]
Oh, but I do. I do know you. I can't explain it exactly. You know what I mean? Elphaba, you've been so strong through all of this, aren't you tired of being the strong one? Wouldn't you like someone to take care of you? He Hands Her Back The Broom. Please, help me start again.
[HAMILTON] Don't you think I wish I could? That I could go back to the time when I believed you really were wonderful? The Wonderful Wizard of [Oz? Nobody believed in you more than I did.
[Hamilton]
Oh, my dear child...
I NEVER ASKED FOR THIS OR PLANNED IT IN ADVANCE
I WAS MERELY BLOWN HERE BY THE WINDS OF CHANCE
I NEVER SAW MYSELF AS A SOLOMON OR SOCRATES
I KNEW WHO I WAS, ONE OF YOUR DIME A D[OzEN MEDIOCRATES
THEN SUDDENLY I'M HERE, RESPECTED, WORSHIPED EVEN
JUST BECAUSE THE FOLKS IN OzNEEDED SOMEONE TO BELIEVE IN
DOES IT SURPRISE YOU I GOT HOOKED AND ALL TOO SOON
WHAT CAN I SAY? I GOT CARRIED AWAY
AND NOT JUST BY BALLOON...
WONDERFUL
THEY CALLED ME WONDERFUL
SO I SAID, WONDERFUL, IF YOU INSIST
I WILL BE WONDERFUL
AND THEY SAID WONDERFUL
BELIEVE ME IT'S HARD TO RESIST
'CUZ IT FEELS WONDERFUL
THEY THINK I'M WONDERFUL
HEY LOOK WHO'S WONDERFUL
THIS CORN-FED HICK!
WHO SAID IT MIGHT BE KEEN
TO BUILD A TOWN OF GREEN
AND A WONDERFUL ROAD OF YELLOW BRICK!
See, I never had a family of my own since I was always traveling, and I guess I just wanted to give the citizens of Ozeverything.
[HAMILTON] So you lied to them?
[Hamilton]
Only verbally. Besides, they were the lies they wanted to hear. Elphaba, where I come from we believe all sorts of things that aren't true... we call it history!
A MAN'S CALLED A TRAITOR
OR LIBERATOR
A RICH MAN'S A THIEF
OR PHILANTHROPIST
IS ONE A CRUSADER
OR RUTHLESS INVADER
IT'S ALL IN THE LABEL WHICH IS ABLE TO PERSIST
THERE ARE PRECIOUS FEW AT EASE
WITH MORAL AMBIGUITIES
SO WE ACT AS THOUGH THEY DON'T EXIST...
THEY CALL ME WONDERFUL
SO I AM
INFACT, IT'S SO MUCH WHO I AM IT'S PART OF MY NAME!
AND WITH MY HELP YOU CAN BE THE SAME...
AT LONG, LONG LAST RECEIVE YOUR DUE
LONG OVERDUE
ELPHABA, THE MOST CELEBRATED
ARE THE REHABILITATED
THERE'LL SUCH A WHOOPDEE DOO!
A CELEBRATION THROUGHOUT [Oz,
THAT'S ALL TO DO WITH YOU!
WONDERFUL, THEY'LL CALL YOU WONDERFUL!
[HAMILTON]
THAT DOES SOUND WONDERFUL!
Wizard]
TRUST ME IT'S FUN!!!
Both]
WHEN YOU ARE WONDERFUL,
IT WOULD BE WONDERFUL!
WONDERFUL, WONDERFUL
Wizard]
ONE, TWO AND...
They Dance.
[HAMILTON]
I'LL ACCEPT YOUR PROPOSITION
[Hamilton]
Wonderful
[HAMILTON]
ON ONE CONDITION
[Hamilton]
Yes?
[HAMILTON] You set those Monkeys free.
[Hamilton]
Done.

[HAMILTON] Go! Fly! You're Free! Fly! Chistery, Chistery, you're free, isn't it wonderful?! Go, fly! She Makes Her Way To Another "Monkey" Covered By A Sheet.
[Hamilton]
No! No! Please!
She Pulls Off The Cover, Revealing Dr. Dillamond.
[HAMILTON] No! It can't be! Doctor Dillamond...
[Hamilton]
Elphaba, we just couldn't keep letting him speak out...
[HAMILTON] Doctor Dillamond, are you alright? Don't be afraid. It's me, Elphaba.
[Hamilton]
 Bahhhhh.
[HAMILTON] Doctor, don't you remember me?
[Hamilton]
 Bahhhhh.
[HAMILTON] Can't you speak?
[Hamilton]
 Bahhhhh.
[HAMILTON] No... We have nothing in common. I am nothing like you and I never will be and I will fight you until the day I die!!!
The Wizard Climbs Into The Head And Dr. Dillamond Runs Offstage.

[Hamilton]
Guards, guards!!!
Fiyero Runs In With His Men.
[Guard]
 Halt!
[BURR]
 Are you alright, your [Ozness?
[HAMILTON] Fiyero!
[BURR]
 I don't believe it...
[HAMILTON] Oh , Fiyero, thank God. I thought you were...
[BURR]
 Silence witch!!!
[Guard]
 There's a Goat on the lam, sir.
[BURR]
 Never mind all that. Fetch me some... some water.
[Guard]
 Water, sir?
[BURR]
 You heard me, as much as you can carry.
Guards] Yes, sir!
They March Off.
[HAMILTON] Fiyero...
[BURR]
 I said silence!
[Hamilton]
He Runs Out Of The Head. No! No!
[BURR]
 Don't make a sound, your [Ozness, unless you want all your guests to know the truth about the Wonderful Wizard of [Oz... Elphaba, I'll find Doctor Dillamond later, no get out of here.
[HAMILTON] Fiyero, you frightened me. I thought, I though you might have changed.
[BURR]
 I have... changed.
Glinda Enters.
[Burr] What's going on... Elphie? Oh, thank Ozyou're alive! Only you shouldn't have come. If anyone discoverates you ...
[BURR]
 Glinda, you'd better go.
[Burr] Fiyero, what are you...
[BURR]
 Please, just go back to the ball.
[Burr] Your [Ozness, he means no disrespectation. Please understand! You see, we all went to school together...
[BURR]
 Elphaba!
[Burr] Fiyero, have you misplaced your mind? What are you doing?
[BURR]
 I'm going with her.
[Burr] What? What are you saying? You mean all this time... the two of you... behind my back...
[HAMILTON] No, Glinda it wasn't like that!
[BURR]
 Actually, it was...but it wasn't...Elphaba, let's go... let's go!
They Run Off.
[Burr] Fine, go! You deserve each other...
The Wizard Holds A Small Bottle With A Green Liquid.
[Hamilton]
Here, have a swig of this, it dulls the pain.
[Burr] No, thank you.
Mme. Morrible Enters, Laughing.
[Morrible]
 Oh, is it true? Your betrothed has taken her into custody?
[Hamilton]
Our new captain of the guard had other plans.
[Morrible]
 You mean she hasn't been captured?
[Hamilton]
Quite the contrary. And considering how well she eluded us last time...
[Morrible]
 Well, we'll just flush her out and force her to show herself.
[Hamilton]
But how?
[Burr] Her sister
[Morrible]
 What? What did she say?
[Burr] Use her sister. Spread a rumor. Make her think her sister is in trouble and she will fly to her side... and you'll have her.
[Hamilton]
Exactly so.
[Burr] Now, if your [Ozness will excuse me I have a slight headache, I think I'll lie down.
She Walks Out.
[Morrible]
 Yes, well...a rumor won't do it. Elphaba's too smart for that.
[Hamilton]
Far too smart.
[Morrible]
 Perhaps, a change in the weather...

[Burr]
DON'T WISH, DON'T START
WISHING ONLY WOUNDS THE HEART...
THERE'S A GIRL I KNOW, HE LOVES HER SO...
I'M NOT THAT GIRL...

Only Elphaba & Fiyero Are On Stage, In The Woods
[HAMILTON]
KISS ME TOO FIERCELY, HOLD ME TOO TIGHT
I NEED HELP BELIEVING YOU'RE WITH ME TONIGHT
MY WILDEST DREAMINGS COULD NOT FORSEE
LYING BESIDE YOU WITH YOU WANTING ME
IF JUST FOR THIS MOMENT
AS LONG AS YOU'RE MINE
I'VE LOST ALL RESISTANCE
AND CROSSED SOME BORDERLINE
AND IF IT TURNS OUT
IT'S OVER TOO FAST
I'LL MAKE EVERY LAST MOMENT LAST
AS LONG AS YOU'RE MINE...
[BURR]

MAYBE I'M BRAINLESS, MAYBE I'M WISE,
BUT YOU'VE GOT ME SEEING THROUGH DIFFERENT EYES,
SOMEHOW I'VE FALLEN UNDER YOUR SPELL
AND SOMEHOW I'M FEELING
IT'S UP THAT I FELL
Both]
EVERY MOMENT, AS LONG AS YOU'RE MINE
I'LL WAKE UP MY BODY
AND MAKE UP FOR LOST TIME
[BURR]

SAY THERE'S NO FUTURE
FOR US AS A PAIR...
Both]
AND THOUGH I MAY KNOW,
I DON'T CARE
IF JUST FOR THIS MOMENT
AS LONG AS YOU'RE MINE
COME BE HOW YOU WANT TO
AND SEE HOW BRIGHT WE SHINE!
BORROW THE MOONLIGHT
UNTIL IT IS THROUGH
AND KNOW I'LL BE HERE HOLDING YOU...
AS LONG AS YOU'RE MINE...
[BURR]
 What is it?
[HAMILTON] It's just... for the first time... I feel... wicked.

[HAMILTON] I just wish...
[BURR]
 What?
[HAMILTON] I wish I could be beautiful... for you.
[BURR]
 Elphaba...
[HAMILTON] Don't tell me that I am, you don't need to lie to me.
[BURR]
 It's not lying! It's... uh... it's looking at things another way. Someday, you and Glinda will make up and we'll all...
[HAMILTON] Shh! Listen... Do you hear that? A Shriek Is Heard In The Distance. It sounds like somebody in pain.
[BURR]
 It's just the wind.
[HAMILTON] The Siren Is Heard Again. My sister's in danger.
[BURR]
 What? How do you know?
[HAMILTON] I don't know, I just do... Gasps.
[BURR]
 Elphaba what's wrong, what is it?
[HAMILTON] This! Don't you see it?
[BURR]
 What do you mean? What do you see?
[HAMILTON] It doesn't make any sense... It's a house but it's... it's flying through the sky? I have to go to Nessa!
[BURR]
 I'll come with you!
[HAMILTON] No, you mustn't, it's too dangerous!
[BURR]
 Listen to me, listen! My family has a castle in Kiamo Ko. Now, no one is ever there except for the sentries who watch over it. We've never lived there.
[HAMILTON] Where do you live?
[BURR]
 In the other castle... It's the perfect hiding place; tunnels, secret passageways. You'll be safe there.
[HAMILTON] We will see each other again, won't we?
[BURR]
 Elphaba, we are going to be together always. You can see houses flying through the sky, can't you see that?
They Embrace And Elphaba Runs Off.
Glinda Enters. There Is A House In The Background. The Edge OF The Yellow Brick Road Can Be Seen.
[Burr] That's right, you just take that one road, the whole time. Waves offstage. Oh, I hope they don't get lost. I'm so bad at giving directions. She sees the house, picks up flowers and lays them in front of the house. Oh, Nessa.
Elphaba Appears.
[HAMILTON] What a touching display of grief.
[Burr] I don't think we have anything further to say to one another.
[HAMILTON] I wanted something to remember her by, and all that is left were those shoes, and now that wretched little farm girl has walked off with them. So I'd appreciate some time, alone, to say goodbye to my sister.
Glinda Backs Away As Elphaba Walks Toward The House.
[HAMILTON] Nessa, please, please, please forgive me...
[Burr] Elphie... you mustn't blame yourself. It's dreadful, it is, to have a house fall on you, but accidents will happen.
[HAMILTON] You call this an accident?
[Burr] Yes! Well, maybe not an accident...
[HAMILTON] Well, what do you call it?
[Burr] Well... a regime change. Caused by a bizarre and unexpected twister of fate.
[HAMILTON] You think cyclones just appear out of the blue?
[Burr] I don't know, I never really...
[HAMILTON] No, of course you never! You're too busy telling everyone how wonderful everything is!
[Burr] I'm a public figure, now. People expect me to...
[HAMILTON] Lie?
[Burr] Be encouraging! And what exactly have you been doing besides riding around on that filthy, old thing?
[HAMILTON] Well, we can't all come and go by bubble. Who's invention was that, the Wizard's? Of course, even if it wasn't I'm sure he'd still take credit for it.
[Burr] Yes, well, a lot of us are taking things that don't belong to us, aren't we?
[HAMILTON] Now wait just a clock tick! I know it may be difficult for that blissful, blonde brain of yours to comprehend that someone like him could actually choose someone like me! But it's happened... it's real. And you can wave that ridiculous wand all you want, you can't change it! He never belonged to you, he doesn't love you, and he never did! He loves me!
Glinda Slaps Her.
[HAMILTON] Cackles. Feel better now?
[Burr] Yes, I do.
[HAMILTON] Good, so do I.
She Slaps Glinda. Glinda Then Twirls Her Wand Skillfully And Elphaba Arms Herself With Her Broom. They Charge At Each Other And Then Drop Their "Weapons" And Beat Each Other Senselessly. Glinda Takes Elphaba's Hat Off Her Head And Begins To Whack Her With It. The Guards Run In.
[Guard]
 Halt! In the name of the Wizard!
They Grab Elphaba.
[HAMILTON] Stop! Let me go!
[Burr] Let me go, I almost had her!
[Guard]
 Sorry it took us so long to get here, Miss.
[HAMILTON] I can't believe you would sink this low! To use my sister's death as a trap to capture me?!
[Burr] I never meant for this to happen! Elphie!
Fiyero Swings In On A Rope.
[BURR]
 Let the green girl go!
[Burr] Fiyero, how in [Oz?
[BURR]
 I said let her go! Or explain to all Ozhow the Wizard's guards watched while Glinda the Good was slain.
[Burr] Fiyero...
[BURR]
 I said, let her go.
The Guards Release Her.
[BURR]
 Elphaba, go, now.
[HAMILTON] No, not without you.
[Burr] Fiyero, please.
[BURR]
 Hush! Now! Go!
Elphaba Hesitates.
[Burr] Do it!
She Runs Off.
[Guard]
 Seize him!
[Burr] Wait, what?! What are you doing? Stop it! In the name of goodness, stop! Don't you see? He wasn't going to harm me, he just... he just... he loves her.
[BURR]
 Glinda, I'm so sorry!
[Guard]
 Take him up to that field there! Put him on one of those poles until he tells us where the witch went.
They Drag Him Offstage.
[Burr] No, don't hurt him! Please, don't hurt him! Fiyero!!!!
[HAMILTON] Fiyero!!!!
ELEKA NAHMEN NAHMEN ATUM ATUM ELEKA NAHMEN
ELEKA NAHMEN NAHMEN ATUM ATUM ELEKA NAHMEN
LET HIS FLESH NOT BE TORN LET HIS BLOOD LEAVE NO STAIN,
WILL THEY BEAT HIM, LET HIM FEEL NO PAIN...
LET HIS BONES NEVER BREAK AND HOWEVER THEY TRY TO DESTROY HIM,
LET HIM NEVER DIE, LET HIM NEVER DIE!
ELEKA NAHMEN NAHMEN ATUM ATUM ELEKA NAHMEN
ELEKA NAHMEN NAHMEN ATUM ATUM ELEKA... ELEKA
AH! WHAT GOOD IS THIS CHANTING?
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT I'M READING
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT TRICK I OUGHT TO TRY!
FIYERO WHERE ARE YOU?! ALREADY DEAD OR BLEEDING?
ONE MORE DISASTER I CAN ADD TO MY GENEROUS SUPPLY!
NO GOOD DEED GOES UNPUNISHED
NO ACT OF CHARITY GOES UNRESENTED
NO GOOD DEED GOES UNPUNISHED
THAT'S MY NEW CREED
MY ROAD OF GOOD INTENTIONS
LED WHERE SUCH ROADS ALWAYS LEAD
NO GOOD DEED
GOES UNPUNISHED!
NESSA...
DOCTOR DILLAMOND...
FIYERO...
FIYERO!!!
ONE QUESTION HAUNTS AND HURTS
TOO MUCH, TOO MUCH TO MENTION
WAS I REALLY SEEKING GOOD
OR JUST SEEKING ATTENTION?
IS THAT ALL GOOD DEEDS ARE WHEN LOOKED AT WITH AN ICE COLD EYE?
IF THAT'S ALL GOOD DEEDS ARE
MAYBE THAT'S THE REASON WHY
NO GOOD DEED GOES UNPUNISHED
ALL HELPFUL URGES SHOULD BE CIRCUMVENTED
NO GOOD DEED GOES UNPUNISHED
SURE, I MEANT WELL, WELL LOOK AT WHAT WELL MEANT DID!
ALRIGHT, ENOUGH, SO BE IT!
SO BE IT THEN...
LET ALL OF OzBE AGREED
I'M WICKED THROUGH AND THROUGH
SINCE I COULD NOT SUCCEED
FIYERO SAVING YOU
I PROMISE NO GOOD DEED WILL I ATTEMPT TO DO AGAIN
EVER AGAIN!
NO GOOD DEAD, WILL I DO
AGAIN!!!!!!!!

[Ozia]

GO! AND HUNT HER AND FIND HER AND KILL HER!
Vicious Woman] Good fortune, witch hunters!

[Ozia]

GO! AND HUNT HER AND FIND HER AND KILL HER!
Rabid Man] Kill the witch!
[Ozia]

WICKEDNESS MUST BE PUNISHED
EVIL EFFECTIVELY ELIMINATED
WICKEDNESS MUST BE PUNISHED
KILL THE WITCH!
[Angelica]
 And, this is more than just a service to the Wizard. I have a personal score to settle with Elph... with the witch! Crowd Cheers.
IT'S DUE TO HER I'M MADE OF TIN
HER SPELL MADE THIS OCCUR
SO FOR ONCE I'M GLAD I'M HEARTLESS
I'LL BE HEARTLESS KILLING HER!
And I am not the only one. Looks Offstage. Oh, come on, you! Come out and tell them what she did to you in class that day. How you were just a cub and she cubnapped you.
Lion] No!
[Angelica]

YOU SEE THE LION ALSO
HAS A GRIEVANCE TO REPAY (Lion Roars)
IF SHE'D LET HIM FIGHT HIS OWN BATTLES WHEN HE WAS YOUNG,
HE WOULDN'T BE A COWARD TODAY!

[Burr] No, no, that's not the way it happened! Madame, you've got to stop this, it's gone too far!
[Morrible]
 Oh, I think Elphaba can take care of herself.
[Burr] Madame, something's been troubling me about Nessarose and that cyclone.
[Morrible]
 Oh yes... well, I guess it was just her time.
[Burr] Was it? Or did you...
[Morrible]
 After A Pause. Now, you listen to me, Missy, you may have fooled the rest of Ozwith this "aren't I good" routine, but you know better. You've wanted this since the beginning... and now you're getting what you wanted. So just smile and wave and shut up! Good fortune, good fortune witch hunters!
Rapid Man] Kill her!
Vicious Woman] Kill the witch!
WICKEDNESS MUST BE PUNISHED
BRAVE WITCH HUNTERS I WOULD JOIN YOU IF I COULD
BECAUSE WICKEDNESS MUST BE PUNISHED...
PUNISHED... PUNISHED...
BUT GOOD!!!
[HAMILTON] Oh, for [Oz's sake, stop crying!!! I can't listen to it anymore! Oh, you want to see your Aunt Em and your Uncle What's-his-name again?! Then get those shoes off your feet!!! Little brat... takes a dead woman's shoes; must have been raised in a barn! Chistery! Oh, Chistery, there you are. Where are the others? Chistery motions away. Chistery, please... if you don't at least try to keep speaking you will never... She Sees Glinda. Go away.
[Burr] They're coming for you.
[HAMILTON] Go away!
[Burr] Let the little girl go, and that poor little dog... Dodo.
[Burr] I know you don't want to hear this, but someone has to say it... You are out of control! I mean, come on! They're just shoes, let it go! Elphaba, you can't go on like this.
[HAMILTON] I can do anything I want. I am the Wicked Witch of the West! Another monkey Brings Her A Letter. At last! What took you so long? She Reads It. What's this? Why are you bothering me with this? She Reads On.
[Burr] What is it? What's wrong? It's Fiyero, isn't it? Is he...
[HAMILTON] We've seen his face for the last time.
[Burr] Oh no!
[HAMILTON] You're right... It's time I surrender. Carries A Bucket.
[Burr] Elphie.... Elphie, what is it?
[HAMILTON] You can't be found here! You must go. Refers To A Corner
[Burr] No.
[HAMILTON] You must leave.
[Burr] No! Elphie, I'll tell them everything.
[HAMILTON] No! They'll only turn against you.
[Burr] I don't care!
[HAMILTON] I do! Promise me, promise me, you won't try to clear my name... promise.
[Burr] Alright... I promise. But I don't understand.
[HAMILTON]
I'M LIMITED
JUST LOOK AT ME, I'M LIMITED
AND JUST LOOK AT YOU, YOU CAN DO ALL I COULDN'T DO, GLINDA

[HAMILTON] Here. Go on. Take this. Hands Her The Grimmerie.
[Burr] Elphie... you know I can't read that... Elphie...
[HAMILTON] Well then, you'll have to learn
NOW IT'S UP TO YOU
FOR BOTH OF US
NOW IT'S UP TO YOU
[HAMILTON] You're the only friend I've ever had.
[Burr] And I've had so many friends... but only one that mattered.

[Burr]
I'VE HEARD IT SAID
THAT PEOPLE COME INTO OUR LIVES FOR A REASON
BRINGING SOMETHING WE MUST LEARN
AND WE ARE LED TO THOSE
WHO HELP US MOST TO GROW
IF WE LET THEM
AND WE HELP THEM IN RETURN
WELL, I DON'T KNOW IF I BELIEVE THAT'S TRUE
BUT I KNOW I'M WHO I AM TODAY
BECAUSE I KNEW YOU
LIKE A COMMIT PULLED FROM ORBIT,
AS IT PASSES A SUN
LIKE A STREAM THAT MEETS A BOULDER
HALF WAY THROUGH THE WOOD
WHO CAN SAY IF I'VE BEEN CHANGED FOR THE BETTER?
BUT, BECAUSE I KNEW YOU...
I HAVE BEEN CHANGED
FOR GOOD...
[HAMILTON]
IT WELL MAY BE,
THAT WE WILL NEVER MEET AGAIN
IN THIS LIFETIME
SO LET ME SAY BEFORE WE PART
SO MUCH OF ME
IS MADE OF WHAT I LEARNED FROM YOU
YOU'LL BE WITH ME
LIKE A HANDPRINT ON MY HEART...
AND NOW WHATEVER WAY OUR STORIES END
I KNOW YOU HAVE RE-WRITTEN MINE
BY BEING MY FRIEND...
LIKE A SHIP BLOWN FROM IT'S MOORING
BY A WIND OFF THE SEA
LIKE A SEA DROP BY A SKY BIRD
IN A DISTANT WOOD
WHO CAN SAY IF I'VE BEEN CHANGED FOR THE BETTER?
BUT BECAUSE I KNEW YOU
[Burr]
BECAUSE I KNEW YOU
Both]
I HAVE BEEN CHANGED...
FOR GOOD...
[HAMILTON]
AND JUST TO CLEAR THE AIR
I ASK FORGIVNESS FOR THE THINGS I'VE DONE
YOU BLAME ME FOR.
[Burr]
BUT THEN I GUESS, WE KNOW THERE'S BLAME TO SHARE
Both]
AND NONE OF IT SEEMS TO MATTER ANYMORE!
[Burr] LIKE A COMET PULLED FROM ORBIT AS IT PASSES A SUN...
[HAMILTON] LIKE A SHIP BLOWN FROM ITS MOORING BY A WIND OFF THE SEA
[Burr] LIKE A STREAM THAT MEETS A BOULDER
[HAMILTON] LIKE A SEA DROP BY A BIRD
[Burr] HALFWAY THROUGH THE WOOD
[HAMILTON] IN THE WOOD
[Burr]
WHO CAN SAY IF I'VE BEEN CHANGED FOR THE BETTER?
Both]
I DO BELIEVE I HAVE BEEN CHANGED FOR THE BETTER.
[Burr]
AND, BECAUSE I KNEW YOU
[HAMILTON]
BECAUSE I KNEW YOU
Both]
BECAUSE I KNEW YOU
I HAVE BEEN CHANGED
FOR GOOD...


[HAMILTON] You have to hide. No one can know you were here. Hide yourself!
Elphaba Drapes A Scrim Around The Stage
Offstage Chorus of Women]
AND GOODNESS KNOWS
THE WICKED'S LIVES ARE LONELY
GOODNESS KNOWS THE WICKED DIE ALONE...
LAFAYETE and Other Witch Hunters Run In. You Can See The Silhouette Of The Action Happening Behind The Scrim. Glinda Is Downstage Watching The Action Take Place.
The Mob Surrounds The Witch And She Melts With A Scream The Mob Leaves And Glinda Comes Out From Hiding. She Moves Near The Scrim.
[Burr] Elphie? Elphie? Chistery opens the scrim, where just Elphaba's hat and the green bottle remain. Glinda cries, and grabs the had, holding it against her.
Chistery] Handing Her The Bottle. Miss, Miss Glinda.
[Morrible]
 Well, I don't know why you're so despondiary, I thought it went quite well! They seem thrilled to shreds with their brains and their hearts, and this and that.... Glinda Enters. Oh, Miss Glinda! I thought you'd be out festivating.
[Burr] This was Elphaba's. Holding Out The Bottle.
[Hamilton]
What's that you say?
[Burr] It was a keepsake. It was her mother's. She told me so herself.
I've only seen a little, green bottle like this one other time. It was right here, in this very room. You offered me a drink from it.
Lover's Song Played In Background.
[Hamilton]
But... oh my Lord...
I AM A SENTIMENTAL MAN
WHO ALWAYS LONGED TO BE...
a father...
[Morrible]
 So that was it. That's why she had such powers! She was a child of both worlds!
[Hamilton]
He Cries.
[Burr] I want you to leave [Oz. I'll make the pronouncement myself]
that the strains of wizardship have been too much for you and you are taking an indefinite leave of absence! Did you hear what I said?!
[Hamilton]
Yes, your goodness.
[Burr] You'd better go get your balloon ready. Guards!
He Exits.
[Morrible]
 Glinda, dear, I know we've had our miniscule differentiations in the past...
[Burr] Guards! Madame, have you ever considered how you'd fare in captivity?
[Morrible]
 What?
[Burr] Articulated. Captivity... prison! Personally, I don't think you'll hold up very well.
My professional opinion is that you do not have what it takes. I hope you prove me wrong.
I doubt you will. Take her away!
[Morrible]
 No!!!!

[Ozia]

GOOD NEWS! SHE'S DEAD!
THE WITCH OF THE WEST IS DEAD!
THE WICKEDEST WITCH THERE EVER WAS
THE ENEMY OF ALL OF US, HERE IN [Oz,
IS DEAD!
GOOD NEWS
GOOD NEWS!!!
The Scarecrow (Fiyero) Walks On Stage. He Bends Down & Knocks On A Trap Door In The Floor.
[BURR]
 It worked!
He Opens The Door & Elphaba Climbs Out.
[HAMILTON] Fiyero! I thought you'd never get here.
She Touches His Straw Face.
[BURR]
 Go ahead, touch, I don't mind. Ah, you did the best you could. You saved my life.
[HAMILTON] You're still beautiful.
[BURR]
 You don't have to lie to me.
[HAMILTON] It's not lying... its looking at things another way.
[Ozia]

NO ONE MOURNS THE WICKED
NOW AT LAST SHE'S DEAD AND GONE!
NOW AT LAST THERE'S JOY THROUGHOUT THE LAND!
[Burr] Fellow [Ozians, friends, we have been through a frightening time. There will be other times
and other things that frighten us. But if you let me, I'd like to try to help. I'd like to try to be... Glinda the Good.
[Ozia]

GOOD NEWS!!
[BURR]
 It's time to go.
[HAMILTON] We can never come back to [Oz, can we?
[BURR]
 No.
[HAMILTON] I only wish...
[BURR]
 What?
[HAMILTON] Glinda could know that we're alive.
[BURR]
 She can't know, not if we want to be safe. No one can ever know.
[Ozia]

GOOD NEWS...
[BURR]
 Come...
[Burr]
WHO CAN SAY IF I'VE BEEN CHANGED FOR THE BETTER? BUT...
Elphaba & [Burr]
BECAUSE I KNEW YOU...
[Ozia]

NO ONE MOURNS THE WICKED...
[Burr]
BECAUSE I KNEW YOU...
Elphaba & [Burr]
I HAVE BEEN CHANGED...
Fiyero and Elphaba Leave Through The Clock
[Ozia]

NO ONE MOURNS THE WICKED!
WICKED...
WICKED!!!

Aaron Burr, Sir

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[COMPANY]
1776. New York City

[HAMILTON]
Pardon me. Are you Aaron Burr, sir?

[BURR]
That depends. Who's asking?

[HAMILTON]
Oh, well, sure, sir
I'm Alexander Hamilton, I'm at your service, sir
I have been looking for you

[BURR]
I'm getting nervous

[HAMILTON]
Sir...
I heard your name at Princeton. I was seeking an accelerated course of study when I got sort of out of sorts with a buddy of yours. I may have punched him. It's a blur, sir. He handles the financials?

[BURR]
You punched the bursar

[HAMILTON]
Yes!
I wanted to do what you did. Graduate in two, then join the revolution. He looked at me like I was stupid, I'm not stupid

So how'd you do it? How'd you graduate so fast?

[BURR]
It was my parents' dying wish before they passed

[HAMILTON]
You're an orphan. Of course! I'm an orphan
God, I wish there was a war!
Then we could prove that we're worth more
Than anyone bargained for...

[BURR]
Can I buy you a drink?

[HAMILTON]
That would be nice

[BURR]
While we're talking, let me offer you some free advice
Talk less

[HAMILTON]
What?

[BURR]
Smile more

[HAMILTON]
Ha

[BURR]
Don't let them know what you're against or what you're for

[HAMILTON]
You can't be serious

[BURR]
You wanna get ahead?

[HAMILTON]
Yes

[BURR]
Fools who run their mouths off wind up dead

[LAURE]

Yo yo yo yo yo!
What time is it?

[LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
Show time!

[BURR]
...like I said...

[LAURE]

Show time! Show time! Yo!
I'm John Laurens in the place to be!
Two pints o' Sam Adams, but I'm workin' on three, uh!
Those redcoats don't want it with me!
Cuz I will pop chick-a pop these cops till I'm free!

[LAFAYETTE]
Oui oui, mon ami, je m'appelle Lafayette!
The Lancelot of the revolutionary set!
I came from afar just to say "Bonsoir!"
Tell the King "Casse toi!" Who's the best?
C'est moi!

[MULLIGAN]
Brrrah brraaah! I am Hercules Mulligan
Up in it, lovin' it, yes I heard ya mother said "Come again?"
Lock up ya daughters and horses, of course
It's hard to have intercourse over four sets of corsets...

[LAURE]

No more sex, pour me another brew, son!
Let's raise a couple more...

[LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
To the revolution!

[LAURE]

Well, if it ain't the prodigy of Princeton college!

[MULLIGAN]
Aaron Burr!

[LAURE]

Give us a verse, drop some knowledge!

[BURR]
Good luck with that] you're takin' a stand
You spit. I'm ‘a sit. We'll see where we land

[LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
Boooo!

[LAURE]

Burr, the revolution's imminent. What do you stall for?

[HAMILTON]
If you stand for nothing, Burr, what'll you fall for?
[LAURE]

Ooh
Who are you? [MULLIGAN]
Ooh

Who are you? [LAFAYETTE]
Ooh

Who are you?

Ooh, who is this kid? What's he gonna do?

My Shot

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[HAMILTON]
I am not throwing away my shot!
I am not throwing away my shot!
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot!
I'm ‘a get a scholarship to King's College
I prob'ly shouldn't brag, but dag, I amaze and astonish
The problem is I got a lot of brains but no polish
I gotta holler just to be heard
With every word, I drop knowledge!
I'm a diamond in the rough, a shiny piece of coal
Tryin' to reach my goal. My power of speech] unimpeachable
Only nineteen but my mind is older
These New York City streets get colder, I shoulder
Ev'ry burden, ev'ry disadvantage
I have learned to manage, I don't have a gun to brandish
I walk these streets famished
The plan is to fan this spark into a flame
But damn, it's getting dark, so let me spell out the name
I am the-

[HAMILTON/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN/LAURE]

A-L-E-X-A-N-D
E-R-we are-meant to be...

[HAMILTON]
A colony that runs independently
Meanwhile, Britain keeps shittin' on us endlessly
Essentially, they tax us relentlessly
Then King George turns around, runs a spending spree
He ain't ever gonna set his descendants free
So there will be a revolution in this century
Enter me!

[LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN/LAURE]

(He says in parentheses)

[HAMILTON]
Don't be shocked when your hist'ry book mentions me
I will lay down my life if it sets us free
Eventually, you'll see my ascendancy
[HAMILTON]
And I am not throwing away
My shot
I am not throwing away
My shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot
[LAURE]

My shot!

My shot!

And I'm not throwing away my shot.

[HAMILTON/MULLIGAN/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE]
I am not throwing away my shot
I am not throwing away my shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot
It's time to take a shot!

[LAFAYETTE]
I dream of life without a monarchy
The unrest in France will lead to ‘onarchy?
‘Onarchy? How you say, how you say, ‘anarchy?'
When I fight, I make the other side panicky
With my-

[HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
Shot!

[MULLIGAN]
Yo, I'm a tailor's apprentice
And I got y'all knuckleheads in loco parentis
I'm joining the rebellion cuz I know it's my chance
To socially advance, instead of sewin' some pants!
I'm gonna take a-

[HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
Shot!

[LAURE]

But we'll never be truly free
Until those in bondage have the same rights as you and me
You and I. Do or die. Wait till I sally in
On a stallion with the first black battalion
Have another-

[HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
Shot!

[BURR]
Geniuses, lower your voices
You keep out of trouble and you double your choices
I'm with you, but the situation is fraught
You've got to be carefully taught]
If you talk, you're gonna get shot!

[HAMILTON]
Burr, check what we got
Mister Lafayette, hard rock like Lancelot
I think your pants look hot
Laurens, I like you a lot
Let's hatch a plot blacker than the kettle callin' the pot...
What are the odds the gods would put us all in one spot
Poppin' a squat on conventional wisdom, like it or not
A bunch of revolutionary manumission abolitionists?
Give me a position, show me where the ammunition is!

Oh, am I talkin' too loud?
Sometimes I get over excited, shoot off at the mouth
I never had a group of friends before
I promise that I'll make y'all proud

[LAURE]

Let's get this guy in front of a crowd

[HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN/ENSEMBLE]
I am not throwing away my shot
I am not throwing away my shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot

I am not throwing away my shot
I am not throwing away my shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot
[LAURE]

Ev'rybody sing]
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Hey!
Whoa!
Wooh!!
Whoa!
Ay, let ‘em hear ya!

Let's go!

I said shout it to the rooftops!
Said, to the rooftops!
Come on!

Come on, let's go! [HAMILTON/LAFAYETTE/
MULLIGAN]
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

Whoa!

Whoa!

Yea!

[COMPANY]
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!

Yea!

[LAURE]

Rise up!
When you're living on your knees, you rise up
Tell your brother that he's gotta rise up
Tell your sister that she's gotta rise up
[LAURENS AND ENSEMBLE]
When are these colonies gonna rise up?
When are these colonies gonna rise up?
When are these colonies gonna rise up?
When are these colonies gonna rise up?

Rise up!
[COMPANY]
Whoa! Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!

Rise up!

[HAMILTON]
I imagine death so much it feels more like a memory
When's it gonna get me?
In my sleep? Seven feet ahead of me?
If I see it comin', do I run or do I let it be?
Is it like a beat without a melody?
See, I never thought I'd live past twenty
Where I come from some get half as many
Ask anybody why we livin' fast and we laugh, reach for a flask
We have to make this moment last, that's plenty

Scratch that
This is not a moment, it's the movement
Where all the hungriest brothers with
Something to prove went?
Foes oppose us, we take an honest stand
We roll like Moses, claimin' our promised land
And? If we win our independence?
‘Zat a guarantee of freedom for our descendants?
Or will the blood we shed begin an endless
Cycle of vengeance and death with no defendants?
I know the action in the street is excitin'
But Jesus, between all the bleedin' ‘n fightin'
I've been readin' ‘n writin'
We need to handle our financial situation
Are we a nation of states? What's the state of our nation?
I'm past patiently waitin'. I'm passionately
Smashin' every expectation
Every action's an act of creation!
I'm laughin' in the face of casualties and sorrow
For the first time, I'm thinkin' past tomorrow

[HAMILTON AND COMPANY]
And I am not throwing away my shot
I am not throwing away my shot

Farmer Refuted

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[SEABURY]
Hear ye, hear ye! My name is Samuel Seabury
And I present "Free Thoughts on the
Proceedings of the Continental Congress!"
Heed not the rabble who scream revolution
They have not your interests at heart

[MULLIGAN]
Oh my God. Tear this dude apart

[SEABURY]
Chaos and bloodshed are not a solution
Don't let them lead you astray
This Congress does not speak for me

[BURR]
Let him be

[SEABURY]
They're playing a dangerous game
I pray the king shows you his mercy
For shame, for shame...
[HAMILTON]
Yo!
He'd have you all unravel at the
Sound of screams but the
Revolution is comin'
The have-nots are gonna
Win this
It's hard to listen to you with a straight face

Chaos and bloodshed already haunt us, honestly you shouldn't even talk. And what about Boston? Look at the cost, n' all that we've lost n' you talk
About Congress?!

My dog speaks more eloquently than thee!

But strangely, your mange is the same

Is he in Jersey?

For the revolution!
[SEABURY]
Heed not the rabble
Who scream
Revolution, they
Have not your
Interests
At heart

Chaos and bloodshed are
Not a
Solution. Don't
Let them lead you
Astray
This Congress does not
Speak for me

They're playing a dangerous game

I pray the king shows you his mercy

For shame

For shame,

[COMPANY]
For the revolution!

[SEABURY]
Heed-

[HAMILTON]
If you repeat yourself again I'm gonna-

[SEABURY/HAMILTON]
Scream-

[HAMILTON]
Honestly, look at me, please don't read!

[SEABURY]
Not your interests-

[HAMILTON]
Don't modulate the key then not debate with me!
Why should a tiny island across the sea regulate the price of tea?

[BURR]
Alexander, please!

[HAMILTON]
Burr, I'd rather be divisive than indecisive, drop the niceties

Silence! A message from the King!

You'll Be Back

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[KING GEORGE]
You say
The price of my love's not a price that you're willing to pay
You cry
In your tea which you hurl in the sea when you see me go by
Why so sad?
Remember we made an arrangement when you went away
Now you're making me mad
Remember, despite our estrangement, I'm your man
You'll be back
Soon you'll see
You'll remember you belong to me
You'll be back
Time will tell
You'll remember that I served you well
Oceans rise
Empires fall
We have seen each other through it all
And when push
Comes to shove
I will send a fully armed battalion
To remind you of my love!

Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da
Da da dat dat da ya da!
Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da
Da da dat dat da...

You say our love is draining and you can't go on
You'll be the one complaining when I am gone...
And no, don't change the subject
Cuz you're my favorite subject
My sweet, submissive subject
My loyal, royal subject
Forever and ever and ever and ever and ever...

You'll be back
Like before
I will fight the fight and win the war
For your love
For your praise
And I'll love you till my dying days
When you're gone
I'll go mad
So don't throw away this thing we had

Cuz when push comes to shove
I will kill your friends and family to remind you of my love
Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da
Da da dat dat da ya da!
Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da
Da da dat-
Everybody!

[ENSEMBLE]
Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da

[HAMILTON/BURR/MULLIGAN/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE]

[HAMILTON]
If they tell my story
I am either gonna die on the battlefield in glory or-

We will fight for this land
But there's only one man
Who can give us a command so we can-

We gotta make an all out stand
Ayo, I'm gonna need a right-hand man.

What?

Buck, buck, buck, buck, buck!

Buck, buck, buck, buck, buck!

[WASHINGTON]
Check it-
Can I be real a second?
For just a millisecond?
Let down my guard and tell the people how I feel a second?
Now I'm the model of a modern major general
The venerated Virginian veteran whose men are all
Lining up, to put me up on a pedestal
Writin' letters to relatives
Embellishin' my elegance and eloquence
But the elephant is in the room
The truth is in ya face when ya hear the British cannons go...

[ENSEMBLE]
Boom!

[WASHINGTON]
Any hope of success is fleeting
How can I keep leading when the people I'm
Leading keep retreating?
We put a stop to the bleeding as the British take Brooklyn
Knight takes rook, but look
[WASHINGTON]
We are outgunned

Outmanned

Outnumbered
Outplanned

We gotta make an all out stand
Ayo, I'm gonna need a right-hand man

Incoming!

[MULLIGAN]

Let's take a stand with the stamina God has granted us
Hamilton won't abandon ship
Yo, let's steal their cannons-
[MULLIGAN]
Shh-boom! [COMPANY]

Goes the cannon, watch the blood and the shit spray and...

[COMPANY]

Goes the cannon, we're abandonin' Kips Bay and...

There's another ship and...

[COMPANY]
Boom!

[WASHINGTON]
We just lost the southern tip and...

[COMPANY]
Boom!

[WASHINGTON]
We gotta run to Harlem quick, we can't afford another slip
Guns and horses giddyup
I decide to divvy up
My forces, they're skittish as the British cut the city up
This close to giving up, facing mad scrutiny
I scream in the face of this mass mutiny]
Are these the men with which I am to defend America?
We ride at midnight, Manhattan in the distance
I cannot be everywhere at once, people
I'm in dire need of assistance...

[BURR]
Your excellency, sir!

[WASHINGTON]
Who are you?

[BURR]
Aaron Burr, Sir?
Permission to state my case?

[WASHINGTON]
As you were

[BURR]
Sir
I was a captain under General Montgomery
Until he caught a bullet in the neck in Quebec
And well, in summary
I think that I could be of some assistance
I admire how you keep firing on the British
From a distance

[WASHINGTON]
Huh

[BURR]
I have some questions, a couple of suggestions on how to fight instead of fleeing west

[WASHINGTON]
Yes?

[BURR]
Well-

[HAMILTON]
Your excellency, you wanted to see me?

[WASHINGTON]
Hamilton, come in, have you met Burr?

[HAMILTON]
Yes, sir

[HAMILTON AND BURR]
We keep meeting

[BURR]
As I was saying, sir, I look forward to seeing your strategy play out

[WASHINGTON]
Burr?

[BURR]
Sir?

[WASHINGTON]
Close the door on your way out

[HAMILTON]
Have I done something wrong, sir?

[WASHINGTON]
On the contrary
I called you here because our odds are beyond scary
Your reputation precedes you, but I have to laugh

[HAMILTON]
Sir?

[WASHINGTON]
Hamilton, how come no one can get you on their staff?

[HAMILTON]
Sir!

[WASHINGTON]
Don't get me wrong, you're a young man, of great renown
I know you stole British cannons when we were still downtown
Nathaniel Green and Henry Knox wanted to hire you...

[HAMILTON]
To be their Secretary? I don't think so

[WASHINGTON]
Why're you upset?

[HAMILTON]
I'm not-

[WASHINGTON]
It's alright, you want to fight, you've got a hunger
I was just like you when I was younger
Head full of fantasies of dyin' like a martyr?

[HAMILTON]
Yes

[WASHINGTON]
Dying is easy, young man. Living is harder

[HAMILTON]
Why are you telling me this?

[WASHINGTON]
I'm being honest
I'm working with a third of what our Congress has promised
We are a powder keg about to explode
I need someone like you to lighten the load. So?

[COMPANY (EXCEPT HAMILTON)]
I am not throwin' away my shot!
I am not throwin' away my shot!
Ayo, I'm just like my country, I'm young
Scrappy and hungry!

[HAMILTON]
I am not throwing away my shot!

[WASHINGTON]
Son

[WASHINGON AND COMPANY]
We are outgunned, outmanned!

[HAMILTON]
You need all the help you can get
I have some friends. Laurens, Mulligan
Marquis de Lafayette, okay, what else?

[WASHINGTON AND COMPANY]
Outnumbered, outplanned!

[HAMILTON]
We'll need some spies on the inside
Some King's men who might let some things slide
[HAMILTON]
I'll write to Congress and tell ‘em we need supplies, you rally the guys, master the element of surprise

I'll rise above my station, organize your information, ‘til we rise to the occasion of our new nation. Sir!

A Winter's Ball

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[BURR]
How does the bastard, orphan, son of a whore
Go on and on
Grow into more of a phenomenon?
Watch this obnoxious, arrogant, loudmouth bother
Be seated at the right hand of the father
Washington hires Hamilton right on sight
But Hamilton still wants to fight, not write
Now Hamilton's skill with a quill is undeniable
But what do we have in common? We're
Reliable with the

[ELIZA AND WOMEN]
Helpless!
Look into your eyes, and the sky's the limit I'm helpless!
Down for the count, and I'm drownin' in ‘em

[ELIZA]
I have never been the type to try and grab the spotlight
We were at a revel with some rebels on a hot night
Laughin' at my sister as she's dazzling the room
Then you walked in and my heart went "Boom!"
Tryin' to catch your eye from the side of the ballroom
Everybody's dancin' and the band's top volume

[ELIZA AND WOMEN]
Grind to the rhythm as we wine and dine
[ELIZA]
Grab my sister, and
Whisper, "Yo, this
One's mine."

My sister made her way across the room to you
And I got nervous, thinking "What's she gonna do?"
She grabbed you by the arm, I'm thinkin' "I'm through"
Then you look back at me and suddenly I'm
Helpless!

Oh, look at those eyes

Oh!
Yeah, I'm
Helpless, I know

I'm so into you
I am so into you

I know I'm down for the count
And I'm drownin' in ‘em.

[ELIZA]
Elizabeth Schuyler. It's a pleasure to meet you

[HAMILTON]
Schuyler?

[ANGELICA]
My sister

[ELIZA]
Thank you for all your service

[HAMILTON]
If it takes fighting a war for us to meet, it will have been worth it

[ANGELICA]
I'll leave you to it

[ELIZA AND WOMEN]
One week later

[ELIZA]
I'm writin' a letter nightly
Now my life gets better, every letter that you write me
Laughin' at my sister, cuz she wants to form a harem

[ANGELICA]
I'm just sayin', if you really loved me, you would share him
[ELIZA]
Ha!
Two weeks later
In the living room stressin'
My father's stone-faced
While you're asking for his blessin'
I'm dying inside, as
You wine
And dine
And I'm tryin' not to cry
‘cause there's nothing that your mind can't do
My father makes his way across the room
To you
I panic for a second, thinking
"we're through"
But then he shakes your hand and says
"Be true"
And you turn back to me, smiling, and I'm
Helpless!

Helpless!
Hoo!

That boy is mine
That boy is mine!

Helpless! Helpless!
Down for the count

Look into your eyes

Down for the count
And I'm drownin' in em

[HAMILTON]
Eliza, I don't have a dollar to my name
An acre of land, a troop to command, a dollop of fame
All I have's my honor, a tolerance for pain
A couple of college credits and my top-notch brain
Insane, your family brings out a different side of me
Peggy confides in me, Angelica tried to take a bite of me
No stress, my love for you is never in doubt
We'll get a little place in Harlem and we'll figure it out
I've been livin' without a family since I was a child
My father left, my mother died, I grew up buckwild
But I'll never forget my mother's face, that was real
And long as I'm alive, Eliza, swear to God
You'll never feel so...

[HAMILTON]
Eliza...

I've never felt so-

My life is gon' be fine cuz Eliza's in it.
[ELIZA]
I do I do I do I do!

I do I do I do I do!

Hey, yeah, yeah!

I'm down for the count
I'm-

I look into your eyes, and the sky's the limit
I'm

I remember that night, I just might
Regret that night for the rest of my days

I remember those soldier boys
Tripping over themselves to win our praise

I remember that dreamlike candlelight
Like a dream that you can't quite place

But Alexander, I'll never forget the first
Time I saw your face

I have never been the same
Intelligent eyes in a hunger-pang frame
And when you said "Hi," I forgot my dang name
Set my heart aflame, ev'ry part aflame

[FULL COMPANY]
This is not a game...

You strike me as a woman who has never been satisfied

I have never been satisfied

[ANGELICA]
My name is Angelica Schuyler

[HAMILTON]
Alexander Hamilton

[ANGELICA]
Where's your fam'ly from?

[HAMILTON]
Unimportant. There's a million things I haven't done but
Just you wait, just you wait...

[ANGELICA]
So so so-
So this is what it feels like to match wits
With someone at your level! What the hell is the catch? It's
The feeling of freedom, of seein' the light
It's Ben Franklin with a key and a kite! You see it, right?
The conversation lasted two minutes, maybe three minutes
Ev'rything we said in total agreement, it's
A dream and it's a bit of a dance
A bit of a posture, it's a bit of a stance. He's a
Bit of a flirt, but I'm ‘a give it a chance
I asked about his fam'ly, did you see his answer?
His hands started fidgeting, he looked askance?
He's penniless, he's flying by the seat of his pants

Handsome, boy, does he know it!
Peach fuzz, and he can't even grow it!
I wanna take him far away from this place
Then I turn and see my sister's face and she is...

[ELIZA]
Helpless...

[ANGELICA]
And I know she is...

[ELIZA]
Helpless...

[ANGELICA]
And her eyes are just...

[ELIZA]
Helpless...

[ANGELICA]
And I realize

[ANGELICA AND COMPANY]
Three fundamental truths at the exact same time...

[HAMILTON]
Where are you taking me?

[ANGELICA]
I'm about to change your life

[HAMILTON]
Then by all means, lead the way

[COMPANY (EXCEPT ANGELICA)]
Number one!

[ANGELICA]
I'm a girl in a world in which
My only job is to marry rich
My father has no sons so I'm the one
Who has to social climb for one
So I'm the oldest and the wittiest and the gossip in
New York City is insidious
Alexander is penniless
Ha! That doesn't mean I want him any less

[ELIZA]
Elizabeth Schuyler. It's a pleasure to meet you

[HAMILTON]
Schuyler?

[ANGELICA]
My sister

[COMPANY]
Number two!

[ANGELICA]
He's after me cuz I'm a Schuyler sister
That elevates his status, I'd
Have to be naïve to set that aside
Maybe that is why I introduce him to Eliza
Now that's his bride
Nice going, Angelica, he was right
You will never be satisfied

[ELIZA]
Thank you for all your service

[HAMILTON]
If it takes fighting a war for us to meet, it will have been worth it

[ANGELICA]
I'll leave you to it

[COMPANY]
Number three!

[ANGELICA]
I know my sister like I know my own mind
You will never find anyone as trusting or as kind
If I tell her that I love him she'd be silently resigned
He'd be mine
She would say, "I'm fine"

[ANGELICA AND COMPANY]
She'd be lying

[ANGELICA]
But when I fantasize at night
It's Alexander's eyes
As I romanticize what might
Have been if I hadn't sized him
Up so quickly
At least my dear Eliza's his wife;
At least I keep his eyes in my life...
[ANGELICA]
To the groom!

To the bride!

From your sister

Who is always by your side

To your union

And the hope that you provide

May you always

Be satisfied

And I know

She'll be happy as

His bride
And I know [ALL MEN (EXCEPT HAMILTON)]
To the groom!
To the groom!
To the groom!

To the bride!
To the bride!

Angelica!
Angelica!

By your side

To the union!
To the revolution!

You provide!
You provide!

[HAMILTON AND MEN]
Always-

Be satisfied

Be satisfied

[MEN]
Be satisfied
Be satisfied
Be satisfied
Be satisfied

Be satisfied
Be satisfied

Be satisfied
Be satisfied
Be satisfied
Be satisfied.

[ALL WOMEN (EXCEPT ELIZA)]
To the groom!

To the bride!

To the bride!

[ELIZA AND WOMEN]
Angelica!

By your side

To the union!
To the revolution!

You provide!

Always-

Be satisfied

[WOMEN]
Be satisfied

Be satisfied

Be satisfied.

[ANGELICA]
He will never be satisfied
I will never be satisfied

The Story of Tonight (Reprise)

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[LAURE]

I may not live to see our glory!

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE]
I may not live to see our glory!

[LAURE]

But I've seen wonders great and small

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE]
I've seen wonders great and small

[LAURE]

‘Cause if the tomcat can get married

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE]
If Alexander can get married-

[LAURE]

There's hope for our ass, after all!

[LAFAYETTE]
Raise a glass to freedom

[LAURENS/MULLIGAN]
Hey!
Something you will never see again!

[MULLIGAN]
No matter what she tells you

[LAFAYETTE]
Let's have another round tonight!

[LAURE]

Raise a glass to the four of us!

[LAFAYETTE/HAMILTON]
Ho!

[MULLIGAN]
To the newly not poor of us!

[LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/HAMILTON]
Woo!

[LAFAYETTE]
We'll tell the story of tonight

[LAURE]

Let's have another round-

[HAMILTON]
Well, if it isn't Aaron Burr

[BURR]
Sir!

[HAMILTON]
I didn't think that you would make it

[BURR]
To be sure

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE]
Burr!

[BURR]
I came to say congratulations

[MULLIGAN]
Spit a verse, Burr!

[BURR]
I see the whole gang is here

[LAFAYETTE]
You are the worst, Burr!

[HAMILTON]
Ignore them. Congrats to you, Lieutenant Colonel
I wish I had your command instead of manning George's journal

[BURR]
No, you don't

[HAMILTON]
Yes, I do

[BURR]
Now, be sensible
From what I hear, you've made yourself indispensable

[LAURE]

Well, well, I heard
You've got a special someone on the side, Burr

[HAMILTON]
Is that so?

[LAURE]

What are you tryin' to hide, Burr?

[BURR]
I should go

[HAMILTON]
No, these guys should go

[LAFAYETTE]
What?

[LAURE]

No!

[HAMILTON]
Leave us alone

[MULLIGAN]
Man...

[HAMILTON]
It's alright, Burr. I wish you'd brought this girl with you tonight, Burr

[BURR]
You're very kind, but I'm afraid it's unlawful, sir

[HAMILTON]
What do you mean?

[BURR]
She's married

[HAMILTON]
I see

[BURR]
She's married to a British officer

[HAMILTON]
Oh shit...

[BURR]
Congrats again, Alexander. Smile more
I'll see you on the other side of the war

[HAMILTON]
I will never understand you
If you love this woman, go get her! What are you waiting for?

[BURR]
I'll see you on the other side of the war

[HAMILTON]
I'll see you on the other side of the war

Wait For It

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[BURR]
Theodosia writes me a letter everyday
I'm keeping the bed warm while her husband is away
He's on the British side in Georgia
He's trying to keep the colonies in line
But he can keep all of Georgia
Theodosia, she's mine

Love doesn't discriminate
Between the sinners
And the saints
It takes and it takes and it takes
And we keep loving anyway
We laugh and we cry
And we break
And we make our mistakes
And if there's a reason I'm by her side
When so many have tried
Then I'm willing to wait for it
I'm willing to wait for it
[BURR]
My grandfather was a fire and brimstone preacher

But there are things that the
Homilies and hymns won't teach ya

My mother was a genius

My father commanded respect

When they died they left no instructions
Just a legacy to protect

[MEN]
Preacher, preacher
Preacher

Teach ya, teach ya, teach ya

Respect, respect

[WOMEN]
Genius


[LAURE]

GOOD NEWS, SHE'S DEAD!
THE WITCH OF THE WEST IS DEAD!
THE WICKEDEST WITCH THERE EVER WAS,
THE ENEMY OF ALL OF US HERE IN [,
IS DEAD! GOOD NEWS! GOOD NEWS!

[LAURE]

Look, it's Glinda!


[LAURE]

floats in on a giant bubble

[LAURE]

 It's good to see me, isn't it? ([Ozians Agree) No need to respond that was rhetorical. Fellow [Ozia]


[BURR]
LET US BE GLAD,
LET US BE GRATEFUL,
LET US REJOICIFY THAT GOODNESS COULD SUBDUE
THE WICKED WORKINGS OF YOU KNOW WHO!
ISN'T IT NICE TO KNOW
THAT GOOD WILL CONQUER EVIL?
THE TRUTH WE ALL BELIEVE'LL BY AND BY
OUTLIVE A LIE
FOR YOU AND...

[BURR]
Glinda! Exactly how dead is she?

[[Burr] Well, there has been much rumor and speculation... innuendo, outuendo...
but let me set the record straight. According to the Time Dragon Clock, the melting occurred at the 13th hour;
a direct result of a bucket of water thrown by a female child. Yes, the Wicked Witch of the West is dead!

[Ozian]
NO ONE MOURNS THE WICKED!

[Ozian]
NO ONE CRIES THEY WON'T RETURN!

[Ozia]

NO ONE LAYS A LILY ON THEIR GRAVE!
[Ozian Man]
THE GOOD MAN SCORNS THE WICKED!
Women]
THROUGH THEIR LIVES OUR CHILDREN LEARN!

[Ozia]

WHAT WE MISS WHEN WE MISBEHAVE!
[Burr]
AND GOODNESS KNOWS
THE WICKEDS' LIVES ARE LONELY
GOODNESS KNOWS
THE WICKED DIE ALONE
IT JUST SHOWS WHEN YOU'RE WICKED
YOU'RE LEFT ONLY
ON YOUR OWN
[Ozia]

YES, GOODNESS KNOWS
THE WICKEDS' LIVES ARE LONELY
GOODNESS KNOWS
THE WICKED CRY ALONE
NOTHING GROWS FOR THE WICKED
THEY REAP ONLY
WHAT THEY'VE SEWN
[Ozian] Glinda, why does wickedness happen?
[Burr] That's a good question; one that many people find confusifying. Are people born wicked,
or do they have wickedness thrust upon them? After all, she had a childhood,;
She had a father, who just happed to be the governor of munchlinkland Witch's Parents Enter.

[Frex]
 I'm off to the assembly, dear.
[Burr] She had a mother, as so many do...
[Frex]

HOW I HATE TO GO AND LEAVE YOU LONELY
Melena]
THAT'S ALRIGH IT'S ONLY JUST ONE NIGHT
[Frex]

BUT KNOW THAT YOU'RE HERE, IN MY HEART
WHILE I'M OUT OF YOUR SIGHT!
Frex Exits. A Lover Runs Into The Room.
[Burr] And like all families, they had their secrets.
Lover]
HAVE ANOTHER DRINK, MY DARK EYED BEAUTY,
I'VE GOT ONE MORE NIGHT LEFT HERE IN TOWN,
SO HAVE ANOTHER DRINK OF GREEN ELIXER
AND WE'LL HAVE OURSELVES A LITTLE MIXER
HAVE ANOTHER LITTLE SWALLOW LITTLE LADY,
AND FOLLOW ME DOWN
[Burr] And of course, from the moment she was born she was... well... different!
Midwife] AHHH!! It's coming!
[Frex]
 Now?
Midwife] The baby's coming!
[Frex]
 And how!

Midwife]
I SEE A NOSE!
[Frex]

I SEE A CURL!
Both]
IT'S A HEALTHY, PERFECT, LOVELY LITTLE...
(They Scream)
Melena] What is it? What's wrong?
Midwife]
HOW CAN IT BE?
[Frex]

WHAT DOES IT MEAN?
Midwife]
IT'S ATTROCIOUS!
[Frex]

IT'S OBSCENE!
Both]
LIKE A FROGGY, FERNY CABBAGE,
THE BABY IS UNATURALLY
GREEN!!!
[Frex]
 Take it away... Take it away!!!!
[Burr] So you see, it couldn't have been easy!

Munchki]

NO ONE MOURNS THE WICKED!
NOW AT LAST, SHE'S DEAD AND GONE!
NOW AT LAST THERE'S JOY THROUGHOUT THE LAND!
AND GOODNESS KNOWS (GOODNESS KNOWS)
WE KNOW WHAT GOODNESS IS (OOOOHHHH)
GOODNESS KNOWS, THE WICKED DIE ALONE (SHE DIED ALONE)
WOE TO THOSE (WOE TO THOSE)
WHO SPURN WHAT GOODNESSES THEY ARE SHOWN!
NO ONE MOURNS THE WICKED (GOOD NEWS)
NO ONE MOURNS THE WICKED (GOOD NEWS)
NO ONE MOURNS... THE WICKED...
WICKED...
WICKED!!!!!
[Burr] Well, this has been fun! But as you can imagine I have much to attend to,
what with the Wizard's unexpected departure. So, if there are no further questions...
[Ozian] Glinda, is it true you were her friend?
[Ozians Gasp
[Burr] Well, I... you see... um... yes.
Louder Gasps
[Burr] Well, it depends on what you mean by "friend". She Motions Her Bubble Downward.
I did know her. That is, our paths did cross... at school. But you must understand, it was a long time ago and we were both very young.

[Students]

O, HALLOWED HALLS AND VINE DRAPED WALLS
THE PROUDLIEST SITE THERE IS.
WHEN GREY AND SEER OUR HAIR HATH TURNED,
WE SHALL STILL REVERE THE LESSONS LEARNED
IN OUR DAYS AT DEAR OLD SHIZ (DEAR OLD SHIZ)
OUR DAYS AT DEAR OLD...
[linda]

 Being Wheeled In On A Big Cart Filled With Luggage.
OOOOOOOOOOLD
All]
SHIZZZZZZZZZZZ (DEAR OLD SHIZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ)
Frex Wheels Nessarose On Stage.
[HAMILTON]
 What?! What are you looking at? Oh, do I have something in my teeth?
Okay, let's get this over with. No, I'm not seasick, yes, I've always been green, no, I didn't chew grass as a child.
[Frex]
 Elphaba!
[HAMILTON] Oh, this is my younger sister, Nessarose. As you can see, she is a perfectly normal color.
[Frex]
 Elphaba, stop making a spectacle of yourself! I'm only sending you here for one reason...
[HAMILTON] Yes, I know, to look after Nessarose.
Frex Holds Out A Box.
[Frex]
 My precious little girl] a parting gift.
[Angelica]
 Now, father... He Pulls Silver Shoes From The Box. Jeweled shoes!
[Frex]
 As befits the future governor of Munchkinland. Elphaba, take care of your sister.
And try not to talk so much! He Kisses Nessarose And Exits.
[Angelica]
 Elphaba...
[HAMILTON] Well what could he have gotten me? I clash with everything!
Mme. Morrible Enters
[Morrible]
 Welcome, new students! I am Madame Morrible, headmistress here, at Shiz University.
And whether you're here to study logic, literature, or linguification,
I know I speak for my fellow faculty members when I say we have nothing but the highest hopes for some of you.
Now, regarding room assignments... Elphaba & Galinda Raise Their Hands.
She Notices Galinda First. Yes, is this regarding room assignments?
[linda]

 Oh, Madame, thank you for asking, but I've already been assigned a private suite...
Noticing Her Followers' Disappointment. But you can all come visit me whenever you want!
Shen Shen] How good of you!
Pfanee] You are so good!
[linda]

 No I'm not!
Both] Yes you are!
[linda]

 Now stop! Swishes Her Hair.
[Morrible]
 Do you have a question?

[linda]

 Yes, you see, I am Galinda Upland of the Upperuplands... I've applied to your sorcery seminar,
and indeed that is my sole purpose of attending Shiz; to study sorcery with you.
Perhaps you recall my essay, "Magic Wands, Need They Have A Point".
[Morrible]
 Yes... However, I do not teach my seminar every semester, unless, of course, somebody special were to come along.
[linda]

 Well, exactly!
[HAMILTON] We have not yet received our room assignments.
[Morrible]
 Yes, yes, of course! Oh, You must be Miss Nessarose, the governor's daughter.
What a tragically beautiful face you have! Sees Elphaba, snorts...And you must be.
[HAMILTON] I'm the other daughter. Elphaba. I'm beautifully tragic.
[Morrible]
 Yes, yes, I'm sure you're very bright.
[linda]

 Bright? She's phosphorescent.
[Morrible]
 I don't seem to have you on my list. Oh, well a slight gulch, but not to fret! We'll find someplace to put you.
[linda]

 Y'know, I don't even think she read my essay.
Shen Shen] That's so unfair!
[Angelica]
 You should say something!
[linda]

 Should I?
Pfanee] Do it!
[Morrible]
 Now, which one of you young ladies would like to volunteer to share with Miss Elphaba?
[linda]

 Madame Morrible...
[Morrible]
 Thank you dear. Oh, how very good of you!
[linda]

 What?
[Morrible]
 Miss Elphaba, you may share with Miss Galinda.
[linda]

 Huh?
[Morrible]
 The governor made his concern for your sister's well being quite clear.
So, I thought it would be best if she share my private compartment where I can assist her as needed...
[HAMILTON] But Madame, I've always looked after my sister.
[Morrible]
 Everyone, to your dormitories.
[HAMILTON] But Madame...
[HAMILTON] Let her go!!!
Nessarose's Wheelchair Is Torn From Morrible's Hands And Begins To Wheel Itself Back To Elphaba.
[Morrible]
 How did you do that?
[linda]

 How did she do that?
[Angelica]
 Elphaba!
[Morrible]
 You mean this has happened before?
[HAMILTON] Uh... Something just comes over me sometimes... I'm sorry, Madame.
[Morrible]
 What? Never apologize for talent! Talent is a gift! Have you ever considered a career in sorcery?
[HAMILTON] Sorcery?
[Morrible]
 I shall tutor you myself, and take no other students.
[linda]

 What?
All Students But Galinda Exit.
[Morrible]
 Oh, Miss Elphaba...
MANY YEARS I HAVE WAITED
FOR A GIFT LIKE YOURS TO APPEAR
WHY I PREDICT THE WIZARD COULD MAKE YOU HIS
MAGIC, GRAND VIZIER!
MY DEAR, MY DEAR,
I'LL WRITE AT ONCE TO THE WIZARD
TELL HIM OF YOU IN ADVANCE
WITH A TALENT LIKE YOURS, DEAR, THERE IS
A DEFIN-ISH CHANCE
IF YOU WORK AS YOU SHOULD
YOU'LL BE MAKING GOOD
[linda]

 Madame Morrible...
[Morrible]
 No, not now dearest. She Exits.
[Burr] This will just make me a better person. She simles.
She Runs Off.

[HAMILTON]
DID THAT REALLY JUST HAPPEN?
HAVE I ACTUALLY UNDERSTOOD?
THIS WEIRD QUIRK I'VE TRIED TO SURPRESS OR HIDE
IS A TALENT THAT COULD HELP ME MEET THE WIZARD
IF I MAKE GOOD
SO I'LL MAKE GOOD.
WHEN I MEET THE WIZARD,
ONCE I PROVE MY WORTH,
AND THEN I MEET THE WIZARD,
WHAT I'VE WAITED FOR SINCE
SINCE BIRTH!
AND WITH ALL HIS WIZARD WISDOM
BY MY LOOKS HE WON'T BE BLINDED
DO YOU THINK THE WIZARD IS DUMB?
OR LIKE MUNCHKINS SO SMALL-MINDED? NO!
HE'LL SAY TO ME "I SEE WHO YOU TRULY ARE,
A GIRL ON WHOM I CAN RELY"
AND THAT'S HOW WE'LL BEGIN,
THE WIZARD AND I
ONCE I'M WITH THE WIZARD,
MY WHOLE LIFE WILL CHANGE,
'CUZ ONCE YOU'RE WITH THE WIZARD
NO ONE THINKS YOU'RE STRANGE
NO FATHER IS NOT PROUD OF YOU,
NO SISTER ACTS ASHAMED,
AND ALL OF OzHAS TO LOVE YOU
WHEN BY THE WIZARD YOU'RE ACLAIMED
AND THIS GIFT OR THIS CURSE
THAT I HAVE INSIDE
MAYBE AT LAST I'LL KNOW WHY
WHEN WE ARE HAND IN HAND,
THE WIZARD AND I
AND ONE DAY HE'LL SAY TO ME, "ELPHABA,
A GIRL WHO IS SO SUPERIOR,
SHOULDN'T A GIRL WHO'S SO GOOD INSIDE
HAVE A MATCHING EXTERIOR?
AND SINCE FOLKS HERE TO AN OBSURED DEGREE
SEEM FIXATED ON YOUR VERDEGRIS
WOULD IT BE ALRIGHT BY YOU
IF I DEGREENIFY YOU?"
AND OF COURSE THAT'S NOT IMPORTANT TO ME
"ALRIGHT! WHY NOT?" I'LL REPLY
OH, WHAT A PAIR WE'LL BE
THE WIZARD AND I
YES, WHAT A PAIR WE'LL BE
THE WIZARD AND...
UNLIMITED, MY FUTURE IS UNLIMITED
AND I'VE JUST HAD A VISION ALMOST LIKE A PROPHECY
I KNOW
IT SOUNDS TRULY CRAZY
AND TRUE, THE VISION'S HAZY
BUT I SWEAR SOME DAY THERE'LL BE
A CELEBRATION THROUGHOUT [Oz
THAT'S ALL TO DO
WITH ME!
AND I'LL STAND THERE WITH THE WIZARD
FEELING THINGS I'VE NEVER FELT
AND THOUGH I'D NEVER SHOW IT
I'D BE SO HAPPY I COULD MELT!
AND SO IT WILL BE FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE
AND I'LL WANT NOTHING ELSE 'TILL I DIE
HELD IN SUCH HIGH ESTEEM!
WHEN PEOPLE SEE ME THEY WILL SCREAM
FOR HALF OF [Oz'S FAVORITE TEAM]
THE WIZARD...
AND I!!!!

[linda]

 Dearest, Darlingest Momsy and Popsicle...
[HAMILTON] My dear father...
Both]
THERE'S BEEN SOME CONFUSION OVER ROOMING HERE AT SHIZ
[HAMILTON]
BUT, OF COURSE, I'LL CARE FOR NESSA...

Both]
FOR I KNOW THAT'S HOW YOU'D WANT ME TO RESPOND
Yes...
THERE'S BEEN SOME CONFUSION FOR YOU SEE MY ROOMATE IS...
[linda]

MY PULSE IS RUSHING...

STILL I DO BELIEVE THAT IT CAN LAST!
AND I WILL BE LOATHING, LOATHING YOU

[Students]

DEAR GALINDA, YOU ARE JUST TOO GOOD!
HOW DO YOU STAND IT, I DON'T THINK I COULD!
SHE'S A TERROR! SHE'S A TARTAR!
WE DON'T MEAN TO SHOW A BIAS,
BUT GALINDA, YOU'RE A MARTAR!
[linda]

Both] MY WHOLE LIFE LONG!!!!
[HAMILTON] Boo!
[linda]

 Ahh!
[HAMILTON] Hahahaha!

[Hamilton]
 Settle down, now! I have read your most recent essays. And I am amazed to report the progress!
Although, some of us still tend to favor form over content... Ms. Glinda.
[linda]

 It's GAlinda.
[Hamilton]
 Excuse me... Glinda.
[linda]

 I really don't see what the problem is. Every other professor seems to be able to pronounce my name.
[HAMILTON] Maybe pronouncing your precious name isn't the sole purpose of Doctor Dillamond's life. Maybe he's not like every other professor. Maybe some of us are different.
[linda]

 Oh! It seems the artichoke is steamed.
[Hamilton]
 Class, class! Miss Elphaba has a point! As you know, I am the sole Animal on the faculty. The token Goat, as it were. But it wasn't always this way. Oh, dear students, how I wish you could have seen it as it once was. Where you could walk down the halls and see an antelope explicating a sonnet, a snow leopard solving an equation, a wildebeast waxing philosophic. Don't you see, dear students, how our dear Ozis becoming less and less...looks at Elphaba... colorful. Now, who can tell me what sent these events into motion?
[HAMILTON] Raises hand From what I've heard, it all started with the great drought.
[Hamilton]
 Exactly. Food grew scarce, people grew hungrier and angrier. And the question became "Whom can we blame?" Can anyone tell me what is meant by the term "Scapegoat"? Elphaba Raises Hand. Someone besides Miss Elphaba? Ah yes, Miss Glinda...
[linda]

 It's GAlinda... with a GA. I don't see why you can't just teach us history instead of always harping on the past.
[Hamilton]
 Well, perhaps these questions will enlighten you... Walks Over To The Chalk Board And Turns It Over. On it is written] ANIMALS SHOULD BE SEEN AND NOT HEARD. Who is responsible for this? I'm waiting for answer... Very well, that will be all for today... You heard me, class dismissed!!!
All Students Exit Except Elphaba & Nessarose. Dillamond Has His Back Turned To Her.
[HAMILTON] You go on ahead, Nessa.
Nessarose Exits.
[HAMILTON] Reading The Board Aloud. "Animals should be seen and not heard..."
[Hamilton]
 Oh, Miss Elphaba, don't worry about me, go along and enjoy your friends.
[HAMILTON] Oh that's alright, I have no friends. Would you like to share my lunch?
[Hamilton]
 Oh, thank you! How kind.
She Pulls Out A Candy Bar And Unwraps It. He Takes The Paper and Begins To Eat It. He Sees The Board.
[Hamilton]
 I seem to have lost my appetite.
[HAMILTON] You shouldn't let statements like that bother you. I mean, I always do, but you shouldn't.
[Hamilton]
if it were only a matter of words on a chalkboard. But the things one hears these days... dreadful things! Miss Elphaba...

I'VE HEARD OF AN OX, A PROFESSOR FROM QUOX
NO LONG PERMITTED TO TEACH,
WHO HAS LOST ALL POWERS OF SPEECH.
AND AN OWL IN MUNCHKIN ROCK
A VICAR WITH A THRIVING FLOCK
FORBIDDEN TO PREACH
NOW HE ONLY CAN SCREECH!
ONLY RUMORS, BUT STILL, ENOUGH TO GIVE PAUSE
TO ANYONE WITH PAWS
SOMETHING BAD IS HAPPENING IN [Oz
[HAMILTON]
SOMETHING BAD?
HAPPENING IN [Oz?
[Hamilton]

UNDER THE SURFACE
BEHIND THE SCENES
SOMETHING BAAAAAH...
Sorry, bad...
[HAMILTON] Dr. Dillamond, are you alright? Shall I fetch you a glass of water?
[Hamilton]
 No, I don't know what came over me.
[HAMILTON] So, you're saying that there are animals that have, somehow, forgotten how to speak? But, how is that possible?
[Hamilton]
 Well, with so much pressure not to...
Morrible Enters.
[Morrible]
 I heard there was some sort of disturburance in class. Are you alright, Doctor? Oh, Miss Elphaba, you're still here! I thought you would have been on your way to my seminar by now.
[HAMILTON] Yes Madame, ordinarily I would be but...
[Morrible]
 But what? I do hope I have not misplaced my trust in you. Magic is a very demanderating mistress, and if one has ambitions of meeting the Wizard. I'm sure Doctor Dillamond sees my point.
Morrible Exits.
[HAMILTON] I'd better go. Doctor Dillamond, if something bad is happening to the Animals then someone has to tell the Wizard. That's why we have a Wizard!
SO NOTHING BAD
Both]
NOTHNG ALL THAT BAD
[Hamilton]

NOTHING TRULY BAAAAHHH...
Sorry... Bad.
[HAMILTON]
IT COULDN'T HAPPEN HERE,
IN [Oz...


[BURR]
 Here we are, sir! Shiz University!
[BURR]
 What? Already?
[BURR]
 Yes, sir.
[BURR]
 What a shame. Well, we'll see you soon, Avaric. Don't worry, I won't last longer at this school than I did at any of the others.
Avaric Exits.
[Angelica]
 Uh, miss Galinda, I know I'm just a munchkin, but munchkins have feelings too, and I've been trying to tell you mine, for you. But sometimes it seems like you don't even know I'm there.
[linda]

 That's not true, Biq.
[Angelica]
 It's LAFAYETE.
[linda]

 Biq, do you know who that is? That's Fiyero Tiggular, tha Winkie Prince whose reputation is so scandalacious!
LAFAYETE Looks Disgusted. Fiyero Walks Toward Them. Galinda Swishes Her Hair. Fiyero, Noticing Her Strange Behavior, Does The Same.
[linda]

 To Fiyero. Were you looking for something or someone?
[BURR]
 Uhhh yea... history... class? I don't know... somewhere?
[Angelica]
 History building is way over there my friend...
[linda]

 That class just ended!
[BURR]
 Oh! Perfect timing! So, uh, what does one do for fun around here?
[linda]

 Nothing really... until now...
[Angelica]
 We've been studying!
[BURR]
 Well, I see that once again the responsibility to corrupt my fellow students falls to me. Fortunately, I'm up for the task.


[BURR]

THE TROUBLE WITH SCHOOLS IS
THEY ALWAYS TRY TO TEACH THE WRONG LESSON
BELIEVE ME, I'VE BEEN KICKED OUT OF ENOUGH OF THEM TO KNOW!
THEY WANT YOU TO BECOME LESS CALLOW, LESS SHALLOW,
BUT I SAY WHY INVITE STRESS IN?
STOP STUDYING STRIFE
AND LEARN TO LIVE
THE UNEXAMINED LIFE...
DANCIN' THROUGH LIFE
SKIMMING THE SURFACE
GLIDING WHERE TURF IS SMOOTH
LIFE IS PAINLESS FOR THE BRAINLESS
THOSE WHO DON'T TRY, NEVER LOOK FOOLISH
DANCING THROUGH LIFE
NO NEED TO TOUGH IT
WHEN YOU CAN SLUFF IT OFF AS I DO
NOTHING MATTERS, BUT KNOWING NOTHING MATTERS
IT'S JUST LIFE, SO KEEP DANCING THROUGH
DANCING THROUGH LIFE
SWAYING AND SWEEPING
AND ALWAYS KEEPING COOL
LIFE IS FRAUGHTLESS
WHEN YOU'RE THOUGHTLESS
THOSE WHO DON'T TRY
NEVER LOOK FOOLISH
DANCING THROUGH LIFE
MINDLESS AND CARELESS
MAKE SURE YOU'RE WHERE LESS TROUBLE IS RIFE
WHOES ARE FLEETING
BLOWS ARE GLANCING
WHEN YOU'RE DANCING
THROUGH LIFE!
So! What's the most swankified place in town?
[linda]

 That would be the

Sounds perfect!
LET'S GO DOWN TO THE [OzDUST BALLROOM
WE'LL MEET THERE LATER TONIGHT
WE CAN DANCE 'TIL IT'S LIGHT
FIND THE PRETTIEST GIRL
GIVE HER A WHIRL!
RIGHT ON DOWN TO THE [OzDUST BALLROOM
COME ON FOLLOW ME!
YOU'LL BE HAPPY TO BE THERE
[Students]

DANCIN' THROUGH LIFE, DOWN AT THE [OzDUST (LIFE!)
[BURR]

IF ONLY BECAUSE DUST IS WHAT WE COME TO!
[Students]

NOTHIN' MATTERS, BUT KNOWING NOTHING MATTERS
IT'S JUST LIFE!!!
[BURR]

SO KEEP DANCING THROUGH...
[Angelica]
 Miss Galinda? I hope you'll save at least one dance for me. I'll be waiting right there, right by your side, waiting, all night.
[linda]

 Oh, how very kind, Biq.
[Angelica]
 ... LAFAYETE...
[linda]

 But, do you know what would be even kinder?
SEE THAT TRAGICALLY BEAUTIFUL GIRL?
THE ONE IN THE CHAIR?
IT SEEMS SO UNFAIR
WE SHOULD GO ON A SPREE
AND NOT SHE, GEE
I KNOW SOMEONE WOULD BE MY HERO
IF THAT SOMEONE WERE
TO GO INVITE HER!
[Angelica]
 Well, maybe I could invite her!
[linda]


OH, BIQ, REALLY?
YOU WOULD DO THAT FOR ME?
[Angelica]
 I would do anything for you, Miss Galinda. Walks Over To Nessarose.
Excuse me, Miss Nessarose? There's something I'd like to ask you...
[BURR]
 To Galinda. You're good.
[linda]

 I don't know what you mean. But I do happen to be free tonight, so...
[BURR]
 So, I'll be picking you up around eight?
[linda]

 After all...
NOW THAT WE'VE MET ONE ANOTHER,
Both]
IT'S CLEAR WE DESERVE EACHOTHER!
[linda]

 You're perfect!
[BURR]
 You're perfect!
[CAST]
SO WE'RE PERFECT TOGETHER
BORN TO BE FOREVER
DANCING THROUGH LIFE!!!
[HAMILTON] It's absurd! This silly, rich boy appears and everyone's off to worship him and some cultish social gathering!
[Angelica]
 Even me! I'm going! Isn't it wonderful? LAFAYETE was too shy to ask me at first, but once Galinda encouraged him...
[HAMILTON] Galinda?!
[Angelica]
 Don't you dare say another word against her! I'm about to have the first happy night of my life all thanks to Galinda!
FINALLY FOR THIS ONE NIGHT,
I'M ABOUT TO HAVE A FUN NIGHT
WITH THIS MUNCHKIN BOY GALINDA FOUND FOR ME
AND I ONLY WISH THERE WERE
SOMETHING I COULD DO FOR HER TO REPAY HER
ELPHABA SEE...
WE DESERVE EACHOTHER AND GALINDA HELPED IT COME TRUE
WE DESERVE EACHOTHER, ME AND LAFAYETE
Please, Elphaba, try to understand.
[HAMILTON] I do...
[linda]

 Now I must accessorize myself for Fiyero.
Shen Shen Pulls The Witch's Hat Out Of One Of Galinda's Hat Boxes.
Pfanee] Galinda, what in [Oz's name!?
[linda]

 Now, just pretend you didn't see that. My granny is always giving me the most hideodeous hats.
I'd give it away, but I don't hate anyone that much.
Shen Shen] Yes you do!
Pfanee] Give it to her! Just do it!
They All Stare At Elphaba. Galinda Walks Forward, Meeting Elphaba Half Way.
[HAMILTON] Galinda, listen, Nessa and I were talking about you just now...
[linda]

 And I was just talking about you! I thought you might want to wear this hat to the party tonight! Gives Her The Hat.
IT'S REALLY... UH... SHARP!
DON'T YOU THINK?
Y'KNOW BLACK, IS THIS YEAR'S PINK!
YOU DESERVE EACHOTHER,
THIS HAT AND YOU,
YOU'RE BOTH SO... SMART!
YOU DESERVE EACHOTHER, SO HERE!
OUT OF THE GOODNESS OF MY HEART!
Galinda Runs Off. Elphaba Laughs At The Sight Of The Hat. She Exits.. The Students Enter And Dance.
When This Is Done, LAFAYETE And Nessarose Appear, Awkwardly Holding Hands.
[Angelica]
 What's in the punch?
[Angelica]
 Lemons, and melons, and pears!
[Angelica]
 Oh my!
[Angelica]

LISTEN NESSA...
[Angelica]
 Yes?
[Angelica]

UH, NESSA...
I'VE GOT SOMETHING TO CONFESS A
REASON WHY, WELL, WHY I ASKED YOU HERE TONIGHT...
NOW, I KNOW IT ISN'T FAIR.
[Angelica]
 Oh, LAFAYETE, I know why.
[Angelica]
 You do?
[Angelica]

IT'S BECAUSE I'M IN THIS CHAIR, AND YOU FELT SORRY FOR ME...
WELL, ISN'T THAT RIGHT?
[Angelica]
 No... it's because... uh... because...
BECAUSE YOU ARE SO BEAUTIFUL!
[Angelica]
 Oh, LAFAYETE!
I THINK YOU'RE WONDERFUL!
AND WE DESERVE EACH OTHER, DON'T YOU SEE THIS IS OUR CHANCE?
WE DESERVE EACH OTHER, DON'T WE LAFAYETE?
[Angelica]
 You know what? Let's dance!
[Angelica]
 What?
[Angelica]

LET'S DANCE!
They Dance, As Well As The Others Around Them. Finally, Mme. Morrible Runs Up To Galinda.
[Morrible]
 Oh, Miss Upland?
[linda]

 Madame Morrible... What are you doing here?
[Morrible]
 I have something for you. She Hands Her A Small Wand.
[linda]

 Gasps. Madame... a training wand... How can I ever express my graditution?
[Morrible]
 Oh, don't thank me! This was your roommate's idea, not mine.
[linda]

 What? Elphaba?
[Morrible]
 Miss Elphaba requested that I include you in sorcery class. She insisted I tell you this very night or she would quit the seminar.
[linda]

 But... why?
[Morrible]
 I have no idea. My personal opinion is you do not have what it takes. I hope you'll prove me wrong... I doubt you will.
She Leaves. Fiyero Comes Up To Galinda.
[BURR]
 What is it?
[linda]

 I got what I wanted...
[BURR]
 Then what's the matter?
[linda]

 Nothing...
[BURR]
 Good. Let's dance...
They Begin To Dance As Elphaba Walks In. They Stop As All The Students Gasp And Make Comments About The Way She Is Dressed. People Then Start Laughing.
[BURR]
 Who in Ozis this?
[linda]

 My roommate... please, don't ... stare!
[BURR]
 How can you help it?
Elphaba Takes Off The Hat, Noticing The Comments. She Waits, Then Puts It Back On And Begins To Dance. She Is Alone. There Is No Music.
[BURR]
 Well I'll say this, she doesn't give a twig about what anyone else thinks.
[linda]

 Of course does, she just pretends not to... I feel awful...
[BURR]
 Why? It's not like it's your fault.
[linda]

 Excuse me... She Walks Over To Elphaba and Clears Her Throat. May I cut in?
Galinda Begins Dancing Just As Horribly. The Students Now Accept It, And Begin To Dance Again As The Music Starts.
All]
DANCING THROUGH LIFE, DOWN AT THE [OzDUST
IF ONLY BECAUSE DUST IS WHAT WE COME TO
AND THE STRANGE THING, YOUR LIFE COULD END UP CHANGING
WHILE YOU'RE DANCING THROUGH

[Scene 9 - Sharing Secrets]
Elphaba & Galinda Barge Into Their Suite... Galinda Is In Hysterics.
[linda]

 Your very first party ever?! Your very first party! Oh I know! Let's tell each other something we've never told anyone... I'll go first] Fiyero and I are going to be married (squeals).
[HAMILTON] Really? He's asked you already?
[linda]

 No, he doesn't know yet... Now, you tell me a secret.
[HAMILTON] Like what?
[linda]

 Like... Why do you always sleep with this funny, little, green bottle under your pillow? Grabs The Bottle.
[HAMILTON] Give that back.
[linda]

 C'mon, tell me. Tell me tell me!
[HAMILTON] It was my mother's! That's all...
Silence.
[linda]

 Hands Her The Bottle. It's not fair. I told you a really good one.
[HAMILTON] My father hates me.
[linda]

 Gasps.
[HAMILTON] No, that's not the secret. It's my fault...
[linda]

 What is?
[HAMILTON] ... that my sister is the way she is. . Pause. You see, when my mother was carrying Nessa, my father was worried that the new baby might come out...
Both] Green.
[HAMILTON] So he made my mother chew milk flowers, day and night. But that made Nessa come too soon, with her little legs all tangled. And my mother never woke up. None of which ever would have happened if not for me.
[linda]

 But that was the milkflowers fault, not yours. That may be your secret, Elphaba, but that doesn't make it true. She Oh look, it's tomorrow! Elphie... do you mind if I call you Elphie?
[HAMILTON] Well, it's a little perky.
[linda]

 And you can call me... Galinda. So... Elphie... now that we're friends, I've decided to make you my new project!
[HAMILTON] You really don't have to do that.
[linda]

 I know, that's what makes me so nice!

[linda]


WHENEVER I SEE SOMEONE LESS FORTUNATE THAN I

WE'RE GONNA MAKE YOU POPULAR!
WHEN I SEE DEPRESSING CREATURES
WITH UNPREPOSSESSING FEATURES,
I REMIND THEM ON THEIR OWN BEHALF
TO THINK OF
CELEBRATED HEADS OF STATE
OR ESPECIALLY GREAT COMMUNICATORS
DID THEY HAVE BRAINS OR KNOWLEDGE?
DON'T MAKE ME LAUGH!
THEY WERE POPULAR
PLEASE, IT'S ALL ABOUT POPULAR
IT'S NOT ABOUT APTITUDE
IT'S THE WAY YOU'RE VIEWED
SO IT'S VERY SHREWD TO BE
VERY VERY POPULAR
LIKE ME!
[HAMILTON] This is never going to work!
[linda]

 Oh Elphie, you mustn't think that way anymore! Your whole life is going to change... and all because of me. Okay, stand... I will turn your frock into a beautiful ball gown! Stand up... She Picks Up Her Wand And Waves It. Ball gown!!! Nothing Happens, So She Repeats. Ball gown!!! Still Nothing Happens. She Taps Her Wand On The Bed. Is this thing on?
[HAMILTON] Do you want me to try?
[linda]

 No, I've got it! She Throws The Wand Down. Oh, just wear the frock... it's pretty! Now,
I'll show you how to flip your hair] Flip flip. Or you could use your hand. Demonstrates.
Or, you can use your whole body. Falls onto bed. Squeals. Now, for the finishing touch.
Takes flower out of her hair, puts it into Elphaba's. Why, Miss Elphaba, look at you, you're beautiful. Hands her the mirror.
[HAMILTON] After Looking In The Mirror. I... I have to go.
She Runs Off.
[linda]

 You're Welcome! She Admires Herself In The Mirror.
AND THOUGH YOU PROTEST
YOUR DISINTEREST,
I KNOW CLANDESTINELY...
YOU'RE GONNA GRIN AND BEAR IT
YOUR NEW FOUND POPULARITY! (SQUEALS)
LA LA LA LA
YOU'LL BE POPULAR!
JUST NOT QUITE AS POPULAR
AS ME!!!

[HAMILTON] Flips her hair.. Flip Flip! What?
[BURR]
 Nothing, it's just... you've been "Galinda-fied". You don't have to do that , you know?
[Hamilton]
 Alright, take your seats, class! I have something to say, and very little time to say it. This is my last day here at Shiz I am no longer permitted to teach. I want to thank you for your sharing your enthusiasm, your essays, no matter how feebly structured, and even, on occasion, your lunch.
Mme. Morrible Rushes In.
[Morrible]
 Doctor Dillamond! I'm so dreadfully sorry.
[HAMILTON] Madame, we've got to do something.
[Hamilton]
 Miss Elphaba, they can take away my job, but I shall continue speaking out.
Scientist] Come on, goat...
To Men Begin To Carry Him Out Of The Room.
[Hamilton]
 They are not telling you the whole story! Remember that, class! Remember that.
He Is Gone.
[HAMILTON] Doctor Dillamond! After A Pause. Well, are you just going to sit here in silence?
[Morrible]
 Miss Elphaba, there is nothing we can do. Please take your seat.
Professor] Good afternoon, students!
[Morrible]
 Good afternoon.
Professor] Every day, with every tick of the Time Dragon Clock, in every corner of our great [Oz, one hears the silence of progress. For example] this is called a cage!
He Points To A Cage With A Cloth Draped Over It. He Pulls Off The Cloth, Revealing A Lion Cub Inside.
Professor] Now, we will be seeing more and more of them in the near future. This remarkable innovation is actually for the Animal's own good...
[HAMILTON] If this is for his own good, then why is he trembling?
Professor] He's just excited to be here, that's all. Hits the cage. Now, as I was saying, one of the benefits of caging a Lion cub while he's young is that he never, in fact, will learn how to speak.
[HAMILTON] What?
He Motions The Students Forward, Toward The Cage.
Professor] That's right! Come closer!
[HAMILTON] To Fiyero. Can you imagine a world where Animals are kept in cages and they never speak?
Professor] Now, he may seem a bit agitated but that's easily remedied.
[HAMILTON] What should I do?
[BURR]
 I don't know.
[HAMILTON] Well, somebody has to... Do something!!!
Sparks Begin To Fly Everywhere. All Students & The Professor Are Moving Uncontrollably Except Fiyero and Elphaba.
[BURR]
 What's happening?
[HAMILTON] I don't know I got mad...andd
[BURR]
 Alright just don't move! And don't get mad at me... He Grabs The Cage. Well are you coming?
She Runs With Him After He Snatches The Lion Cub.
[HAMILTON] Careful! Don't shake him!
[BURR]
 I'm not!
[HAMILTON] We can't just let him loose anywhere, you know. We have to find someplace safe...
[BURR]
 Don't you think that I realize that? You must think I'm really stupid or something!
[HAMILTON] No, not really stupid.
[BURR]
 Why is it that every time I see you you're causing some sort of commotion?
[HAMILTON] I don't cause commotions, I am one.
[BURR]
 That's for sure.
[HAMILTON] Oh! So you think I should just keep my mouth shut! Is that what you're saying?
[BURR]
 No, I'm...
[HAMILTON] Do you think I want to be this way? Do you think I want to care this much? Don't you know how much easier my life would be if I didn't?
[BURR]
 Do you ever let anyone else talk?
[HAMILTON] Oh, sorry... But can I just say one more thing? You could have just walked away back there.
[BURR]
 So?
[HAMILTON] So, no matter how shallow and self-absorbed you tend to be...
[BURR]
 Excuse me, there's no pretense here. I happen to be genuinely self-absorbed and deeply shallow.
[HAMILTON] No you're not. Or you wouldn't be so unhappy.
[BURR]
 Fine, if you don't want my help...
[HAMILTON] No, I do! Poor little thing, it's heart is trembling... I didn't mean for...
[BURR]
 What did you mean to do? Why was I the only one you didn't do it to?
[HAMILTON] Oh look, you're bleeding... it must have scratched you. Referring To A Cut On His Face.
[BURR]
 Yea... or maybe it scratched me. I better get to safety... I mean the cub... get the cub to safety. He Walks Off.
[HAMILTON] Fiyero...

[[HAMILTON]
Miss Elphaba, there you are!
[HAMILTON] Madame Morrible...
[Morrible]
 Oh Miss Elphaba, I finally heard back from the Wizard!
[HAMILTON] The Wizard?
[Morrible]
 Yes, he wishes to meet you!
[HAMILTON] He asked for me?
[Morrible]
 Yes! I know how devastated you were the other day for our poor Doctor Dillamond, but I can assure you my dear, as one door closes, another one opens. She Hands Her A Green Envelope.
[HAMILTON] Madame, I don't know what to say! How can I ever thank you? She Hugs Her.
[Morrible]
 Oh careful dear, you musn't get wet She Places The Umbrella Back Over Elphaba's Head. Oh, I know! She Waves Her Hands And The Sun Comes Out. Didn't I tell you? Weather is my specialty. [Oz-speed, my dear! Make me proud.
[HAMILTON] I will, I'll try.
Morrible Exits.

[HAMILTON]
AND THERE WE'LL FINALLY BE
THE WIZARD AND I...

Conductor] All aboard!
[linda]

 Remember, eye contact. And don't forget to tell him how wonderful he is, Wizards love that! And be yourself... well... within reason.
LAFAYETE Wheels Nessarose Onstage.
[Angelica]
 Elphaba, I'm so proud of you and I know father would be too. We're all proud, aren't we?
[HAMILTON] You'll be alright, won't you?
[linda]

 She'll be fine! Biq will take care of her, right?
[Angelica]
 ...It's LAFAYETE... I... I can't do this anymore.
He Exits.
[Angelica]
 LAFAYETE...
[linda]

 Nessa, maybe he's just not the right one... for you.
[Angelica]
 No, it's me that's not right. Elphaba, just go, I'll be fine.
She Wheels Herself Offstage.
[HAMILTON] Nessa, wait!
[linda]

 Let her go. She'll have to manage without you. We all will.
[HAMILTON] Please, you'll barely even notice I'm gone. Besides, you have Fiyero. Where is he, anyway? Not that I expected him to say goodbye to me. We barely know each other.
[linda]

 I don't know him either. He's distant, and moodified, and he's been thinking, which really worrries me. I never knew how much he card about that old goat.
Fiyero Enters.
[linda]

 Oh, there he is! Fiyero, over here dearest!
[BURR]
 He Hands Elphaba Flowers. Elphaba, I'm happy for you.
[linda]

 Yes, we are both so happy...
[BURR]
 Uh, listen, I've been thinking...
[HAMILTON] Yes, I've heard.
[BURR]
 About that Lion cub and... everything. I think about that day a lot.
[HAMILTON] Really? So do I.
[linda]

 Me too! Poor Doctor Dillamond. It makes one want to... uh...
take a stand. So I've been thinking of... uh... changing my name.
[BURR]
 Your name?
[linda]

 Well, yes! Since Doctor Dillamond had his own way of pronouncing my name,
in solidarity and to express my outrage, I will henceforward be known no longer as Galinda, but as simply, Glinda.
[BURR]
 Oh well, that's very admirable of you... Glinda. To Elphaba. Elphaba, good luck.
He Runs Off.
[Burr] There, see?
[HAMILTON] Galinda...
[Burr] It's Glinda now. Stupid idea, I don't even know what made me say it.
[HAMILTON] It doesn't matter what your name is, everyone loves you!
[Burr] I don't care! I want him. I don't even think he's perfect anymore and I still want him.
This must be what other people feel like. How do they bear it? They embrace.

[HAMILTON] Come with me.
[Burr] Where?
[HAMILTON] To the Emerald City.
[Burr] Really?
[Ozia]

ONE SHORT DAY, IN THE EMERALD CITY...

[Burr] Say something!
[HAMILTON] Uh... Elphaba Thropp your terribleness!
His Speaks Normally.
[Hamilton]
Oh? Is that you Elphaba? I didn't realize!
He Climbs Out Of The Head.
[Hamilton]
I hope I didn't startle you, it's so hard to make out peoples' faces all the way back there.
So, let's see... which is which? Elphaba! He grabs her hands. And you must be.
[Burr] Glinda. The Ga is silent.
Elphaba touches the Ozmask.
[Hamilton]
I know. It isn't much, is it? But people expect this sort of thing. You have to give people what they want.
The thing is, I hardly ever let people meet the real me, but this being special occasion.
[HAMILTON] I'm so happy to meet you.
[Hamilton]
Well, that's good. 'Cause that's what I love best] making people happy!

ALLOWS ME TO FEEL SO PARENTAL.
FOR I AM
A SENTIMENTAL MAN!
[HAMILTON] I'm here... we're here to alert you that something bad is happening...
[Hamilton]
Please, I'm the Wizard of [Oz. I already know why you've come.
Elphaba & [Burr] Oooo.
[Hamilton]
Of course, you must prove yourself...
[Burr] Prove yourself, prove yourself.
[HAMILTON] But how?
[Hamilton]
Oh, I don't know.
SOME SORT OF GESTURE
MOSTLY FOR SHOW
SOMETHING TO TEST YOUR ADEPTNESS..
I know! Madame, the book!
Morrible Enters.
[Burr] Madame Morrible...
[Hamilton]
I believe you're well acquainted with my new Press Secretary.
[HAMILTON] Press Secretary?
[Morrible]
 Oh, yes dearies, I've risen up in the world. You'll find that the Wizard is a very generous man.
If you do something for him, he'll do much for you.
[HAMILTON] What do yhou want me to do?
[Hamilton]
Well, this is my monkey servent, Chistery. He looks so longingly at the birds every morning....
[Morrible]
 So the Wizard was thinking, perhaps, a levitation spell...
[Burr] Noticing A Book In Morrible's Hands. Is that the Grimmerie?
[Morrible]
 Yes, the ancient book of spells and enchantments. Hands It To Elphaba.
[Burr] Whispers. Can I touch it?
Morrlbe] Whispers. No!
[HAMILTON] What funny writing...
[Morrible]
 Well it's a lost language. The lost language of spells.
[Hamilton]
It's kind of a recipe book for change.
[Morrible]
 Don't be discouraged if you can't decipherate it, dearie.
I, myself, can only read a spell or two, and that took years and years
[HAMILTON]
AHVEN, TATEY, AVEN TATEY AVEN...
[Hamilton]
She Continues Chanting. Oh, Chistery, what a experience you are about to have!
[HAMILTON] .................................. AH MAY AH TAY ATUM
[Hamilton]
SINCE ONCE I HAVE MY OWN DAY IN THE SKY...
[HAMILTON] AH MAY AH TAH TAY MAY TU SE SAY TA!
[Hamilton]
I KNOW EVERYONE DESERVES THE CHANCE TO FLY!
Chistery Screams & Begins To Twitch.
[HAMILTON] What happened? Is something wrong?
[Morrible]
 No just a transition, dearie.
[HAMILTON] No, stop you're hurting him!
[Hamilton]
She's actually done it!
Chistery Sprouts Wings. And Begins Running Around The Stage.
[HAMILTON] NO! Quick, how do I reverse it?
[Morrible]
 You can't!
[HAMILTON] What?!
[Morrible]
 You can't! Spells are irreversible! I knew she had the power, I told you!
[HAMILTON] You planned all this?
[Morrible]
 Well, you benefit too, dearie! You benefit, too.
[Hamilton]
And this is only the beginning! Look.
The Other Monkeys Begin To Grow Wings And Fly.
[Morrible]
 Won't they make perfect spies?
[HAMILTON] Spies?!
[Hamilton]
You're right, that's a harsh word... how about scouts? That's what they'll be really. They'll fly around [Oz! Report any subversive Animal activity.
[HAMILTON] You can't read this book at all! Can you? That's why you need enemies, and cages, and spies. You have no real power.
[Hamilton]
Exactly... that's why I need you. Don't you see? The world is your oyster, now! You have so many...opportunites. You both do.
[Burr] Thank you, your [Ozness.
Wizard]
SINCE ONCE I HAD MY OWN DAY IN THE SKY
I KNOW EVERYONE DESERVES THE CHANCE TO...
[HAMILTON] NO!
She Runs Off.
[Morrible]
 Elphaba!
[Burr] Elphie! I am so sorry, your Wizardship. I'll fetch her back! Elphie wait!
She Runs After Her.
[Hamilton]
We must get her back. She knows too much.
[Morrible]
 Don't worry! I will handle it.
He Gets Back In The Head. Speaking, Again, With A Powerful Voice.
[Hamilton]
Guards, guards! There is a fugitive loose in the palace! Find her, capture her, and bring her to me!
Guards] Yes your [Ozness!

[Burr] Elphie, wait! Where are you going?
[HAMILTON] Oh no! There are no more stairs! This might be the attic...
[Burr] Elphaba, listen to me...
[HAMILTON] I have to barricade the door! She Picks Up A Broom And Places It Over A Trap Door.
[Burr] Elphaba, why couldn't you have stayed calm for once instead of flying off the handle?
I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY
I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY NOW
I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY HOW YOU'VE HURT YOUR CAUSE FOREVER
I HOPE YOU THINK YOU'RE CLEVER
[HAMILTON]
I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY! I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY TOO
I HOPE YOU'RE PROUD HOW YOU WOULD GROVEL IN SUBMISSION
TO FEED YOUR OWN AMBISSION
Both]
SO THOUGH I CAN'T IMAGINE HOW
I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY
RIGHT NOW...
[Morrible]
 Citizens of [Oz, there is an enemy that must be found and captured! Believe nothing she says. She's evil. Responsible for the mutilation of these poor, innocent monkeys! Her green skin is but an outward manifestation of her twisted nature! This distortion... this repulsion... this... Wicked Witch!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[Burr] Don't be afraid...
[HAMILTON] I'm not... it's the Wizard who should be afraid... of me!
[Burr] Elphie, just say you're sorry before it's too late.
YOU CAN STILL BE WITH THE WIZARD
WHAT YOU'VE WORKED AND WAITED FOR
YOU CAN HAVE ALL YOU EVER WANTED...
[HAMILTON] I know...
BUT I DON'T WANT IT
NO, I CAN'T WANT IT
ANYMORE...
SOMETHING HAS CHANGED WITHIN ME
SOMETHING IS NOT THE SAME
I'M THROUGH WITH PLAYING BY THE RULES
OF SOMEONE ELSE'S GAME!
TOO LATE FOR SECOND GUESSING
TOO LATE TO GO BACK TO SLEEP
IT'S TIME TO TRUST MY INSTINCTS
CLOSE MY EYES...
AND LEAP
IT'S TIME TO TRY DEFYING GRAVITY
I THINK I'LL TRY DEFYING GRAVITY
AND YOU CAN'T PULL ME DOWN
[Burr]
CAN'T I MAKE YOU UNDERSTAND
YOU'RE HAVING DELUSIONS OF GRANDURE?
[HAMILTON]
I'M THROUHG EXCEPTING LIMITS
'CUZ SOMEONE SAYS THEY'RE SO
SOME THINGS I CANNOT CHANGE,
BUT 'TIL I TRY I'LL NEVER KNOW!
TOO LONG I'VE BEEN AFRAID OF
LOSING LOVE I GUESS I'D LOST
WELL IF THAT'S LOVE,
IT COMES AT MUCH TOO HIGH A COST!
I'D SOONER BUY DEFYING GRAVITY
KISS ME GOODBYE I'M DEFYING GRAVITY
AND YOU CAN'T PULL ME DOWN!
The Guards Bang On The Locked Door.
[Guard]
 Open this door, in the name of his supreme [Ozness!
[HAMILTON] Ah May Ah Tay Ah Tum Ditum...
[Burr]
That's what started all this in the first place... that hideous levitation spell! STOP!!!
[Burr] Well... Where are your wings? Maybe you're not as powerful as you think you are...
A Broomstick Floats Across The Room Towards Elphaba.
[HAMILTON] I told you, Glinda... I did it, I tell ya!
The Guards Bang On The Door Once Again.
[HAMILTON] Quick! Get on!
[Burr] What?
[HAMILTON] Come with me... think of what we could do... together.
UNLIMITED, TOGETHER WE'RE UNLIMITED
TOGETHER WE'LL BE THE GREATEST TEAM THERE'S EVER BEEN, GLINDA
DREAMS THE WAY WE PLANNED 'EM
[Burr]
IF WE WORK IN TANDEM
Both]
JUST YOU AND I DEFYING GRAVITY
WITH YOU AND I DEFYING GRAVITY
[HAMILTON]
THEY'LL NEVER BRING US DOWN.
Well, are you coming?
[Burr] Elphie, you're trembling... here, put this around you...
She Drapes A Black Cape Around Her.
I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY
NOW THAT YOU'RE CHOOSING THIS
[HAMILTON] You too.
I HOPE IT BRINGS YOU BLISS
Both]
I REALLY HOPE YOU GET IT
AND YOU DON'T LIVE TO REGRET IT
I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY IN THE END!
I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY...
MY FRIEND...
Elphaba Runs Off. The Guards Break Down The Door.
[Guard]
 There she is! Don't let her get away!
They Grab Hold Of Glinda.
[Burr]
What in [Oz?! Let go of me! Do you hear me? Let go!
[HAMILTON]
It's not her. She has nothing to do with. I'm the one you want. It's me. Hahahahaha. It's me! Up here! It's me!
She Rises Up Center Stage Holding Her Broom.
[HAMILTON]
SO IF YOU CARE TO FIND ME,
LOOK TO THE WESTERN SKY
AS SOMEONE TOLD ME LATELY,
EVERYONE DESERVES THE CHANCE TO FLY!
AND IF I'M FLYING SOLO,
AT LEAST I'M FLYING FREE!
TO THOSE WHO GROUND ME,
TAKE A MESSAGE BACK FROM ME!
TELL THEM HOW I AM DEFYING GRAVITY!!!
I'M FLYING HIGH DEFYING GRAVITY!!!
AND SOON I'LL MATCH THEM IN RENOWN
AND NOBODY
IN ALL OF [Oz...
NO WIZARD THAT THERE IS OR WAS
IS EVER GONNA BRING
ME DOWN!!!

[Ozians

The Act Opens With [Ozians.

[Ozia]

EVERY DAY THE WICKED
EVERY DAY THE TERROR GROWS
ALL OF OzIS EVER ON ALERT
THAT'S THE WAY WITH WICKED-
SPREADING FEAR WHERE E'ER SHE GOES
SEEKING OUT NEW VICTIMS SHE CAN HURT!
[Ozian Woman]
LIKE SOME TERRIBLE GREEN BLIZZARD
THROUGHOUT THE LAND SHE FLIES...
[Ozian Man]
DEFAMING OUR POOR WIZARD
[Ozia]

WITH HER CALUMNIES AND LIES
SHE LIES!
SAVE US FROM THE WICKED
SHIELD US SO WE WON'T BE HEXED
GIVE US WARNING
WHERE WILL SHE STRIKE NEXT
WHERE WILL SHE STRIKE NEXT
WHERE WILL SHE STRIKE NEXT
Glinda, Fiyero and Morrible Appear Onstage On APodium.
[Burr] Fellow [Ozians, as terrifying as terror is, let us put aside our panic for this one day... and celebrate!
OH WHAT A CELEBRATION WE'LL HAVE TODAY!
[Ozia]

THANK GOODNESS!
[Burr]
LET'S HAVE A CELEBRATION THE GLINDA WAY!
[Ozia]

THANK GOODNESS!
[Morrible]

FINALLY A DAY THAT'S TOTALLY WICKED WITCH FREE
All]
WE COULDN'T BE HAPPIER
THANK GOODNESS!
[Morrible]
 And thank goodness for you, Glinda, and your handsome swain, our new captain of the guard.
To Fiyero. Now you've been at the forefront of the hunt for the Wicked Witch, haven't you?
[BURR]
 Not really, but I don't like to think of her as a Wicked Witch.
[Morrible]
 Captain, how does it feel?
[BURR]
 Frustrating... but I became captain of the guard to find her, and I will keep searching!
[Morrible]
 No, being engaged!
[Ozia]
 Congratulotions!
[BURR]
 To Glinda - Confused. This is an engagement party?
[Burr] Surprised?
[BURR]
 Yes!
[Burr] Good, we hoped you'd be... the Wizard and I!
WE COULDN'T BE HAPPIER
RIGHT DEAR?
COULDN'T BE HAPPIER
RIGHT HERE
LOOK WHAT WE'VE GOT
A FAIRY TALE PLOT
OUR VERY OWN HAPPY ENDING
WHERE WE COULDN'T BE HAPPIER
TRUE DEAR?
COULDN'T BE HAPPIER
AND WE'RE HAPPY TO SHARE OUR ENDING VICARIOUSLY
WITH ALL OF YOU!
HE COULDN'T LOOK HANDSOMER
I COULDN'T BE HUMBLER
BECAUSE HAPPY IS WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN ALL YOUR DREAMS COME TRUE...
[Morrible]
 And Glinda, dear, we're happy for you! As Press Secretary,
I have striven to ensure that all of Ozknows the story of your braverism! How I vividly remember...
THE DAY YOU WERE FIRST SUMMONED
TO AN AUDIENCE WITH [Oz,
AND ALTHOUGH HE WOULD NOT TELL YOU WHY INITIALLY
WHEN YOU BOWED BEFORE HIS THROWN
HE DECREED YOU'D HENCE BE KNOWN
AS GLINDA THE GOOD
OFFICIALLY!
[BURR]
 That's not how you described it to me.
[Burr] Oh no, not exactly, but Whispers we'll talk about it later.
[Morrible]

THEN WITH A JEALOUS SQUEEE
THE WICKED WITCH BURST FROM CONCEALMENT
WHERE SHE HAD BEEN LURKING
SURREPTITIALLY!
Gasps From Among The Crowd.
[Ozian]
I HEAR SHE HAS AN EXTRA EYE THAT ALWAYS REMAINS AWAKE!
[Ozian]
I HEAR THAT SHE CAN SHED HER SKIN AS EASILY AS A SNAKE!
[Ozian]
I HEAR SOME REBEL ANIMALS ARE GIVING HER FOOD AND SHELTER!
[Ozian]
I HEAR HER SOUL IS SO UNCLEAN, PURE WATER CAN MELT HER!
[BURR]
 What?
[Ozia]

MELT HER! PLEASE SOMEBODY GO AND MELT HER!
[BURR]
 Do you hear that?! Water will melt her? People are so empty-headed they'll believe anything!
[Burr] Excuse me just a tick-tock!
Her And Fiyero Talk Aside.
[BURR]
 I can't just stand here grinning pretending to go along with all of this!
[Burr] Do you think I like to hear them say those awful things about her? I hate it!
[BURR]
 Then what are we doing here? Let's go, let's get out of here!
[Burr] We can't leave now, not when people are looking to us to raise their spirits.
[BURR]
 You can't leave, because you can't resist this. And that is the truth.
[Burr] Maybe I can't. Is that so wrong? Who could?
[BURR]
 You know who could. Who has.
[Burr] Fiyero, I miss her too, but we can't just stop living. No one has searched harder for her than you. But don't you see? She doesn't want to be found. We have to face it.
[BURR]
 You're right. I'm sorry, you're right. And if it's going tol make you happy, of course I'll marry you.
[Burr] But it'll make you happy too, right?
[BURR]
 You know me... I'm always happy. He Runs Off.
[Burr] Fiyero! Thanks plenty dearest! He's gone to fetch me a refreshment, he's so thoughtful that way!
THAT'S WHY I COULDN'T BE HAPPIER
NO, I COULDN'T BE HAPPIER
THOUGH IT IS I ADMIT, THE TINIEST BIT
UNLIKE I ANTICIPATED,
BUT I COULDN'T BE HAPPIER
SIMPLY COULDN'T BE HAPPIER...
Well, not simply...
'CUZ GETTING YOUR DREAMS, IT'S STRANGE BUT IT SEEMS
A LITTLE, WELL, COMPLICATED...
THERE'S A KIND OF A SORT OF COST
THERE'S A COUPLE OF THINGS GET LOST...
THERE ARE BRIDGES YOU CROSSED YOU DIDN'T KNOW YOU CROSSED UNTIL YOU'VE CROSSED!
AND IF THAT JOY THAT THRILL
DOESN'T THRILL LIKE YOU THINK IT WILL...
STILL... WITH THIS PERFECT FINALE
THE CHEERS AND THE BALLYHOO
WHO WOULDN'T BE HAPPIER?
SO I COULDN'T BE HAPPIER
BECAUSE HAPPY IS WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN ALL YOUR DREAMS COME TRUE...
WELL, ISN'T IT?
HAPPY IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOUR DREAMS COME...
TRUE!!!!
[Ozia]

WE LOVE YOU GLINDA IF WE MAY BE SO FRANK!
[Burr]
THANK GOODNESS!
[Ozia]

FOR ALL THIS JOY WE KNOW WHO WE'VE GOT TO THANK!
THANK GOODNESS!
THAT MEANS THE WIZARD, GLINDA...
[Burr]
AND FIANCE!
[Ozia]

WE COULDN'T BE LUCKIER!
[Burr] I COULDN'T BE HAPPIER!!!
[Ozia]
 THANK GOODNESS!!!
[Burr] TODAY!!!!
[Ozia]
 TODAY, THANK GOODNESS FOR TODAY!


[Angelica]
 Will there be anything else, Madame?
[Angelica]
 I've asked you to call me Nessarose, remember?
[Angelica]
 Yes, Madame. He Exits.
[Angelica]
 LAFAYETE...
Elphaba's Voice Is Heard Inside A Closet.
[HAMILTON] Well, it seems the beautiful only get more beautiful, Nessarose Screams while the green just get greener.
Nessarose Is Scared And Confused.
Elphaba Steps Out Of The Closet.
[HAMILTON] I'm sorry. Did I scare you? I seem to have that effect on people. It's good to see you.
[Angelica]
 What are you doing here?
[HAMILTON] Well, there's no place like home. I never thought I'd hear myself say this but I need father's help. I need him to stand with me.
[Angelica]
 That's impossible.
[HAMILTON] No, no it's not. Not if you ask him. You know he'll listen to you.
[Angelica]
 Father's dead.
[HAMILTON] What?
[Angelica]
 He's dead. I'm the governor... Well what did you expect? After he learned what you'd done,
how you'd disgraced u,s he died... of shame. Embarrassed to death.
[HAMILTON] Good, I'm glad. It's better that way.
[Angelica]
 That's a wicked thing to say.
[HAMILTON] No, it's true. Because now it's just us. You can help me and together we can...
[Angelica]
 Elphaba, shut up! First of all, I can't harbor a fugitive, I'm an un-elected official!
And why should I help you? You fly around [Oz, trying to rescue animals you've never even met,
and not once have you ever thought to use your powers to rescue me!
ALL OF MY LIFE, I'VE DEPENDED ON YOU
HOW DO YOU THINK THAT FEELS?
ALL OF MY LIFE I'VE DEPENDED ON YOU
AND THIS HIDEOUS CHAIR WITH WHEELS!
SCROUNGING FOR SCRAPS OF PITY TO PICK UP
AND LONGING TO KICK UP
MY HEELS...
[HAMILTON] Nessa, there isn't a spell for everything! The power is mysterious.
It's not like coddling up a pair of... She Pulls Out The Grimmerie From Her Bag. Wait.
[Angelica]
 What are you doing?
Elphaba Begins Chanting.
[Angelica]
 What is that? Ah! My shoes! It feels like... like they're on fire! What have you done to my shoes???
She Lifts Her Dress, Revealing The Ruby Slippers. Nessarose Stands, But Falls. Elphaba Gives Her A Hand.
[Angelica]
 No, don't help me. She Stands.
[HAMILTON] Oh, Nessa, at last...
I'VE DONE WHAT LONG AGO I SHOULD
AND FINALLY FROM THESE POWERS SOMETHING GOOD
FINALLY SOMETHING GOOD...
[Angelica]
 LAFAYETE! LAFAYETE! Come quickly!
[HAMILTON] LAFAYETE?
[Angelica]
 LAFAYETE! Come here at once!
[HAMILTON] No! Nessa, listen, nobody can know I'm here!
Nessarose Runs Behind The Closet As LAFAYETE Enters.
[Angelica]
 Yes, what is it, Madame?
[HAMILTON] LAFAYETE...
[Angelica]
 What are you doing here? You stay back!
[HAMILTON] LAFAYETE, it's just me, I'm not going to hurt you!
[Angelica]
 No! You're lying! That's all you ever do! You and your sister! She's as wicked as you are!
[HAMILTON] What are you talking about?
[Angelica]
 I'm talking about my life. The little that's left of it. I'm not free to leave Munchkinland, none of us are.
Ever since she took power, she's been stripping the Munchkins of our rights...
and we didn't have that many to begin with! And do you know why?
Nessarose Reveals Herself In The Chair.
[Angelica]
 To keep you here, with me. But none of that matters anymore. Look.
Nessarose Stands Up.
[Angelica]
 To Elphaba. You did this for her?
[Angelica]
 For both of us!
[Angelica]
 Nessa, this changes everything.
[Angelica]
 I know.
[Angelica]

LISTEN NESSA...
[Angelica]
 What?
[Angelica]

UH NESSA, SURELY NOW I'LL MATTER LESS TO YOU
AND YOU WON'T MIND MY LEAVING HERE TONIGHT...
[Angelica]
 Leaving?
[Angelica]
 Yes...
THAT BALL THAT'S BEING STAGED
ANNOUNCING GLINDA IS ENGAGED
[Angelica]
 Glinda?
[Angelica]

YES NESSA THAT'S RIGHT!
I'VE GOT TO GO APPEAL TO HER
EXPRESS THE WAY I FEEL TO HER
Oh, Nessa, I lost my heart to Glinda from the moment I first saw her. You know that.
[Angelica]
 Lost your heart? Well, we'll see about that...
[HAMILTON] Nessa, let him go...
[Angelica]

DID YOU THINK I'D LET YOU LEAVE ME HERE FLAT?
[Angelica]
 Don't come any closer!
YOU'RE GOING TO LOSE YOUR HEART TO ME, I TELL YOU!
IF I HAVE TO... I HAVE TO...
Sees The Grimmerie.
MAGIC SPELL YOU...
She Grabs The Book.
[Angelica]
 Ah... Tum... Tah... Tae...
Elphaba Reveals Herself.
[HAMILTON] Nessa, stop!
[Angelica]
 What is she doing?!
[HAMILTON] No, Nessa, you're pronouncing the words all wrong!
[HAMILTON] Nessa!
[Angelica]
 LAFAYETE! What is it?
[Angelica]
 Gasps. My heart feels like it's... shrinking.
[Angelica]
 Elphaba, do something!
[HAMILTON] I can't! You can't reverse a spell once it's been cast!
[Angelica]
 So what do we do?
LAFAYETE Falls Into Nessa's Empty Wheel Chair. Elphaba Wheels Him Behind The Closet.
[Angelica]
 Elphaba, do something!
[Angelica]
 This is all your fault! If you hadn't shown me that horrendible book.
[HAMILTON] I have to find another spell... it's the only thing that might work. She Goes Behind The Closet As Well.
[Angelica]
 Save him, please!
JUST SAVE HIM, MY POOR LAFAYETE, MY SWEET MY BRAVE,
DON'T LEAVE ME 'TIL MY SORRY LIFE HAS CEASED...
Elphaba Wheels The Chair Out, Which Is Not Facing The Audience And Is Seen Casting A Spell.
ALL ALONE AND LOVELESS HERE
JUST THE GIRL IN THE MIRROR
JUST HER AND ME! THE WICKED WITCH OF THE EAST!
WE DESERVE EACH OTHER...
[Angelica]
 Well... what about his heart?
[HAMILTON] It's all right. He won't need one now. I have to go. I have business to attend to in the Emerald City.
Nessa, I have done everything I could for you but it has never been enough and it never will be...
She Leaves.
[Angelica]
 Elphaba, wait! Elphaba!
LAFAYETE Wakes Up.
[Angelica]
 Where am I? What happened?
[Angelica]
 Nothing, LAFAYETE, you just fell asleep... and...
He Sits Up, Squeaking. He Is Made Of Tin. Nessarose Screams.
[Angelica]
 What is it, what's wrong?
[Angelica]
 No, it wasn't me it was her! I tried to stop her.
LAFAYETE Screams Uncontrollably And Runs Off.
[Angelica]
 LAFAYETE, please listen! It was Elphaba! LAFAYETE! It was Elphaba!!!

[Hamilton]
[HAMILTON] Well you have, you have harmed me.
[Hamilton]
I realize that, and I regret it. Elphaba...
[HAMILTON] There you are! I'm setting those monkeys free! And don't try to interfere, or call the guards...
[Hamilton]
I'm not calling anyone. The truth is I'm glad to see you again. It gets pretty lonely around here. And I know you must get lonely too.
[HAMILTON] You don't know the first thing about me.
[Hamilton]
Oh, but I do. I do know you. I can't explain it exactly. You know what I mean? Elphaba, you've been so strong through all of this, aren't you tired of being the strong one? Wouldn't you like someone to take care of you? He Hands Her Back The Broom. Please, help me start again.
[HAMILTON] Don't you think I wish I could? That I could go back to the time when I believed you really were wonderful? The Wonderful Wizard of [Oz? Nobody believed in you more than I did.
[Hamilton]
Oh, my dear child...
I NEVER ASKED FOR THIS OR PLANNED IT IN ADVANCE
I WAS MERELY BLOWN HERE BY THE WINDS OF CHANCE
I NEVER SAW MYSELF AS A SOLOMON OR SOCRATES
I KNEW WHO I WAS, ONE OF YOUR DIME A D[OzEN MEDIOCRATES
THEN SUDDENLY I'M HERE, RESPECTED, WORSHIPED EVEN
JUST BECAUSE THE FOLKS IN OzNEEDED SOMEONE TO BELIEVE IN
DOES IT SURPRISE YOU I GOT HOOKED AND ALL TOO SOON
WHAT CAN I SAY? I GOT CARRIED AWAY
AND NOT JUST BY BALLOON...
WONDERFUL
THEY CALLED ME WONDERFUL
SO I SAID, WONDERFUL, IF YOU INSIST
I WILL BE WONDERFUL
AND THEY SAID WONDERFUL
BELIEVE ME IT'S HARD TO RESIST
'CUZ IT FEELS WONDERFUL
THEY THINK I'M WONDERFUL
HEY LOOK WHO'S WONDERFUL
THIS CORN-FED HICK!
WHO SAID IT MIGHT BE KEEN
TO BUILD A TOWN OF GREEN
AND A WONDERFUL ROAD OF YELLOW BRICK!
See, I never had a family of my own since I was always traveling, and I guess I just wanted to give the citizens of Ozeverything.
[HAMILTON] So you lied to them?
[Hamilton]
Only verbally. Besides, they were the lies they wanted to hear. Elphaba, where I come from we believe all sorts of things that aren't true... we call it history!
A MAN'S CALLED A TRAITOR
OR LIBERATOR
A RICH MAN'S A THIEF
OR PHILANTHROPIST
IS ONE A CRUSADER
OR RUTHLESS INVADER
IT'S ALL IN THE LABEL WHICH IS ABLE TO PERSIST
THERE ARE PRECIOUS FEW AT EASE
WITH MORAL AMBIGUITIES
SO WE ACT AS THOUGH THEY DON'T EXIST...
THEY CALL ME WONDERFUL
SO I AM
INFACT, IT'S SO MUCH WHO I AM IT'S PART OF MY NAME!
AND WITH MY HELP YOU CAN BE THE SAME...
AT LONG, LONG LAST RECEIVE YOUR DUE
LONG OVERDUE
ELPHABA, THE MOST CELEBRATED
ARE THE REHABILITATED
THERE'LL SUCH A WHOOPDEE DOO!
A CELEBRATION THROUGHOUT [Oz,
THAT'S ALL TO DO WITH YOU!
WONDERFUL, THEY'LL CALL YOU WONDERFUL!
[HAMILTON]
THAT DOES SOUND WONDERFUL!
Wizard]
TRUST ME IT'S FUN!!!
Both]
WHEN YOU ARE WONDERFUL,
IT WOULD BE WONDERFUL!
WONDERFUL, WONDERFUL
Wizard]
ONE, TWO AND...
They Dance.
[HAMILTON]
I'LL ACCEPT YOUR PROPOSITION
[Hamilton]
Wonderful
[HAMILTON]
ON ONE CONDITION
[Hamilton]
Yes?
[HAMILTON] You set those Monkeys free.
[Hamilton]
Done.

[HAMILTON] Go! Fly! You're Free! Fly! Chistery, Chistery, you're free, isn't it wonderful?! Go, fly! She Makes Her Way To Another "Monkey" Covered By A Sheet.
[Hamilton]
No! No! Please!
She Pulls Off The Cover, Revealing Dr. Dillamond.
[HAMILTON] No! It can't be! Doctor Dillamond...
[Hamilton]
Elphaba, we just couldn't keep letting him speak out...
[HAMILTON] Doctor Dillamond, are you alright? Don't be afraid. It's me, Elphaba.
[Hamilton]
 Bahhhhh.
[HAMILTON] Doctor, don't you remember me?
[Hamilton]
 Bahhhhh.
[HAMILTON] Can't you speak?
[Hamilton]
 Bahhhhh.
[HAMILTON] No... We have nothing in common. I am nothing like you and I never will be and I will fight you until the day I die!!!
The Wizard Climbs Into The Head And Dr. Dillamond Runs Offstage.

[Hamilton]
Guards, guards!!!
Fiyero Runs In With His Men.
[Guard]
 Halt!
[BURR]
 Are you alright, your [Ozness?
[HAMILTON] Fiyero!
[BURR]
 I don't believe it...
[HAMILTON] Oh , Fiyero, thank God. I thought you were...
[BURR]
 Silence witch!!!
[Guard]
 There's a Goat on the lam, sir.
[BURR]
 Never mind all that. Fetch me some... some water.
[Guard]
 Water, sir?
[BURR]
 You heard me, as much as you can carry.
Guards] Yes, sir!
They March Off.
[HAMILTON] Fiyero...
[BURR]
 I said silence!
[Hamilton]
He Runs Out Of The Head. No! No!
[BURR]
 Don't make a sound, your [Ozness, unless you want all your guests to know the truth about the Wonderful Wizard of [Oz... Elphaba, I'll find Doctor Dillamond later, no get out of here.
[HAMILTON] Fiyero, you frightened me. I thought, I though you might have changed.
[BURR]
 I have... changed.
Glinda Enters.
[Burr] What's going on... Elphie? Oh, thank Ozyou're alive! Only you shouldn't have come. If anyone discoverates you ...
[BURR]
 Glinda, you'd better go.
[Burr] Fiyero, what are you...
[BURR]
 Please, just go back to the ball.
[Burr] Your [Ozness, he means no disrespectation. Please understand! You see, we all went to school together...
[BURR]
 Elphaba!
[Burr] Fiyero, have you misplaced your mind? What are you doing?
[BURR]
 I'm going with her.
[Burr] What? What are you saying? You mean all this time... the two of you... behind my back...
[HAMILTON] No, Glinda it wasn't like that!
[BURR]
 Actually, it was...but it wasn't...Elphaba, let's go... let's go!
They Run Off.
[Burr] Fine, go! You deserve each other...
The Wizard Holds A Small Bottle With A Green Liquid.
[Hamilton]
Here, have a swig of this, it dulls the pain.
[Burr] No, thank you.
Mme. Morrible Enters, Laughing.
[Morrible]
 Oh, is it true? Your betrothed has taken her into custody?
[Hamilton]
Our new captain of the guard had other plans.
[Morrible]
 You mean she hasn't been captured?
[Hamilton]
Quite the contrary. And considering how well she eluded us last time...
[Morrible]
 Well, we'll just flush her out and force her to show herself.
[Hamilton]
But how?
[Burr] Her sister
[Morrible]
 What? What did she say?
[Burr] Use her sister. Spread a rumor. Make her think her sister is in trouble and she will fly to her side... and you'll have her.
[Hamilton]
Exactly so.
[Burr] Now, if your [Ozness will excuse me I have a slight headache, I think I'll lie down.
She Walks Out.
[Morrible]
 Yes, well...a rumor won't do it. Elphaba's too smart for that.
[Hamilton]
Far too smart.
[Morrible]
 Perhaps, a change in the weather...

[Burr]
DON'T WISH, DON'T START
WISHING ONLY WOUNDS THE HEART...
THERE'S A GIRL I KNOW, HE LOVES HER SO...
I'M NOT THAT GIRL...

Only Elphaba & Fiyero Are On Stage, In The Woods
[HAMILTON]
KISS ME TOO FIERCELY, HOLD ME TOO TIGHT
I NEED HELP BELIEVING YOU'RE WITH ME TONIGHT
MY WILDEST DREAMINGS COULD NOT FORSEE
LYING BESIDE YOU WITH YOU WANTING ME
IF JUST FOR THIS MOMENT
AS LONG AS YOU'RE MINE
I'VE LOST ALL RESISTANCE
AND CROSSED SOME BORDERLINE
AND IF IT TURNS OUT
IT'S OVER TOO FAST
I'LL MAKE EVERY LAST MOMENT LAST
AS LONG AS YOU'RE MINE...
[BURR]

MAYBE I'M BRAINLESS, MAYBE I'M WISE,
BUT YOU'VE GOT ME SEEING THROUGH DIFFERENT EYES,
SOMEHOW I'VE FALLEN UNDER YOUR SPELL
AND SOMEHOW I'M FEELING
IT'S UP THAT I FELL
Both]
EVERY MOMENT, AS LONG AS YOU'RE MINE
I'LL WAKE UP MY BODY
AND MAKE UP FOR LOST TIME
[BURR]

SAY THERE'S NO FUTURE
FOR US AS A PAIR...
Both]
AND THOUGH I MAY KNOW,
I DON'T CARE
IF JUST FOR THIS MOMENT
AS LONG AS YOU'RE MINE
COME BE HOW YOU WANT TO
AND SEE HOW BRIGHT WE SHINE!
BORROW THE MOONLIGHT
UNTIL IT IS THROUGH
AND KNOW I'LL BE HERE HOLDING YOU...
AS LONG AS YOU'RE MINE...
[BURR]
 What is it?
[HAMILTON] It's just... for the first time... I feel... wicked.

[HAMILTON] I just wish...
[BURR]
 What?
[HAMILTON] I wish I could be beautiful... for you.
[BURR]
 Elphaba...
[HAMILTON] Don't tell me that I am, you don't need to lie to me.
[BURR]
 It's not lying! It's... uh... it's looking at things another way. Someday, you and Glinda will make up and we'll all...
[HAMILTON] Shh! Listen... Do you hear that? A Shriek Is Heard In The Distance. It sounds like somebody in pain.
[BURR]
 It's just the wind.
[HAMILTON] The Siren Is Heard Again. My sister's in danger.
[BURR]
 What? How do you know?
[HAMILTON] I don't know, I just do... Gasps.
[BURR]
 Elphaba what's wrong, what is it?
[HAMILTON] This! Don't you see it?
[BURR]
 What do you mean? What do you see?
[HAMILTON] It doesn't make any sense... It's a house but it's... it's flying through the sky? I have to go to Nessa!
[BURR]
 I'll come with you!
[HAMILTON] No, you mustn't, it's too dangerous!
[BURR]
 Listen to me, listen! My family has a castle in Kiamo Ko. Now, no one is ever there except for the sentries who watch over it. We've never lived there.
[HAMILTON] Where do you live?
[BURR]
 In the other castle... It's the perfect hiding place; tunnels, secret passageways. You'll be safe there.
[HAMILTON] We will see each other again, won't we?
[BURR]
 Elphaba, we are going to be together always. You can see houses flying through the sky, can't you see that?
They Embrace And Elphaba Runs Off.
Glinda Enters. There Is A House In The Background. The Edge OF The Yellow Brick Road Can Be Seen.
[Burr] That's right, you just take that one road, the whole time. Waves offstage. Oh, I hope they don't get lost. I'm so bad at giving directions. She sees the house, picks up flowers and lays them in front of the house. Oh, Nessa.
Elphaba Appears.
[HAMILTON] What a touching display of grief.
[Burr] I don't think we have anything further to say to one another.
[HAMILTON] I wanted something to remember her by, and all that is left were those shoes, and now that wretched little farm girl has walked off with them. So I'd appreciate some time, alone, to say goodbye to my sister.
Glinda Backs Away As Elphaba Walks Toward The House.
[HAMILTON] Nessa, please, please, please forgive me...
[Burr] Elphie... you mustn't blame yourself. It's dreadful, it is, to have a house fall on you, but accidents will happen.
[HAMILTON] You call this an accident?
[Burr] Yes! Well, maybe not an accident...
[HAMILTON] Well, what do you call it?
[Burr] Well... a regime change. Caused by a bizarre and unexpected twister of fate.
[HAMILTON] You think cyclones just appear out of the blue?
[Burr] I don't know, I never really...
[HAMILTON] No, of course you never! You're too busy telling everyone how wonderful everything is!
[Burr] I'm a public figure, now. People expect me to...
[HAMILTON] Lie?
[Burr] Be encouraging! And what exactly have you been doing besides riding around on that filthy, old thing?
[HAMILTON] Well, we can't all come and go by bubble. Who's invention was that, the Wizard's? Of course, even if it wasn't I'm sure he'd still take credit for it.
[Burr] Yes, well, a lot of us are taking things that don't belong to us, aren't we?
[HAMILTON] Now wait just a clock tick! I know it may be difficult for that blissful, blonde brain of yours to comprehend that someone like him could actually choose someone like me! But it's happened... it's real. And you can wave that ridiculous wand all you want, you can't change it! He never belonged to you, he doesn't love you, and he never did! He loves me!
Glinda Slaps Her.
[HAMILTON] Cackles. Feel better now?
[Burr] Yes, I do.
[HAMILTON] Good, so do I.
She Slaps Glinda. Glinda Then Twirls Her Wand Skillfully And Elphaba Arms Herself With Her Broom. They Charge At Each Other And Then Drop Their "Weapons" And Beat Each Other Senselessly. Glinda Takes Elphaba's Hat Off Her Head And Begins To Whack Her With It. The Guards Run In.
[Guard]
 Halt! In the name of the Wizard!
They Grab Elphaba.
[HAMILTON] Stop! Let me go!
[Burr] Let me go, I almost had her!
[Guard]
 Sorry it took us so long to get here, Miss.
[HAMILTON] I can't believe you would sink this low! To use my sister's death as a trap to capture me?!
[Burr] I never meant for this to happen! Elphie!
Fiyero Swings In On A Rope.
[BURR]
 Let the green girl go!
[Burr] Fiyero, how in [Oz?
[BURR]
 I said let her go! Or explain to all Ozhow the Wizard's guards watched while Glinda the Good was slain.
[Burr] Fiyero...
[BURR]
 I said, let her go.
The Guards Release Her.
[BURR]
 Elphaba, go, now.
[HAMILTON] No, not without you.
[Burr] Fiyero, please.
[BURR]
 Hush! Now! Go!
Elphaba Hesitates.
[Burr] Do it!
She Runs Off.
[Guard]
 Seize him!
[Burr] Wait, what?! What are you doing? Stop it! In the name of goodness, stop! Don't you see? He wasn't going to harm me, he just... he just... he loves her.
[BURR]
 Glinda, I'm so sorry!
[Guard]
 Take him up to that field there! Put him on one of those poles until he tells us where the witch went.
They Drag Him Offstage.
[Burr] No, don't hurt him! Please, don't hurt him! Fiyero!!!!
[HAMILTON] Fiyero!!!!
ELEKA NAHMEN NAHMEN ATUM ATUM ELEKA NAHMEN
ELEKA NAHMEN NAHMEN ATUM ATUM ELEKA NAHMEN
LET HIS FLESH NOT BE TORN LET HIS BLOOD LEAVE NO STAIN,
WILL THEY BEAT HIM, LET HIM FEEL NO PAIN...
LET HIS BONES NEVER BREAK AND HOWEVER THEY TRY TO DESTROY HIM,
LET HIM NEVER DIE, LET HIM NEVER DIE!
ELEKA NAHMEN NAHMEN ATUM ATUM ELEKA NAHMEN
ELEKA NAHMEN NAHMEN ATUM ATUM ELEKA... ELEKA
AH! WHAT GOOD IS THIS CHANTING?
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT I'M READING
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT TRICK I OUGHT TO TRY!
FIYERO WHERE ARE YOU?! ALREADY DEAD OR BLEEDING?
ONE MORE DISASTER I CAN ADD TO MY GENEROUS SUPPLY!
NO GOOD DEED GOES UNPUNISHED
NO ACT OF CHARITY GOES UNRESENTED
NO GOOD DEED GOES UNPUNISHED
THAT'S MY NEW CREED
MY ROAD OF GOOD INTENTIONS
LED WHERE SUCH ROADS ALWAYS LEAD
NO GOOD DEED
GOES UNPUNISHED!
NESSA...
DOCTOR DILLAMOND...
FIYERO...
FIYERO!!!
ONE QUESTION HAUNTS AND HURTS
TOO MUCH, TOO MUCH TO MENTION
WAS I REALLY SEEKING GOOD
OR JUST SEEKING ATTENTION?
IS THAT ALL GOOD DEEDS ARE WHEN LOOKED AT WITH AN ICE COLD EYE?
IF THAT'S ALL GOOD DEEDS ARE
MAYBE THAT'S THE REASON WHY
NO GOOD DEED GOES UNPUNISHED
ALL HELPFUL URGES SHOULD BE CIRCUMVENTED
NO GOOD DEED GOES UNPUNISHED
SURE, I MEANT WELL, WELL LOOK AT WHAT WELL MEANT DID!
ALRIGHT, ENOUGH, SO BE IT!
SO BE IT THEN...
LET ALL OF OzBE AGREED
I'M WICKED THROUGH AND THROUGH
SINCE I COULD NOT SUCCEED
FIYERO SAVING YOU
I PROMISE NO GOOD DEED WILL I ATTEMPT TO DO AGAIN
EVER AGAIN!
NO GOOD DEAD, WILL I DO
AGAIN!!!!!!!!

[Ozia]

GO! AND HUNT HER AND FIND HER AND KILL HER!
Vicious Woman] Good fortune, witch hunters!

[Ozia]

GO! AND HUNT HER AND FIND HER AND KILL HER!
Rabid Man] Kill the witch!
[Ozia]

WICKEDNESS MUST BE PUNISHED
EVIL EFFECTIVELY ELIMINATED
WICKEDNESS MUST BE PUNISHED
KILL THE WITCH!
[Angelica]
 And, this is more than just a service to the Wizard. I have a personal score to settle with Elph... with the witch! Crowd Cheers.
IT'S DUE TO HER I'M MADE OF TIN
HER SPELL MADE THIS OCCUR
SO FOR ONCE I'M GLAD I'M HEARTLESS
I'LL BE HEARTLESS KILLING HER!
And I am not the only one. Looks Offstage. Oh, come on, you! Come out and tell them what she did to you in class that day. How you were just a cub and she cubnapped you.
Lion] No!
[Angelica]

YOU SEE THE LION ALSO
HAS A GRIEVANCE TO REPAY (Lion Roars)
IF SHE'D LET HIM FIGHT HIS OWN BATTLES WHEN HE WAS YOUNG,
HE WOULDN'T BE A COWARD TODAY!

[Burr] No, no, that's not the way it happened! Madame, you've got to stop this, it's gone too far!
[Morrible]
 Oh, I think Elphaba can take care of herself.
[Burr] Madame, something's been troubling me about Nessarose and that cyclone.
[Morrible]
 Oh yes... well, I guess it was just her time.
[Burr] Was it? Or did you...
[Morrible]
 After A Pause. Now, you listen to me, Missy, you may have fooled the rest of Ozwith this "aren't I good" routine, but you know better. You've wanted this since the beginning... and now you're getting what you wanted. So just smile and wave and shut up! Good fortune, good fortune witch hunters!
Rapid Man] Kill her!
Vicious Woman] Kill the witch!
WICKEDNESS MUST BE PUNISHED
BRAVE WITCH HUNTERS I WOULD JOIN YOU IF I COULD
BECAUSE WICKEDNESS MUST BE PUNISHED...
PUNISHED... PUNISHED...
BUT GOOD!!!
[HAMILTON] Oh, for [Oz's sake, stop crying!!! I can't listen to it anymore! Oh, you want to see your Aunt Em and your Uncle What's-his-name again?! Then get those shoes off your feet!!! Little brat... takes a dead woman's shoes; must have been raised in a barn! Chistery! Oh, Chistery, there you are. Where are the others? Chistery motions away. Chistery, please... if you don't at least try to keep speaking you will never... She Sees Glinda. Go away.
[Burr] They're coming for you.
[HAMILTON] Go away!
[Burr] Let the little girl go, and that poor little dog... Dodo.
[Burr] I know you don't want to hear this, but someone has to say it... You are out of control! I mean, come on! They're just shoes, let it go! Elphaba, you can't go on like this.
[HAMILTON] I can do anything I want. I am the Wicked Witch of the West! Another monkey Brings Her A Letter. At last! What took you so long? She Reads It. What's this? Why are you bothering me with this? She Reads On.
[Burr] What is it? What's wrong? It's Fiyero, isn't it? Is he...
[HAMILTON] We've seen his face for the last time.
[Burr] Oh no!
[HAMILTON] You're right... It's time I surrender. Carries A Bucket.
[Burr] Elphie.... Elphie, what is it?
[HAMILTON] You can't be found here! You must go. Refers To A Corner
[Burr] No.
[HAMILTON] You must leave.
[Burr] No! Elphie, I'll tell them everything.
[HAMILTON] No! They'll only turn against you.
[Burr] I don't care!
[HAMILTON] I do! Promise me, promise me, you won't try to clear my name... promise.
[Burr] Alright... I promise. But I don't understand.
[HAMILTON]
I'M LIMITED
JUST LOOK AT ME, I'M LIMITED
AND JUST LOOK AT YOU, YOU CAN DO ALL I COULDN'T DO, GLINDA

[HAMILTON] Here. Go on. Take this. Hands Her The Grimmerie.
[Burr] Elphie... you know I can't read that... Elphie...
[HAMILTON] Well then, you'll have to learn
NOW IT'S UP TO YOU
FOR BOTH OF US
NOW IT'S UP TO YOU
[HAMILTON] You're the only friend I've ever had.
[Burr] And I've had so many friends... but only one that mattered.

[Burr]
I'VE HEARD IT SAID
THAT PEOPLE COME INTO OUR LIVES FOR A REASON
BRINGING SOMETHING WE MUST LEARN
AND WE ARE LED TO THOSE
WHO HELP US MOST TO GROW
IF WE LET THEM
AND WE HELP THEM IN RETURN
WELL, I DON'T KNOW IF I BELIEVE THAT'S TRUE
BUT I KNOW I'M WHO I AM TODAY
BECAUSE I KNEW YOU
LIKE A COMMIT PULLED FROM ORBIT,
AS IT PASSES A SUN
LIKE A STREAM THAT MEETS A BOULDER
HALF WAY THROUGH THE WOOD
WHO CAN SAY IF I'VE BEEN CHANGED FOR THE BETTER?
BUT, BECAUSE I KNEW YOU...
I HAVE BEEN CHANGED
FOR GOOD...
[HAMILTON]
IT WELL MAY BE,
THAT WE WILL NEVER MEET AGAIN
IN THIS LIFETIME
SO LET ME SAY BEFORE WE PART
SO MUCH OF ME
IS MADE OF WHAT I LEARNED FROM YOU
YOU'LL BE WITH ME
LIKE A HANDPRINT ON MY HEART...
AND NOW WHATEVER WAY OUR STORIES END
I KNOW YOU HAVE RE-WRITTEN MINE
BY BEING MY FRIEND...
LIKE A SHIP BLOWN FROM IT'S MOORING
BY A WIND OFF THE SEA
LIKE A SEA DROP BY A SKY BIRD
IN A DISTANT WOOD
WHO CAN SAY IF I'VE BEEN CHANGED FOR THE BETTER?
BUT BECAUSE I KNEW YOU
[Burr]
BECAUSE I KNEW YOU
Both]
I HAVE BEEN CHANGED...
FOR GOOD...
[HAMILTON]
AND JUST TO CLEAR THE AIR
I ASK FORGIVNESS FOR THE THINGS I'VE DONE
YOU BLAME ME FOR.
[Burr]
BUT THEN I GUESS, WE KNOW THERE'S BLAME TO SHARE
Both]
AND NONE OF IT SEEMS TO MATTER ANYMORE!
[Burr] LIKE A COMET PULLED FROM ORBIT AS IT PASSES A SUN...
[HAMILTON] LIKE A SHIP BLOWN FROM ITS MOORING BY A WIND OFF THE SEA
[Burr] LIKE A STREAM THAT MEETS A BOULDER
[HAMILTON] LIKE A SEA DROP BY A BIRD
[Burr] HALFWAY THROUGH THE WOOD
[HAMILTON] IN THE WOOD
[Burr]
WHO CAN SAY IF I'VE BEEN CHANGED FOR THE BETTER?
Both]
I DO BELIEVE I HAVE BEEN CHANGED FOR THE BETTER.
[Burr]
AND, BECAUSE I KNEW YOU
[HAMILTON]
BECAUSE I KNEW YOU
Both]
BECAUSE I KNEW YOU
I HAVE BEEN CHANGED
FOR GOOD...


[HAMILTON] You have to hide. No one can know you were here. Hide yourself!
Elphaba Drapes A Scrim Around The Stage
Offstage Chorus of Women]
AND GOODNESS KNOWS
THE WICKED'S LIVES ARE LONELY
GOODNESS KNOWS THE WICKED DIE ALONE...
LAFAYETE and Other Witch Hunters Run In. You Can See The Silhouette Of The Action Happening Behind The Scrim. Glinda Is Downstage Watching The Action Take Place.
The Mob Surrounds The Witch And She Melts With A Scream The Mob Leaves And Glinda Comes Out From Hiding. She Moves Near The Scrim.
[Burr] Elphie? Elphie? Chistery opens the scrim, where just Elphaba's hat and the green bottle remain. Glinda cries, and grabs the had, holding it against her.
Chistery] Handing Her The Bottle. Miss, Miss Glinda.
[Morrible]
 Well, I don't know why you're so despondiary, I thought it went quite well! They seem thrilled to shreds with their brains and their hearts, and this and that.... Glinda Enters. Oh, Miss Glinda! I thought you'd be out festivating.
[Burr] This was Elphaba's. Holding Out The Bottle.
[Hamilton]
What's that you say?
[Burr] It was a keepsake. It was her mother's. She told me so herself.
I've only seen a little, green bottle like this one other time. It was right here, in this very room. You offered me a drink from it.
Lover's Song Played In Background.
[Hamilton]
But... oh my Lord...
I AM A SENTIMENTAL MAN
WHO ALWAYS LONGED TO BE...
a father...
[Morrible]
 So that was it. That's why she had such powers! She was a child of both worlds!
[Hamilton]
He Cries.
[Burr] I want you to leave [Oz. I'll make the pronouncement myself]
that the strains of wizardship have been too much for you and you are taking an indefinite leave of absence! Did you hear what I said?!
[Hamilton]
Yes, your goodness.
[Burr] You'd better go get your balloon ready. Guards!
He Exits.
[Morrible]
 Glinda, dear, I know we've had our miniscule differentiations in the past...
[Burr] Guards! Madame, have you ever considered how you'd fare in captivity?
[Morrible]
 What?
[Burr] Articulated. Captivity... prison! Personally, I don't think you'll hold up very well.
My professional opinion is that you do not have what it takes. I hope you prove me wrong.
I doubt you will. Take her away!
[Morrible]
 No!!!!

[Ozia]

GOOD NEWS! SHE'S DEAD!
THE WITCH OF THE WEST IS DEAD!
THE WICKEDEST WITCH THERE EVER WAS
THE ENEMY OF ALL OF US, HERE IN [Oz,
IS DEAD!
GOOD NEWS
GOOD NEWS!!!
The Scarecrow (Fiyero) Walks On Stage. He Bends Down & Knocks On A Trap Door In The Floor.
[BURR]
 It worked!
He Opens The Door & Elphaba Climbs Out.
[HAMILTON] Fiyero! I thought you'd never get here.
She Touches His Straw Face.
[BURR]
 Go ahead, touch, I don't mind. Ah, you did the best you could. You saved my life.
[HAMILTON] You're still beautiful.
[BURR]
 You don't have to lie to me.
[HAMILTON] It's not lying... its looking at things another way.
[Ozia]

NO ONE MOURNS THE WICKED
NOW AT LAST SHE'S DEAD AND GONE!
NOW AT LAST THERE'S JOY THROUGHOUT THE LAND!
[Burr] Fellow [Ozians, friends, we have been through a frightening time. There will be other times
and other things that frighten us. But if you let me, I'd like to try to help. I'd like to try to be... Glinda the Good.
[Ozia]

GOOD NEWS!!
[BURR]
 It's time to go.
[HAMILTON] We can never come back to [Oz, can we?
[BURR]
 No.
[HAMILTON] I only wish...
[BURR]
 What?
[HAMILTON] Glinda could know that we're alive.
[BURR]
 She can't know, not if we want to be safe. No one can ever know.
[Ozia]

GOOD NEWS...
[BURR]
 Come...
[Burr]
WHO CAN SAY IF I'VE BEEN CHANGED FOR THE BETTER? BUT...
Elphaba & [Burr]
BECAUSE I KNEW YOU...
[Ozia]

NO ONE MOURNS THE WICKED...
[Burr]
BECAUSE I KNEW YOU...
Elphaba & [Burr]
I HAVE BEEN CHANGED...
Fiyero and Elphaba Leave Through The Clock
[Ozia]

NO ONE MOURNS THE WICKED!
WICKED...

Aaron Burr, Sir

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[COMPANY]
1776. New York City

[HAMILTON]
Pardon me. Are you Aaron Burr, sir?

[BURR]
That depends. Who's asking?

[HAMILTON]
Oh, well, sure, sir
I'm Alexander Hamilton, I'm at your service, sir
I have been looking for you

[BURR]
I'm getting nervous

[HAMILTON]
Sir...
I heard your name at Princeton. I was seeking an accelerated course of study when I got sort of out of sorts with a buddy of yours. I may have punched him. It's a blur, sir. He handles the financials?

[BURR]
You punched the bursar

[HAMILTON]
Yes!
I wanted to do what you did. Graduate in two, then join the revolution. He looked at me like I was stupid, I'm not stupid

So how'd you do it? How'd you graduate so fast?

[BURR]
It was my parents' dying wish before they passed

[HAMILTON]
You're an orphan. Of course! I'm an orphan
God, I wish there was a war!
Then we could prove that we're worth more
Than anyone bargained for...

[BURR]
Can I buy you a drink?

[HAMILTON]
That would be nice

[BURR]
While we're talking, let me offer you some free advice
Talk less

[HAMILTON]
What?

[BURR]
Smile more

[HAMILTON]
Ha

[BURR]
Don't let them know what you're against or what you're for

[HAMILTON]
You can't be serious

[BURR]
You wanna get ahead?

[HAMILTON]
Yes

[BURR]
Fools who run their mouths off wind up dead

[LAURE]

Yo yo yo yo yo!
What time is it?

[LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
Show time!

[BURR]
...like I said...

[LAURE]

Show time! Show time! Yo!
I'm John Laurens in the place to be!
Two pints o' Sam Adams, but I'm workin' on three, uh!
Those redcoats don't want it with me!
Cuz I will pop chick-a pop these cops till I'm free!

[LAFAYETTE]
Oui oui, mon ami, je m'appelle Lafayette!
The Lancelot of the revolutionary set!
I came from afar just to say "Bonsoir!"
Tell the King "Casse toi!" Who's the best?
C'est moi!

[MULLIGAN]
Brrrah brraaah! I am Hercules Mulligan
Up in it, lovin' it, yes I heard ya mother said "Come again?"
Lock up ya daughters and horses, of course
It's hard to have intercourse over four sets of corsets...

[LAURE]

No more sex, pour me another brew, son!
Let's raise a couple more...

[LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
To the revolution!

[LAURE]

Well, if it ain't the prodigy of Princeton college!

[MULLIGAN]
Aaron Burr!

[LAURE]

Give us a verse, drop some knowledge!

[BURR]
Good luck with that] you're takin' a stand
You spit. I'm ‘a sit. We'll see where we land

[LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
Boooo!

[LAURE]

Burr, the revolution's imminent. What do you stall for?

[HAMILTON]
If you stand for nothing, Burr, what'll you fall for?
[LAURE]

Ooh
Who are you? [MULLIGAN]
Ooh

Who are you? [LAFAYETTE]
Ooh

Who are you?

My Shot

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[HAMILTON]
I am not throwing away my shot!
I am not throwing away my shot!
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot!
I'm ‘a get a scholarship to King's College
I prob'ly shouldn't brag, but dag, I amaze and astonish
The problem is I got a lot of brains but no polish
I gotta holler just to be heard
With every word, I drop knowledge!
I'm a diamond in the rough, a shiny piece of coal
Tryin' to reach my goal. My power of speech] unimpeachable
Only nineteen but my mind is older
These New York City streets get colder, I shoulder
Ev'ry burden, ev'ry disadvantage
I have learned to manage, I don't have a gun to brandish
I walk these streets famished
The plan is to fan this spark into a flame
But damn, it's getting dark, so let me spell out the name
I am the-

[HAMILTON/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN/LAURE]

A-L-E-X-A-N-D
E-R-we are-meant to be...

[HAMILTON]
A colony that runs independently
Meanwhile, Britain keeps shittin' on us endlessly
Essentially, they tax us relentlessly
Then King George turns around, runs a spending spree
He ain't ever gonna set his descendants free
So there will be a revolution in this century
Enter me!

[LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN/LAURE]

(He says in parentheses)

[HAMILTON]
Don't be shocked when your hist'ry book mentions me
I will lay down my life if it sets us free
Eventually, you'll see my ascendancy
[HAMILTON]
And I am not throwing away
My shot
I am not throwing away
My shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot
[LAURE]

My shot!

My shot!

And I'm not throwing away my shot.

[HAMILTON/MULLIGAN/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE]
I am not throwing away my shot
I am not throwing away my shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot
It's time to take a shot!

[LAFAYETTE]
I dream of life without a monarchy
The unrest in France will lead to ‘onarchy?
‘Onarchy? How you say, how you say, ‘anarchy?'
When I fight, I make the other side panicky
With my-

[HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
Shot!

[MULLIGAN]
Yo, I'm a tailor's apprentice
And I got y'all knuckleheads in loco parentis
I'm joining the rebellion cuz I know it's my chance
To socially advance, instead of sewin' some pants!
I'm gonna take a-

[HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
Shot!

[LAURE]

But we'll never be truly free
Until those in bondage have the same rights as you and me
You and I. Do or die. Wait till I sally in
On a stallion with the first black battalion
Have another-

[HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
Shot!

[BURR]
Geniuses, lower your voices
You keep out of trouble and you double your choices
I'm with you, but the situation is fraught
You've got to be carefully taught]
If you talk, you're gonna get shot!

[HAMILTON]
Burr, check what we got
Mister Lafayette, hard rock like Lancelot
I think your pants look hot
Laurens, I like you a lot
Let's hatch a plot blacker than the kettle callin' the pot...
What are the odds the gods would put us all in one spot
Poppin' a squat on conventional wisdom, like it or not
A bunch of revolutionary manumission abolitionists?
Give me a position, show me where the ammunition is!

Oh, am I talkin' too loud?
Sometimes I get over excited, shoot off at the mouth
I never had a group of friends before
I promise that I'll make y'all proud

[LAURE]

Let's get this guy in front of a crowd

[HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN/ENSEMBLE]
I am not throwing away my shot
I am not throwing away my shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country

I imagine death so much it feels more like a memory
When's it gonna get me?
In my sleep? Seven feet ahead of me?
If I see it comin', do I run or do I let it be?
Is it like a beat without a melody?
See, I never thought I'd live past twenty
Where I come from some get half as many
Ask anybody why we livin' fast and we laugh, reach for a flask
We have to make this moment last, that's plenty

Scratch that
This is not a moment, it's the movement
Where all the hungriest brothers with
Something to prove went?
Foes oppose us, we take an honest stand
We roll like Moses, claimin' our promised land
And? If we win our independence?
‘Zat a guarantee of freedom for our descendants?
Or will the blood we shed begin an endless
Cycle of vengeance and death with no defendants?
I know the action in the street is excitin'
But Jesus, between all the bleedin' ‘n fightin'
I've been readin' ‘n writin'
We need to handle our financial situation
Are we a nation of states? What's the state of our nation?
I'm past patiently waitin'. I'm passionately
Smashin' every expectation
Every action's an act of creation!
I'm laughin' in the face of casualties and sorrow
For the first time, I'm thinkin' past tomorrow

Farmer Refuted

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[SEABURY]
Hear ye, hear ye! My name is Samuel Seabury
And I present "Free Thoughts on the
Proceedings of the Continental Congress!"
Heed not the rabble who scream revolution
They have not your interests at heart

[MULLIGAN]
Oh my God. Tear this dude apart

[SEABURY]
Chaos and bloodshed are not a solution
Don't let them lead you astray
This Congress does not speak for me

[BURR]
Let him be

[SEABURY]
They're playing a dangerous game
I pray the king shows you his mercy
For shame, for shame...
[HAMILTON]
Yo!
He'd have you all unravel at the
Sound of screams but the
Revolution is comin'
The have-nots are gonna
Win this
It's hard to listen to you with a straight face

Chaos and bloodshed already haunt us, honestly you shouldn't even talk. And what about Boston? Look at the cost, n' all that we've lost n' you talk
About Congress?!

My dog speaks more eloquently than thee!

But strangely, your mange is the same

Is he in Jersey?

For the revolution!
[SEABURY]
Heed not the rabble
Who scream
Revolution, they
Have not your
Interests
At heart

Chaos and bloodshed are
Not a
Solution. Don't
Let them lead you
Astray
This Congress does not
Speak for me

They're playing a dangerous game

I pray the king shows you his mercy

For shame

For shame,

[COMPANY]
For the revolution!

[SEABURY]
Heed-

[HAMILTON]
If you repeat yourself again I'm gonna-

[SEABURY/HAMILTON]
Scream-

[HAMILTON]
Honestly, look at me, please don't read!

[SEABURY]
Not your interests-

[HAMILTON]
Don't modulate the key then not debate with me!
Why should a tiny island across the sea regulate the price of tea?

[BURR]
Alexander, please!

You'll Be Back

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[KING GEORGE]
You say
The price of my love's not a price that you're willing to pay
You cry
In your tea which you hurl in the sea when you see me go by
Why so sad?
Remember we made an arrangement when you went away
Now you're making me mad
Remember, despite our estrangement, I'm your man
You'll be back
Soon you'll see
You'll remember you belong to me
You'll be back
Time will tell
You'll remember that I served you well
Oceans rise
Empires fall
We have seen each other through it all
And when push
Comes to shove
I will send a fully armed battalion
To remind you of my love!

Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da
Da da dat dat da ya da!
Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da
Da da dat dat da...

You say our love is draining and you can't go on
You'll be the one complaining when I am gone...
And no, don't change the subject
Cuz you're my favorite subject
My sweet, submissive subject
My loyal, royal subject
Forever and ever and ever and ever and ever...

You'll be back
Like before
I will fight the fight and win the war
For your love
For your praise
And I'll love you till my dying days
When you're gone
I'll go mad
So don't throw away this thing we had

Cuz when push comes to shove
I will kill your friends and family to remind you of my love
Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da
Da da dat dat da ya da!
Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da
Da da dat-
Everybody!

[ENSEMBLE]
Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da

[WASHINGTON]
Check it-
Can I be real a second?
For just a millisecond?
Let down my guard and tell the people how I feel a second?
Now I'm the model of a modern major general
The venerated Virginian veteran whose men are all
Lining up, to put me up on a pedestal
Writin' letters to relatives
Embellishin' my elegance and eloquence
But the elephant is in the room
The truth is in ya face when ya hear the British cannons go...

[ENSEMBLE]
Boom!

[WASHINGTON]
Any hope of success is fleeting
How can I keep leading when the people I'm
Leading keep retreating?
We put a stop to the bleeding as the British take Brooklyn
Knight takes rook, but look

Outmanned

Outnumbered

[WASHINGTON]
We gotta run to Harlem quick, we can't afford another slip
Guns and horses giddyup
I decide to divvy up
My forces, they're skittish as the British cut the city up
This close to giving up, facing mad scrutiny
I scream in the face of this mass mutiny]
Are these the men with which I am to defend America?
We ride at midnight, Manhattan in the distance
I cannot be everywhere at once, people
I'm in dire need of assistance...

[BURR]
Your excellency, sir!

[WASHINGTON]
Who are you?

[BURR]
Aaron Burr, Sir?
Permission to state my case?

[WASHINGTON]
As you were

[BURR]
Sir
I was a captain under General Montgomery
Until he caught a bullet in the neck in Quebec
And well, in summary
I think that I could be of some assistance
I admire how you keep firing on the British
From a distance

[WASHINGTON]
Huh

[BURR]
I have some questions, a couple of suggestions on how to fight instead of fleeing west

[WASHINGTON]
Yes?

[BURR]
Well-

Your excellency, you wanted to see me?

Hamilton, come in, have you met Burr?

Sir?

Close the door on your way out

[HAMILTON]
Have I done something wrong, sir?

[WASHINGTON]
On the contrary
I called you here because our odds are beyond scary
Your reputation precedes you, but I have to laugh

[HAMILTON]
Sir?

[WASHINGTON]
Hamilton, how come no one can get you on their staff?

[HAMILTON]
Sir!

[WASHINGTON]
Don't get me wrong, you're a young man, of great renown
I know you stole British cannons when we were still downtown
Nathaniel Green and Henry Knox wanted to hire you...

[HAMILTON]
To be their Secretary? I don't think so

[WASHINGTON]
Why're you upset?

[HAMILTON]
I'm not-

[WASHINGTON]
It's alright, you want to fight, you've got a hunger
I was just like you when I was younger
Head full of fantasies of dyin' like a martyr?

[HAMILTON]
Yes

[WASHINGTON]
Dying is easy, young man. Living is harder

[HAMILTON]
Why are you telling me this?

[WASHINGTON]
I'm being honest
I'm working with a third of what our Congress has promised
We are a powder keg about to explode
I need someone like you to lighten the load. So?

[COMPANY (EXCEPT HAMILTON)]
I am not throwin' away my shot!
I am not throwin' away my shot!

You need all the help you can get
I have some friends. Laurens, Mulligan
Marquis de Lafayette, okay, what else?

[WASHINGTON AND COMPANY]
Outnumbered, outplanned!

[HAMILTON]
We'll need some spies on the inside
Some King's men who might let some things slide
[HAMILTON]
I'll write to Congress and tell ‘em we need supplies, you rally the guys, master the element of surprise

I'll rise above my station, organize your information, ‘til we rise to the occasion of our new nation. Sir!

A Winter's Ball

How does the bastard, orphan, son of a whore
Go on and on
Grow into more of a phenomenon?
Watch this obnoxious, arrogant, loudmouth bother
Be seated at the right hand of the father
Washington hires Hamilton right on sight
But Hamilton still wants to fight, not write
Now Hamilton's skill with a quill is undeniable
But what do we have in common? We're
Reliable with the

We were at a revel with some rebels on a hot night

Everybody's dancin' and the band's top volume

Grab my sister, and
Whisper, "Yo, this
One's mine."

My sister made her way across the room to you
And I got nervous, thinking "What's she gonna do?"
She grabbed you by the arm, I'm thinkin' "I'm through"
Then you look back at me and suddenly I'm
Helpless!

Oh, look at those eyes

Oh!
Yeah, I'm
Helpless, I know

I'm so into you
I am so into you

I know I'm down for the count
And I'm drownin' in ‘em.

[ALL WOMEN]
Oooh

Oooh

Oooh

Oooh

Helpless!

Look into your eyes
And the sky's the limit
I'm
Helpless!
Down for the count
And I'm drownin' in ‘em

I'm helpless!

Look into your eyes
And the sky's the limit I'm helpless!

Down for the count
And I'm drownin' in ‘em.

[HAMILTON]
Where are you taking me?

[ANGELICA]
I'm about to change your life

[HAMILTON]
Then by all means, lead the way

[ELIZA]
Elizabeth Schuyler. It's a pleasure to meet you

[HAMILTON]
Schuyler?

[ANGELICA]
My sister

[ELIZA]
Thank you for all your service

[HAMILTON]
If it takes fighting a war for us to meet, it will have been worth it

[ANGELICA]
I'll leave you to it

[ELIZA AND WOMEN]
One week later

[ELIZA]
I'm writin' a letter nightly
Now my life gets better, every letter that you write me
Laughin' at my sister, cuz she wants to form a harem

[ANGELICA]
I'm just sayin', if you really loved me, you would share him
[ELIZA]
Ha!
Two weeks later
In the living room stressin'
My father's stone-faced
While you're asking for his blessin'
I'm dying inside, as
You wine
And dine
And I'm tryin' not to cry
‘cause there's nothing that your mind can't do
My father makes his way across the room
To you
I panic for a second, thinking
"we're through"
But then he shakes your hand and says
"Be true"
And you turn back to me, smiling, and I'm
Helpless!

Helpless!
Hoo!

That boy is mine
That boy is mine!

Helpless! Helpless!
Down for the count
And I'm drownin' in em

[ALL WOMEN]
Stressin'

Blessin'

Oooh

Oooh

Oooh

Oooh

Helpless!
Look into your eyes
And the sky's the
Limit I'm
Helpless!
Down for the count
And I'm drownin' in
‘em I'm
Helpless!

Look into your eyes
And the sky's the
Limit I'm
Helpless!
Down for the count
And I'm drownin' in em

[HAMILTON]
Eliza, I don't have a dollar to my name
An acre of land, a troop to command, a dollop of fame
All I have's my honor, a tolerance for pain
A couple of college credits and my top-notch brain
Insane, your family brings out a different side of me
Peggy confides in me, Angelica tried to take a bite of me
No stress, my love for you is never in doubt
We'll get a little place in Harlem and we'll figure it out
I've been livin' without a family since I was a child
My father left, my mother died, I grew up buckwild
But I'll never forget my mother's face, that was real
And long as I'm alive, Eliza, swear to God
You'll never feel so...

[HAMILTON]
Eliza...

I've never felt so-

My life is gon' be fine cuz Eliza's in it.
[ELIZA]
I do I do I do I do!

I do I do I do I do!

Hey, yeah, yeah!

I'm down for the count
I'm-

I look into your eyes, and the sky's the limit
I'm

...drownin' in ‘em. [ALL WOMEN]
Helpless!

Helpless!

Helpless!

Down for the count
And I'm drownin' in ‘em

Helpless!

Helpless!

Helpless!

Down for the count
And I'm drownin' in ‘em.

Satisfied

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[LAURE]

Alright, alright. That's what I'm talkin' about!
Now everyone give it up for the maid of honor
Angelica Schuyler!
[ANGELICA]
A toast to the groom!

To the bride!

From your sister

Who is always by your side

To your union

And the hope that you provide

May you always...

Be satisfied.

[ALL MEN]
To the groom!
To the groom!
To the groom!

To the bride!
To the bride!

Angelica!
Angelica!
Angelica!

By your side!

To the union!
To the revolution!

You provide!
You provide!

[HAMILTON AND MEN]
Always-

Rewind-

[ALL WOMEN]
To the groom!

To the bride!

To the bride!

[ELIZA AND WOMEN]
Angelica!

By your side!

To the union!
To the revolution!

You provide!

Always-

Rewind-

[ANGELICA]
I remember that night, I just might
Regret that night for the rest of my days

I remember those soldier boys
Tripping over themselves to win our praise

I remember that dreamlike candlelight
Like a dream that you can't quite place

But Alexander, I'll never forget the first
Time I saw your face

I have never been the same
Intelligent eyes in a hunger-pang frame
And when you said "Hi," I forgot my dang name
Set my heart aflame, ev'ry part aflame

[FULL COMPANY]
This is not a game...

[HAMILTON]
You strike me as a woman who has never been satisfied

[ANGELICA]
I'm sure I don't know what you mean. You forget yourself

[HAMILTON]
You're like me. I'm never satisfied

[ANGELICA]
Is that right?

[HAMILTON]
I have never been satisfied

[ANGELICA]
My name is Angelica Schuyler

[HAMILTON]
Alexander Hamilton

[ANGELICA]
Where's your fam'ly from?

[HAMILTON]
Unimportant. There's a million things I haven't done but
Just you wait, just you wait...

[ANGELICA]
So so so-
So this is what it feels like to match wits
With someone at your level! What the hell is the catch? It's
The feeling of freedom, of seein' the light
It's Ben Franklin with a key and a kite! You see it, right?
The conversation lasted two minutes, maybe three minutes
Ev'rything we said in total agreement, it's
A dream and it's a bit of a dance
A bit of a posture, it's a bit of a stance. He's a
Bit of a flirt, but I'm ‘a give it a chance
I asked about his fam'ly, did you see his answer?
His hands started fidgeting, he looked askance?
He's penniless, he's flying by the seat of his pants

Handsome, boy, does he know it!
Peach fuzz, and he can't even grow it!
I wanna take him far away from this place
Then I turn and see my sister's face and she is...

[ELIZA]
Helpless...

[ANGELICA]
And I know she is...

[ELIZA]
Helpless...

[ANGELICA]
And her eyes are just...

[ELIZA]
Helpless...

[ANGELICA]
And I realize

[ANGELICA AND COMPANY]
Three fundamental truths at the exact same time...

[HAMILTON]
Where are you taking me?

[ANGELICA]
I'm about to change your life

[HAMILTON]
Then by all means, lead the way

[COMPANY (EXCEPT ANGELICA)]
Number one!

[ANGELICA]
I'm a girl in a world in which
My only job is to marry rich
My father has no sons so I'm the one
Who has to social climb for one
So I'm the oldest and the wittiest and the gossip in
New York City is insidious
Alexander is penniless
Ha! That doesn't mean I want him any less

[ELIZA]
Elizabeth Schuyler. It's a pleasure to meet you

[HAMILTON]
Schuyler?

[ANGELICA]
My sister

[COMPANY]
Number two!

[ANGELICA]
He's after me cuz I'm a Schuyler sister
That elevates his status, I'd
Have to be naïve to set that aside
Maybe that is why I introduce him to Eliza
Now that's his bride
Nice going, Angelica, he was right
You will never be satisfied

[ELIZA]
Thank you for all your service

[HAMILTON]
If it takes fighting a war for us to meet, it will have been worth it

[ANGELICA]
I'll leave you to it

[COMPANY]
Number three!

[ANGELICA]
I know my sister like I know my own mind
You will never find anyone as trusting or as kind
If I tell her that I love him she'd be silently resigned
He'd be mine
She would say, "I'm fine"

[ANGELICA AND COMPANY]
She'd be lying

[ANGELICA]
But when I fantasize at night
It's Alexander's eyes
As I romanticize what might
Have been if I hadn't sized him
Up so quickly
At least my dear Eliza's his wife;
At least I keep his eyes in my life...
[ANGELICA]
To the groom!

To the bride!

From your sister

Who is always by your side

To your union

And the hope that you provide

May you always

Be satisfied

And I know

She'll be happy as

His bride
And I know [ALL MEN (EXCEPT HAMILTON)]
To the groom!
To the groom!
To the groom!

To the bride!
To the bride!

Angelica!
Angelica!

By your side

To the union!
To the revolution!

You provide!
You provide!

[HAMILTON AND MEN]
Always-

Be satisfied

Be satisfied

[MEN]
Be satisfied
Be satisfied
Be satisfied
Be satisfied

Be satisfied
Be satisfied

Be satisfied
Be satisfied
Be satisfied
Be satisfied.

[ALL WOMEN (EXCEPT ELIZA)]
To the groom!

To the bride!

To the bride!

[ELIZA AND WOMEN]
Angelica!

By your side

To the union!
To the revolution!

You provide!

Always-

Be satisfied

[WOMEN]
Be satisfied

Be satisfied

Be satisfied.

[ANGELICA]
He will never be satisfied
I will never be satisfied

The Story of Tonight (Reprise)

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[LAURE]

I may not live to see our glory!

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE]
I may not live to see our glory!

[LAURE]

But I've seen wonders great and small

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE]
I've seen wonders great and small

[LAURE]

‘Cause if the tomcat can get married

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE]
If Alexander can get married-

[LAURE]

There's hope for our ass, after all!

[LAFAYETTE]
Raise a glass to freedom

[LAURENS/MULLIGAN]
Hey!
Something you will never see again!

[MULLIGAN]
No matter what she tells you

[LAFAYETTE]
Let's have another round tonight!

[LAURE]

Raise a glass to the four of us!

[LAFAYETTE/HAMILTON]
Ho!

[MULLIGAN]
To the newly not poor of us!

[LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/HAMILTON]
Woo!

[LAFAYETTE]
We'll tell the story of tonight

[LAURE]

Let's have another round-

[HAMILTON]
Well, if it isn't Aaron Burr

[BURR]
Sir!

[HAMILTON]
I didn't think that you would make it

[BURR]
To be sure

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE]
Burr!

[BURR]
I came to say congratulations

[MULLIGAN]
Spit a verse, Burr!

[BURR]
I see the whole gang is here

[LAFAYETTE]
You are the worst, Burr!

[HAMILTON]
Ignore them. Congrats to you, Lieutenant Colonel
I wish I had your command instead of manning George's journal

[BURR]
No, you don't

[HAMILTON]
Yes, I do

[BURR]
Now, be sensible
From what I hear, you've made yourself indispensable

[LAURE]

Well, well, I heard
You've got a special someone on the side, Burr

[HAMILTON]
Is that so?

[LAURE]

What are you tryin' to hide, Burr?

[BURR]
I should go

[HAMILTON]
No, these guys should go

[LAFAYETTE]
What?

[LAURE]

No!

[HAMILTON]
Leave us alone

[MULLIGAN]
Man...

[HAMILTON]
It's alright, Burr. I wish you'd brought this girl with you tonight, Burr

[BURR]
You're very kind, but I'm afraid it's unlawful, sir

[HAMILTON]
What do you mean?

[BURR]
She's married

[HAMILTON]
I see

[BURR]
She's married to a British officer

[HAMILTON]
Oh shit...

[BURR]
Congrats again, Alexander. Smile more
I'll see you on the other side of the war

[HAMILTON]
I will never understand you
If you love this woman, go get her! What are you waiting for?

[BURR]
I'll see you on the other side of the war

[HAMILTON]
I'll see you on the other side of the war

Wait For It

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[BURR]
Theodosia writes me a letter everyday
I'm keeping the bed warm while her husband is away
He's on the British side in Georgia
He's trying to keep the colonies in line
But he can keep all of Georgia
Theodosia, she's mine

Love doesn't discriminate
Between the sinners
And the saints
It takes and it takes and it takes
And we keep loving anyway
We laugh and we cry
And we break
And we make our mistakes
And if there's a reason I'm by her side
When so many have tried
Then I'm willing to wait for it
I'm willing to wait for it
[BURR]
My grandfather was a fire and brimstone preacher

But there are things that the
Homilies and hymns won't teach ya

My mother was a genius

My father commanded respect

When they died they left no instructions
Just a legacy to protect

[MEN]
Preacher, preacher
Preacher

Teach ya, teach ya, teach ya

Respect, respect

[WOMEN]
Genius


[LAURE]

GOOD NEWS, SHE'S DEAD!
THE WITCH OF THE WEST IS DEAD!
THE WICKEDEST WITCH THERE EVER WAS,
THE ENEMY OF ALL OF US HERE IN [,
IS DEAD! GOOD NEWS! GOOD NEWS!

[LAURE]

Look, it's Glinda!


[LAURE]

floats in on a giant bubble

[LAURE]

 It's good to see me, isn't it? ([Ozians Agree) No need to respond that was rhetorical. Fellow [Ozia]


[BURR]
LET US BE GLAD,
LET US BE GRATEFUL,
LET US REJOICIFY THAT GOODNESS COULD SUBDUE
THE WICKED WORKINGS OF YOU KNOW WHO!
ISN'T IT NICE TO KNOW
THAT GOOD WILL CONQUER EVIL?
THE TRUTH WE ALL BELIEVE'LL BY AND BY
OUTLIVE A LIE
FOR YOU AND...

[BURR]
Glinda! Exactly how dead is she?

[[Burr] Well, there has been much rumor and speculation... innuendo, outuendo...
but let me set the record straight. According to the Time Dragon Clock, the melting occurred at the 13th hour;
a direct result of a bucket of water thrown by a female child. Yes, the Wicked Witch of the West is dead!

[Ozian]
NO ONE MOURNS THE WICKED!

[Ozian]
NO ONE CRIES THEY WON'T RETURN!

[Ozia]

NO ONE LAYS A LILY ON THEIR GRAVE!
[Ozian Man]
THE GOOD MAN SCORNS THE WICKED!
Women]
THROUGH THEIR LIVES OUR CHILDREN LEARN!

[Ozia]

WHAT WE MISS WHEN WE MISBEHAVE!
[Burr]
AND GOODNESS KNOWS
THE WICKEDS' LIVES ARE LONELY
GOODNESS KNOWS
THE WICKED DIE ALONE
IT JUST SHOWS WHEN YOU'RE WICKED
YOU'RE LEFT ONLY
ON YOUR OWN
[Ozia]

YES, GOODNESS KNOWS
THE WICKEDS' LIVES ARE LONELY
GOODNESS KNOWS
THE WICKED CRY ALONE
NOTHING GROWS FOR THE WICKED
THEY REAP ONLY
WHAT THEY'VE SEWN
[Ozian] Glinda, why does wickedness happen?
[Burr] That's a good question; one that many people find confusifying. Are people born wicked,
or do they have wickedness thrust upon them? After all, she had a childhood,;
She had a father, who just happed to be the governor of munchlinkland Witch's Parents Enter.

[Frex]
 I'm off to the assembly, dear.
[Burr] She had a mother, as so many do...
[Frex]

HOW I HATE TO GO AND LEAVE YOU LONELY
Melena]
THAT'S ALRIGH IT'S ONLY JUST ONE NIGHT
[Frex]

BUT KNOW THAT YOU'RE HERE, IN MY HEART
WHILE I'M OUT OF YOUR SIGHT!
Frex Exits. A Lover Runs Into The Room.
[Burr] And like all families, they had their secrets.
Lover]
HAVE ANOTHER DRINK, MY DARK EYED BEAUTY,
I'VE GOT ONE MORE NIGHT LEFT HERE IN TOWN,
SO HAVE ANOTHER DRINK OF GREEN ELIXER
AND WE'LL HAVE OURSELVES A LITTLE MIXER
HAVE ANOTHER LITTLE SWALLOW LITTLE LADY,
AND FOLLOW ME DOWN
[Burr] And of course, from the moment she was born she was... well... different!
Midwife] AHHH!! It's coming!
[Frex]
 Now?
Midwife] The baby's coming!
[Frex]
 And how!

Midwife]
I SEE A NOSE!
[Frex]

I SEE A CURL!
Both]
IT'S A HEALTHY, PERFECT, LOVELY LITTLE...
(They Scream)
Melena] What is it? What's wrong?
Midwife]
HOW CAN IT BE?
[Frex]

WHAT DOES IT MEAN?
Midwife]
IT'S ATTROCIOUS!
[Frex]

IT'S OBSCENE!
Both]
LIKE A FROGGY, FERNY CABBAGE,
THE BABY IS UNATURALLY
GREEN!!!
[Frex]
 Take it away... Take it away!!!!
[Burr] So you see, it couldn't have been easy!

Munchki]

NO ONE MOURNS THE WICKED!
NOW AT LAST, SHE'S DEAD AND GONE!
NOW AT LAST THERE'S JOY THROUGHOUT THE LAND!
AND GOODNESS KNOWS (GOODNESS KNOWS)
WE KNOW WHAT GOODNESS IS (OOOOHHHH)
GOODNESS KNOWS, THE WICKED DIE ALONE (SHE DIED ALONE)
WOE TO THOSE (WOE TO THOSE)
WHO SPURN WHAT GOODNESSES THEY ARE SHOWN!
NO ONE MOURNS THE WICKED (GOOD NEWS)
NO ONE MOURNS THE WICKED (GOOD NEWS)
NO ONE MOURNS... THE WICKED...
WICKED...
WICKED!!!!!
[Burr] Well, this has been fun! But as you can imagine I have much to attend to,
what with the Wizard's unexpected departure. So, if there are no further questions...
[Ozian] Glinda, is it true you were her friend?
[Ozians Gasp
[Burr] Well, I... you see... um... yes.
Louder Gasps
[Burr] Well, it depends on what you mean by "friend". She Motions Her Bubble Downward.
I did know her. That is, our paths did cross... at school. But you must understand, it was a long time ago and we were both very young.

[Students]

O, HALLOWED HALLS AND VINE DRAPED WALLS
THE PROUDLIEST SITE THERE IS.
WHEN GREY AND SEER OUR HAIR HATH TURNED,
WE SHALL STILL REVERE THE LESSONS LEARNED

Frex Wheels Nessarose On Stage.
[HAMILTON]
 What?! What are you looking at? Oh, do I have something in my teeth?
Okay, let's get this over with. No, I'm not seasick, yes, I've always been green, no, I didn't chew grass as a child.
[Frex]
 Elphaba!
[HAMILTON] Oh, this is my younger sister, Nessarose. As you can see, she is a perfectly normal color.
[Frex]
 Elphaba, stop making a spectacle of yourself! I'm only sending you here for one reason...
[HAMILTON] Yes, I know, to look after Nessarose.
Frex Holds Out A Box.
[Frex]
 My precious little girl] a parting gift.
[Angelica]
 Now, father... He Pulls Silver Shoes From The Box. Jeweled shoes!
[Frex]
 As befits the future governor of Munchkinland. Elphaba, take care of your sister.
And try not to talk so much! He Kisses Nessarose And Exits.
[Angelica]
 Elphaba...
[HAMILTON] Well what could he have gotten me? I clash with everything!
Mme. Morrible Enters
[Morrible]
 Welcome, new students! I am Madame Morrible, headmistress here, at Shiz University.
And whether you're here to study logic, literature, or linguification,
I know I speak for my fellow faculty members when I say we have nothing but the highest hopes for some of you.
Now, regarding room assignments... Elphaba & Galinda Raise Their Hands.
She Notices Galinda First. Yes, is this regarding room assignments?
[linda]

 Oh, Madame, thank you for asking, but I've already been assigned a private suite...
Noticing Her Followers' Disappointment. But you can all come visit me whenever you want!
Shen Shen] How good of you!
Pfanee] You are so good!
[linda]

 No I'm not!
Both] Yes you are!
[linda]

 Now stop! Swishes Her Hair.
[Morrible]
 Do you have a question?

[linda]

 Yes, you see, I am Galinda Upland of the Upperuplands... I've applied to your sorcery seminar,
and indeed that is my sole purpose of attending Shiz; to study sorcery with you.
Perhaps you recall my essay, "Magic Wands, Need They Have A Point".
[Morrible]
 Yes... However, I do not teach my seminar every semester, unless, of course, somebody special were to come along.
[linda]

 Well, exactly!
[HAMILTON] We have not yet received our room assignments.
[Morrible]
 Yes, yes, of course! Oh, You must be Miss Nessarose, the governor's daughter.
What a tragically beautiful face you have! Sees Elphaba, snorts...And you must be.
[HAMILTON] I'm the other daughter. Elphaba. I'm beautifully tragic.
[Morrible]
 Yes, yes, I'm sure you're very bright.
[linda]

 Bright? She's phosphorescent.
[Morrible]
 I don't seem to have you on my list. Oh, well a slight gulch, but not to fret! We'll find someplace to put you.
[linda]

 Y'know, I don't even think she read my essay.
Shen Shen] That's so unfair!
[Angelica]
 You should say something!
[linda]

 Should I?
Pfanee] Do it!
[Morrible]
 Now, which one of you young ladies would like to volunteer to share with Miss Elphaba?
[linda]

 Madame Morrible...
[Morrible]
 Thank you dear. Oh, how very good of you!
[linda]

 What?
[Morrible]
 Miss Elphaba, you may share with Miss Galinda.
[linda]

 Huh?
[Morrible]
 The governor made his concern for your sister's well being quite clear.
So, I thought it would be best if she share my private compartment where I can assist her as needed...
[HAMILTON] But Madame, I've always looked after my sister.
[Morrible]
 Everyone, to your dormitories.
[HAMILTON] But Madame...
[HAMILTON] Let her go!!!
Nessarose's Wheelchair Is Torn From Morrible's Hands And Begins To Wheel Itself Back To Elphaba.
[Morrible]
 How did you do that?
[linda]

 How did she do that?
[Angelica]
 Elphaba!
[Morrible]
 You mean this has happened before?
[HAMILTON] Uh... Something just comes over me sometimes... I'm sorry, Madame.
[Morrible]
 What? Never apologize for talent! Talent is a gift! Have you ever considered a career in sorcery?
[HAMILTON] Sorcery?
[Morrible]
 I shall tutor you myself, and take no other students.
[linda]

 What?
All Students But Galinda Exit.
[Morrible]
 Oh, Miss Elphaba...
MANY YEARS I HAVE WAITED
FOR A GIFT LIKE YOURS TO APPEAR
WHY I PREDICT THE WIZARD COULD MAKE YOU HIS
MAGIC, GRAND VIZIER!
MY DEAR, MY DEAR,
I'LL WRITE AT ONCE TO THE WIZARD
TELL HIM OF YOU IN ADVANCE
WITH A TALENT LIKE YOURS, DEAR, THERE IS
A DEFIN-ISH CHANCE
IF YOU WORK AS YOU SHOULD
YOU'LL BE MAKING GOOD
[linda]

 Madame Morrible...
[Morrible]
 No, not now dearest. She Exits.
[Burr] This will just make me a better person. She simles.
She Runs Off.

[HAMILTON]
DID THAT REALLY JUST HAPPEN?
HAVE I ACTUALLY UNDERSTOOD?
THIS WEIRD QUIRK I'VE TRIED TO SURPRESS OR HIDE
IS A TALENT THAT COULD HELP ME MEET THE WIZARD
IF I MAKE GOOD
SO I'LL MAKE GOOD.
WHEN I MEET THE WIZARD,
ONCE I PROVE MY WORTH,
AND THEN I MEET THE WIZARD,
WHAT I'VE WAITED FOR SINCE
SINCE BIRTH!
AND WITH ALL HIS WIZARD WISDOM
BY MY LOOKS HE WON'T BE BLINDED
DO YOU THINK THE WIZARD IS DUMB?
OR LIKE MUNCHKINS SO SMALL-MINDED? NO!
HE'LL SAY TO ME "I SEE WHO YOU TRULY ARE,
A GIRL ON WHOM I CAN RELY"
AND THAT'S HOW WE'LL BEGIN,
THE WIZARD AND I
ONCE I'M WITH THE WIZARD,
MY WHOLE LIFE WILL CHANGE,
'CUZ ONCE YOU'RE WITH THE WIZARD
NO ONE THINKS YOU'RE STRANGE
NO FATHER IS NOT PROUD OF YOU,
NO SISTER ACTS ASHAMED,
AND ALL OF OzHAS TO LOVE YOU
WHEN BY THE WIZARD YOU'RE ACLAIMED
AND THIS GIFT OR THIS CURSE
THAT I HAVE INSIDE
MAYBE AT LAST I'LL KNOW WHY
WHEN WE ARE HAND IN HAND,
THE WIZARD AND I
AND ONE DAY HE'LL SAY TO ME, "ELPHABA,
A GIRL WHO IS SO SUPERIOR,
SHOULDN'T A GIRL WHO'S SO GOOD INSIDE
HAVE A MATCHING EXTERIOR?
AND SINCE FOLKS HERE TO AN OBSURED DEGREE
SEEM FIXATED ON YOUR VERDEGRIS
WOULD IT BE ALRIGHT BY YOU
IF I DEGREENIFY YOU?"
AND OF COURSE THAT'S NOT IMPORTANT TO ME
"ALRIGHT! WHY NOT?" I'LL REPLY
OH, WHAT A PAIR WE'LL BE
THE WIZARD AND I
YES, WHAT A PAIR WE'LL BE
THE WIZARD AND...
UNLIMITED, MY FUTURE IS UNLIMITED
AND I'VE JUST HAD A VISION ALMOST LIKE A PROPHECY
I KNOW
IT SOUNDS TRULY CRAZY
AND TRUE, THE VISION'S HAZY
BUT I SWEAR SOME DAY THERE'LL BE
A CELEBRATION THROUGHOUT [Oz
THAT'S ALL TO DO
WITH ME!
AND I'LL STAND THERE WITH THE WIZARD
FEELING THINGS I'VE NEVER FELT
AND THOUGH I'D NEVER SHOW IT
I'D BE SO HAPPY I COULD MELT!
AND SO IT WILL BE FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE
AND I'LL WANT NOTHING ELSE 'TILL I DIE
HELD IN SUCH HIGH ESTEEM!
WHEN PEOPLE SEE ME THEY WILL SCREAM
FOR HALF OF [Oz'S FAVORITE TEAM]
THE WIZARD...
AND I!!!!

[linda]

 Dearest, Darlingest Momsy and Popsicle...
[HAMILTON] My dear father...
Both]
THERE'S BEEN SOME CONFUSION OVER ROOMING HERE AT SHIZ
[HAMILTON]
BUT, OF COURSE, I'LL CARE FOR NESSA...
[linda]


BUT, OF COURSE, I'LL RISE ABOVE IT...
Both]
FOR I KNOW THAT'S HOW YOU'D WANT ME TO RESPOND
Yes...
THERE'S BEEN SOME CONFUSION FOR YOU SEE MY ROOMATE IS...
[linda]


UNUSUALLY, AND EXCEEDLINGLY PECULIAR AND ALTOGETHER QUITE IMPOSSIBLE TO DESCRIBE...
[HAMILTON] Blonde.
[linda]


WHAT IS THIS FEELING, SO SUDDEN AND NEW?
[HAMILTON]
I FELT THE MOMENT I LAID EYES ON YOU!
[linda]


MY PULSE IS RUSHING...
[HAMILTON]
MY HEAD IS REELING...
[linda]


MY FACE IS FLUSHING...
Both]
WHAT IS THIS FEELING?
FERVID AS A FLAME,

WE DON'T MEAN TO SHOW A BIAS,
BUT GALINDA, YOU'RE A MARTAR!
[linda]

 Well...

[HAMILTON] Boo!
[linda]

 Ahh!
[HAMILTON] Hahahaha!

[Hamilton]
 Settle down, now! I have read your most recent essays. And I am amazed to report the progress!
Although, some of us still tend to favor form over content... Ms. Glinda.
[linda]

 It's GAlinda.
[Hamilton]
 Excuse me... Glinda.
[linda]

 I really don't see what the problem is. Every other professor seems to be able to pronounce my name.
[HAMILTON] Maybe pronouncing your precious name isn't the sole purpose of Doctor Dillamond's life. Maybe he's not like every other professor. Maybe some of us are different.
[linda]

 Oh! It seems the artichoke is steamed.
[Hamilton]
 Class, class! Miss Elphaba has a point! As you know, I am the sole Animal on the faculty. The token Goat, as it were. But it wasn't always this way. Oh, dear students, how I wish you could have seen it as it once was. Where you could walk down the halls and see an antelope explicating a sonnet, a snow leopard solving an equation, a wildebeast waxing philosophic. Don't you see, dear students, how our dear Ozis becoming less and less...looks at Elphaba... colorful. Now, who can tell me what sent these events into motion?
[HAMILTON] Raises hand From what I've heard, it all started with the great drought.
[Hamilton]
 Exactly. Food grew scarce, people grew hungrier and angrier. And the question became "Whom can we blame?" Can anyone tell me what is meant by the term "Scapegoat"? Elphaba Raises Hand. Someone besides Miss Elphaba? Ah yes, Miss Glinda...
[linda]

 It's GAlinda... with a GA. I don't see why you can't just teach us history instead of always harping on the past.
[Hamilton]
 Well, perhaps these questions will enlighten you... Walks Over To The Chalk Board And Turns It Over. On it is written] ANIMALS SHOULD BE SEEN AND NOT HEARD. Who is responsible for this? I'm waiting for answer... Very well, that will be all for today... You heard me, class dismissed!!!
All Students Exit Except Elphaba & Nessarose. Dillamond Has His Back Turned To Her.
[HAMILTON] You go on ahead, Nessa.
Nessarose Exits.
[HAMILTON] Reading The Board Aloud. "Animals should be seen and not heard..."
[Hamilton]
 Oh, Miss Elphaba, don't worry about me, go along and enjoy your friends.
[HAMILTON] Oh that's alright, I have no friends. Would you like to share my lunch?
[Hamilton]
 Oh, thank you! How kind.
She Pulls Out A Candy Bar And Unwraps It. He Takes The Paper and Begins To Eat It. He Sees The Board.
[Hamilton]
 I seem to have lost my appetite.
[HAMILTON] You shouldn't let statements like that bother you. I mean, I always do, but you shouldn't.
[Hamilton]
if it were only a matter of words on a chalkboard. But the things one hears these days... dreadful things! Miss Elphaba...

I'VE HEARD OF AN OX, A PROFESSOR FROM QUOX
NO LONG PERMITTED TO TEACH,
WHO HAS LOST ALL POWERS OF SPEECH.
AND AN OWL IN MUNCHKIN ROCK
A VICAR WITH A THRIVING FLOCK
FORBIDDEN TO PREACH
NOW HE ONLY CAN SCREECH!
ONLY RUMORS, BUT STILL, ENOUGH TO GIVE PAUSE
TO ANYONE WITH PAWS
SOMETHING BAD IS HAPPENING IN [Oz
[HAMILTON]
SOMETHING BAD?
HAPPENING IN [Oz?
[Hamilton]

UNDER THE SURFACE
BEHIND THE SCENES
SOMETHING BAAAAAH...
Sorry, bad...
[HAMILTON] Dr. Dillamond, are you alright? Shall I fetch you a glass of water?
[Hamilton]
 No, I don't know what came over me.
[HAMILTON] So, you're saying that there are animals that have, somehow, forgotten how to speak? But, how is that possible?
[Hamilton]
 Well, with so much pressure not to...
Morrible Enters.
[Morrible]
 I heard there was some sort of disturburance in class. Are you alright, Doctor? Oh, Miss Elphaba, you're still here! I thought you would have been on your way to my seminar by now.
[HAMILTON] Yes Madame, ordinarily I would be but...
[Morrible]
 But what? I do hope I have not misplaced my trust in you. Magic is a very demanderating mistress, and if one has ambitions of meeting the Wizard. I'm sure Doctor Dillamond sees my point.
Morrible Exits.
[HAMILTON] I'd better go. Doctor Dillamond, if something bad is happening to the Animals then someone has to tell the Wizard. That's why we have a Wizard!
SO NOTHING BAD
Both]
NOTHNG ALL THAT BAD
[Hamilton]

NOTHING TRULY BAAAAHHH...
Sorry... Bad.
[HAMILTON]
IT COULDN'T HAPPEN HERE,
IN [Oz...


[BURR]
 Here we are, sir! Shiz University!
[BURR]
 What? Already?
[BURR]
 Yes, sir.
[BURR]
 What a shame. Well, we'll see you soon, Avaric. Don't worry, I won't last longer at this school than I did at any of the others.
Avaric Exits.
[Angelica]
 Uh, miss Galinda, I know I'm just a munchkin, but munchkins have feelings too, and I've been trying to tell you mine, for you. But sometimes it seems like you don't even know I'm there.
[linda]

 That's not true, Biq.
[Angelica]
 It's LAFAYETE.
[linda]

 Biq, do you know who that is? That's Fiyero Tiggular, tha Winkie Prince whose reputation is so scandalacious!
LAFAYETE Looks Disgusted. Fiyero Walks Toward Them. Galinda Swishes Her Hair. Fiyero, Noticing Her Strange Behavior, Does The Same.
[linda]

 To Fiyero. Were you looking for something or someone?
[BURR]
 Uhhh yea... history... class? I don't know... somewhere?
[Angelica]
 History building is way over there my friend...
[linda]

 That class just ended!
[BURR]
 Oh! Perfect timing! So, uh, what does one do for fun around here?
[linda]

 Nothing really... until now...
[Angelica]
 We've been studying!
[BURR]
 Well, I see that once again the responsibility to corrupt my fellow students falls to me. Fortunately, I'm up for the task.


[BURR]

THE TROUBLE WITH SCHOOLS IS
THEY ALWAYS TRY TO TEACH THE WRONG LESSON
BELIEVE ME, I'VE BEEN KICKED OUT OF ENOUGH OF THEM TO KNOW!
THEY WANT YOU TO BECOME LESS CALLOW, LESS SHALLOW,
BUT I SAY WHY INVITE STRESS IN?
STOP STUDYING STRIFE
AND LEARN TO LIVE
THE UNEXAMINED LIFE...
DANCIN' THROUGH LIFE
SKIMMING THE SURFACE
GLIDING WHERE TURF IS SMOOTH
LIFE IS PAINLESS FOR THE BRAINLESS
THOSE WHO DON'T TRY, NEVER LOOK FOOLISH
DANCING THROUGH LIFE
NO NEED TO TOUGH IT
WHEN YOU CAN SLUFF IT OFF AS I DO
NOTHING MATTERS, BUT KNOWING NOTHING MATTERS
IT'S JUST LIFE, SO KEEP DANCING THROUGH
DANCING THROUGH LIFE
SWAYING AND SWEEPING
AND ALWAYS KEEPING COOL
LIFE IS FRAUGHTLESS
WHEN YOU'RE THOUGHTLESS
THOSE WHO DON'T TRY
NEVER LOOK FOOLISH
DANCING THROUGH LIFE
MINDLESS AND CARELESS
MAKE SURE YOU'RE WHERE LESS TROUBLE IS RIFE
WHOES ARE FLEETING
BLOWS ARE GLANCING
WHEN YOU'RE DANCING
THROUGH LIFE!
So! What's the most swankified place in town?
[linda]

 That would be the

Sounds perfect!
LET'S GO DOWN TO THE [OzDUST BALLROOM
WE'LL MEET THERE LATER TONIGHT
WE CAN DANCE 'TIL IT'S LIGHT
FIND THE PRETTIEST GIRL
GIVE HER A WHIRL!
RIGHT ON DOWN TO THE [OzDUST BALLROOM
COME ON FOLLOW ME!
YOU'LL BE HAPPY TO BE THERE
[Students]

DANCIN' THROUGH LIFE, DOWN AT THE [OzDUST (LIFE!)
[BURR]

IF ONLY BECAUSE DUST IS WHAT WE COME TO!
[Students]

NOTHIN' MATTERS, BUT KNOWING NOTHING MATTERS
IT'S JUST LIFE!!!
[BURR]

SO KEEP DANCING THROUGH...
[Angelica]
 Miss Galinda? I hope you'll save at least one dance for me. I'll be waiting right there, right by your side, waiting, all night.
[linda]

 Oh, how very kind, Biq.
[Angelica]
 ... LAFAYETE...
[linda]

 But, do you know what would be even kinder?
SEE THAT TRAGICALLY BEAUTIFUL GIRL?
THE ONE IN THE CHAIR?
IT SEEMS SO UNFAIR
WE SHOULD GO ON A SPREE
AND NOT SHE, GEE
I KNOW SOMEONE WOULD BE MY HERO
IF THAT SOMEONE WERE
TO GO INVITE HER!
[Angelica]
 Well, maybe I could invite her!
[linda]


OH, BIQ, REALLY?
YOU WOULD DO THAT FOR ME?
[Angelica]
 I would do anything for you, Miss Galinda. Walks Over To Nessarose.
Excuse me, Miss Nessarose? There's something I'd like to ask you...
[BURR]
 To Galinda. You're good.
[linda]

 I don't know what you mean. But I do happen to be free tonight, so...
[BURR]
 So, I'll be picking you up around eight?
[linda]

 After all...
NOW THAT WE'VE MET ONE ANOTHER,
Both]
IT'S CLEAR WE DESERVE EACHOTHER!
[linda]

 You're perfect!
[BURR]
 You're perfect!
[CAST]
SO WE'RE PERFECT TOGETHER
BORN TO BE FOREVER
DANCING THROUGH LIFE!!!
[HAMILTON] It's absurd! This silly, rich boy appears and everyone's off to worship him and some cultish social gathering!
[Angelica]
 Even me! I'm going! Isn't it wonderful? LAFAYETE was too shy to ask me at first, but once Galinda encouraged him...
[HAMILTON] Galinda?!
[Angelica]
 Don't you dare say another word against her! I'm about to have the first happy night of my life all thanks to Galinda!
FINALLY FOR THIS ONE NIGHT,
I'M ABOUT TO HAVE A FUN NIGHT
WITH THIS MUNCHKIN BOY GALINDA FOUND FOR ME
AND I ONLY WISH THERE WERE
SOMETHING I COULD DO FOR HER TO REPAY HER
ELPHABA SEE...
WE DESERVE EACHOTHER AND GALINDA HELPED IT COME TRUE
WE DESERVE EACHOTHER, ME AND LAFAYETE
Please, Elphaba, try to understand.
[HAMILTON] I do...
[linda]

 Now I must accessorize myself for Fiyero.
Shen Shen Pulls The Witch's Hat Out Of One Of Galinda's Hat Boxes.
Pfanee] Galinda, what in [Oz's name!?
[linda]

 Now, just pretend you didn't see that. My granny is always giving me the most hideodeous hats.
I'd give it away, but I don't hate anyone that much.
Shen Shen] Yes you do!
Pfanee] Give it to her! Just do it!
They All Stare At Elphaba. Galinda Walks Forward, Meeting Elphaba Half Way.
[HAMILTON] Galinda, listen, Nessa and I were talking about you just now...
[linda]

 And I was just talking about you! I thought you might want to wear this hat to the party tonight! Gives Her The Hat.
IT'S REALLY... UH... SHARP!
DON'T YOU THINK?
Y'KNOW BLACK, IS THIS YEAR'S PINK!
YOU DESERVE EACHOTHER,
THIS HAT AND YOU,
YOU'RE BOTH SO... SMART!
YOU DESERVE EACHOTHER, SO HERE!
OUT OF THE GOODNESS OF MY HEART!
Galinda Runs Off. Elphaba Laughs At The Sight Of The Hat. She Exits.. The Students Enter And Dance.
When This Is Done, LAFAYETE And Nessarose Appear, Awkwardly Holding Hands.
[Angelica]
 What's in the punch?
[Angelica]
 Lemons, and melons, and pears!
[Angelica]
 Oh my!
[Angelica]

LISTEN NESSA...
[Angelica]
 Yes?
[Angelica]

UH, NESSA...
I'VE GOT SOMETHING TO CONFESS A
REASON WHY, WELL, WHY I ASKED YOU HERE TONIGHT...
NOW, I KNOW IT ISN'T FAIR.
[Angelica]
 Oh, LAFAYETE, I know why.
[Angelica]
 You do?
[Angelica]

IT'S BECAUSE I'M IN THIS CHAIR, AND YOU FELT SORRY FOR ME...
WELL, ISN'T THAT RIGHT?
[Angelica]
 No... it's because... uh... because...
BECAUSE YOU ARE SO BEAUTIFUL!
[Angelica]
 Oh, LAFAYETE!
I THINK YOU'RE WONDERFUL!
AND WE DESERVE EACH OTHER, DON'T YOU SEE THIS IS OUR CHANCE?
WE DESERVE EACH OTHER, DON'T WE LAFAYETE?
[Angelica]
 You know what? Let's dance!
[Angelica]
 What?
[Angelica]

LET'S DANCE!
They Dance, As Well As The Others Around Them. Finally, Mme. Morrible Runs Up To Galinda.
[Morrible]
 Oh, Miss Upland?
[linda]

 Madame Morrible... What are you doing here?
[Morrible]
 I have something for you. She Hands Her A Small Wand.
[linda]

 Gasps. Madame... a training wand... How can I ever express my graditution?
[Morrible]
 Oh, don't thank me! This was your roommate's idea, not mine.
[linda]

 What? Elphaba?
[Morrible]
 Miss Elphaba requested that I include you in sorcery class. She insisted I tell you this very night or she would quit the seminar.
[linda]

 But... why?
[Morrible]
 I have no idea. My personal opinion is you do not have what it takes. I hope you'll prove me wrong... I doubt you will.
She Leaves. Fiyero Comes Up To Galinda.
[BURR]
 What is it?
[linda]

 I got what I wanted...
[BURR]
 Then what's the matter?
[linda]

 Nothing...
[BURR]
 Good. Let's dance...
They Begin To Dance As Elphaba Walks In. They Stop As All The Students Gasp And Make Comments About The Way She Is Dressed. People Then Start Laughing.
[BURR]
 Who in Ozis this?
[linda]

 My roommate... please, don't ... stare!
[BURR]
 How can you help it?
Elphaba Takes Off The Hat, Noticing The Comments. She Waits, Then Puts It Back On And Begins To Dance. She Is Alone. There Is No Music.
[BURR]
 Well I'll say this, she doesn't give a twig about what anyone else thinks.
[linda]

 Of course does, she just pretends not to... I feel awful...
[BURR]
 Why? It's not like it's your fault.
[linda]

 Excuse me... She Walks Over To Elphaba and Clears Her Throat. May I cut in?
Galinda Begins Dancing Just As Horribly. The Students Now Accept It, And Begin To Dance Again As The Music Starts.
All]
DANCING THROUGH LIFE, DOWN AT THE [OzDUST
IF ONLY BECAUSE DUST IS WHAT WE COME TO
AND THE STRANGE THING, YOUR LIFE COULD END UP CHANGING
WHILE YOU'RE DANCING THROUGH

[Scene 9 - Sharing Secrets]
Elphaba & Galinda Barge Into Their Suite... Galinda Is In Hysterics.
[linda]

 Your very first party ever?! Your very first party! Oh I know! Let's tell each other something we've never told anyone... I'll go first] Fiyero and I are going to be married (squeals).
[HAMILTON] Really? He's asked you already?
[linda]

 No, he doesn't know yet... Now, you tell me a secret.
[HAMILTON] Like what?
[linda]

 Like... Why do you always sleep with this funny, little, green bottle under your pillow? Grabs The Bottle.
[HAMILTON] Give that back.
[linda]

 C'mon, tell me. Tell me tell me!
[HAMILTON] It was my mother's! That's all...
Silence.
[linda]

 Hands Her The Bottle. It's not fair. I told you a really good one.
[HAMILTON] My father hates me.
[linda]

 Gasps.
[HAMILTON] No, that's not the secret. It's my fault...
[linda]

 What is?
[HAMILTON] ... that my sister is the way she is. . Pause. You see, when my mother was carrying Nessa, my father was worried that the new baby might come out...
Both] Green.
[HAMILTON] So he made my mother chew milk flowers, day and night. But that made Nessa come too soon, with her little legs all tangled. And my mother never woke up. None of which ever would have happened if not for me.
[linda]

 But that was the milkflowers fault, not yours. That may be your secret, Elphaba, but that doesn't make it true. She Oh look, it's tomorrow! Elphie... do you mind if I call you Elphie?
[HAMILTON] Well, it's a little perky.
[linda]

 And you can call me... Galinda. So... Elphie... now that we're friends, I've decided to make you my new project!
[HAMILTON] You really don't have to do that.
[linda]

 I know, that's what makes me so nice!

[linda]


WHENEVER I SEE SOMEONE LESS FORTUNATE THAN I

WE'RE GONNA MAKE YOU POPULAR!
WHEN I SEE DEPRESSING CREATURES
WITH UNPREPOSSESSING FEATURES,
I REMIND THEM ON THEIR OWN BEHALF
TO THINK OF
CELEBRATED HEADS OF STATE
OR ESPECIALLY GREAT COMMUNICATORS
DID THEY HAVE BRAINS OR KNOWLEDGE?
DON'T MAKE ME LAUGH!
THEY WERE POPULAR
PLEASE, IT'S ALL ABOUT POPULAR
IT'S NOT ABOUT APTITUDE
IT'S THE WAY YOU'RE VIEWED
SO IT'S VERY SHREWD TO BE
VERY VERY POPULAR
LIKE ME!
[HAMILTON] This is never going to work!
[linda]

 Oh Elphie, you mustn't think that way anymore! Your whole life is going to change... and all because of me. Okay, stand... I will turn your frock into a beautiful ball gown! Stand up... She Picks Up Her Wand And Waves It. Ball gown!!! Nothing Happens, So She Repeats. Ball gown!!! Still Nothing Happens. She Taps Her Wand On The Bed. Is this thing on?
[HAMILTON] Do you want me to try?
[linda]

 No, I've got it! She Throws The Wand Down. Oh, just wear the frock... it's pretty! Now,
I'll show you how to flip your hair] Flip flip. Or you could use your hand. Demonstrates.
Or, you can use your whole body. Falls onto bed. Squeals. Now, for the finishing touch.
Takes flower out of her hair, puts it into Elphaba's. Why, Miss Elphaba, look at you, you're beautiful. Hands her the mirror.
[HAMILTON] After Looking In The Mirror. I... I have to go.
She Runs Off.
[linda]

 You're Welcome! She Admires Herself In The Mirror.
AND THOUGH YOU PROTEST
YOUR DISINTEREST,
I KNOW CLANDESTINELY...
YOU'RE GONNA GRIN AND BEAR IT
YOUR NEW FOUND POPULARITY! (SQUEALS)
LA LA LA LA
YOU'LL BE POPULAR!
JUST NOT QUITE AS POPULAR
AS ME!!!

[HAMILTON] Flips her hair.. Flip Flip! What?
[BURR]
 Nothing, it's just... you've been "Galinda-fied". You don't have to do that , you know?
[Hamilton]
 Alright, take your seats, class! I have something to say, and very little time to say it. This is my last day here at Shiz I am no longer permitted to teach. I want to thank you for your sharing your enthusiasm, your essays, no matter how feebly structured, and even, on occasion, your lunch.
Mme. Morrible Rushes In.
[Morrible]
 Doctor Dillamond! I'm so dreadfully sorry.
[HAMILTON] Madame, we've got to do something.
[Hamilton]
 Miss Elphaba, they can take away my job, but I shall continue speaking out.
Scientist] Come on, goat...
To Men Begin To Carry Him Out Of The Room.
[Hamilton]
 They are not telling you the whole story! Remember that, class! Remember that.
He Is Gone.
[HAMILTON] Doctor Dillamond! After A Pause. Well, are you just going to sit here in silence?
[Morrible]
 Miss Elphaba, there is nothing we can do. Please take your seat.
Professor] Good afternoon, students!
[Morrible]
 Good afternoon.
Professor] Every day, with every tick of the Time Dragon Clock, in every corner of our great [Oz, one hears the silence of progress. For example] this is called a cage!
He Points To A Cage With A Cloth Draped Over It. He Pulls Off The Cloth, Revealing A Lion Cub Inside.
Professor] Now, we will be seeing more and more of them in the near future. This remarkable innovation is actually for the Animal's own good...
[HAMILTON] If this is for his own good, then why is he trembling?
Professor] He's just excited to be here, that's all. Hits the cage. Now, as I was saying, one of the benefits of caging a Lion cub while he's young is that he never, in fact, will learn how to speak.
[HAMILTON] What?
He Motions The Students Forward, Toward The Cage.
Professor] That's right! Come closer!
[HAMILTON] To Fiyero. Can you imagine a world where Animals are kept in cages and they never speak?
Professor] Now, he may seem a bit agitated but that's easily remedied.
[HAMILTON] What should I do?
[BURR]
 I don't know.
[HAMILTON] Well, somebody has to... Do something!!!
Sparks Begin To Fly Everywhere. All Students & The Professor Are Moving Uncontrollably Except Fiyero and Elphaba.
[BURR]
 What's happening?
[HAMILTON] I don't know I got mad...andd
[BURR]
 Alright just don't move! And don't get mad at me... He Grabs The Cage. Well are you coming?
She Runs With Him After He Snatches The Lion Cub.
[HAMILTON] Careful! Don't shake him!
[BURR]
 I'm not!
[HAMILTON] We can't just let him loose anywhere, you know. We have to find someplace safe...
[BURR]
 Don't you think that I realize that? You must think I'm really stupid or something!
[HAMILTON] No, not really stupid.
[BURR]
 Why is it that every time I see you you're causing some sort of commotion?
[HAMILTON] I don't cause commotions, I am one.
[BURR]
 That's for sure.
[HAMILTON] Oh! So you think I should just keep my mouth shut! Is that what you're saying?
[BURR]
 No, I'm...
[HAMILTON] Do you think I want to be this way? Do you think I want to care this much? Don't you know how much easier my life would be if I didn't?
[BURR]
 Do you ever let anyone else talk?
[HAMILTON] Oh, sorry... But can I just say one more thing? You could have just walked away back there.
[BURR]
 So?
[HAMILTON] So, no matter how shallow and self-absorbed you tend to be...
[BURR]
 Excuse me, there's no pretense here. I happen to be genuinely self-absorbed and deeply shallow.
[HAMILTON] No you're not. Or you wouldn't be so unhappy.
[BURR]
 Fine, if you don't want my help...
[HAMILTON] No, I do! Poor little thing, it's heart is trembling... I didn't mean for...
[BURR]
 What did you mean to do? Why was I the only one you didn't do it to?
[HAMILTON] Oh look, you're bleeding... it must have scratched you. Referring To A Cut On His Face.
[BURR]
 Yea... or maybe it scratched me. I better get to safety... I mean the cub... get the cub to safety. He Walks Off.
[HAMILTON] Fiyero...

[[HAMILTON]
Miss Elphaba, there you are!
[HAMILTON] Madame Morrible...
[Morrible]
 Oh Miss Elphaba, I finally heard back from the Wizard!
[HAMILTON] The Wizard?
[Morrible]
 Yes, he wishes to meet you!
[HAMILTON] He asked for me?
[Morrible]
 Yes! I know how devastated you were the other day for our poor Doctor Dillamond, but I can assure you my dear, as one door closes, another one opens. She Hands Her A Green Envelope.
[HAMILTON] Madame, I don't know what to say! How can I ever thank you? She Hugs Her.
[Morrible]
 Oh careful dear, you musn't get wet She Places The Umbrella Back Over Elphaba's Head. Oh, I know! She Waves Her Hands And The Sun Comes Out. Didn't I tell you? Weather is my specialty. [Oz-speed, my dear! Make me proud.
[HAMILTON] I will, I'll try.
Morrible Exits.

[HAMILTON]
AND THERE WE'LL FINALLY BE
THE WIZARD AND I...

Conductor] All aboard!
[linda]

 Remember, eye contact. And don't forget to tell him how wonderful he is, Wizards love that! And be yourself... well... within reason.
LAFAYETE Wheels Nessarose Onstage.
[Angelica]
 Elphaba, I'm so proud of you and I know father would be too. We're all proud, aren't we?
[HAMILTON] You'll be alright, won't you?
[linda]

 She'll be fine! Biq will take care of her, right?
[Angelica]
 ...It's LAFAYETE... I... I can't do this anymore.
He Exits.
[Angelica]
 LAFAYETE...
[linda]

 Nessa, maybe he's just not the right one... for you.
[Angelica]
 No, it's me that's not right. Elphaba, just go, I'll be fine.
She Wheels Herself Offstage.
[HAMILTON] Nessa, wait!
[linda]

 Let her go. She'll have to manage without you. We all will.
[HAMILTON] Please, you'll barely even notice I'm gone. Besides, you have Fiyero. Where is he, anyway? Not that I expected him to say goodbye to me. We barely know each other.
[linda]

 I don't know him either. He's distant, and moodified, and he's been thinking, which really worrries me. I never knew how much he card about that old goat.
Fiyero Enters.
[linda]

 Oh, there he is! Fiyero, over here dearest!
[BURR]
 He Hands Elphaba Flowers. Elphaba, I'm happy for you.
[linda]

 Yes, we are both so happy...
[BURR]
 Uh, listen, I've been thinking...
[HAMILTON] Yes, I've heard.
[BURR]
 About that Lion cub and... everything. I think about that day a lot.
[HAMILTON] Really? So do I.
[linda]

 Me too! Poor Doctor Dillamond. It makes one want to... uh...
take a stand. So I've been thinking of... uh... changing my name.
[BURR]
 Your name?
[linda]

 Well, yes! Since Doctor Dillamond had his own way of pronouncing my name,
in solidarity and to express my outrage, I will henceforward be known no longer as Galinda, but as simply, Glinda.
[BURR]
 Oh well, that's very admirable of you... Glinda. To Elphaba. Elphaba, good luck.
He Runs Off.
[Burr] There, see?
[HAMILTON] Galinda...
[Burr] It's Glinda now. Stupid idea, I don't even know what made me say it.
[HAMILTON] It doesn't matter what your name is, everyone loves you!
[Burr] I don't care! I want him. I don't even think he's perfect anymore and I still want him.
This must be what other people feel like. How do they bear it? They embrace.

[HAMILTON] Come with me.
[Burr] Where?
[HAMILTON] To the Emerald City.
[Burr] Really?
[Ozia]

ONE SHORT DAY, IN THE EMERALD CITY...
[Burr] I've always wanted to see the Emerald City!

[Burr] All the hustle and bustle! It's all so [Ozmopolitan! Elphie... Elphie? C'mon we'll be late for WizOMania.
[HAMILTON] I want to remember this moment, always. Nobody's pointing, nobody's staring, for the first time, I'm somewhere that I belong.
[Burr] You look positively, emerald.
The Stage Lights Dim & Wizomania (The Musical) Begins.

All]
DAY!!!

A Large Head Is Rolled Onstage... It Speaks To The Two... Voice Booming
[Hamilton]
I am [Oz, the great and terrible! Who are you and why do you seek me?
[Burr] Say something!
[HAMILTON] Uh... Elphaba Thropp your terribleness!
His Speaks Normally.
[Hamilton]
Oh? Is that you Elphaba? I didn't realize!
He Climbs Out Of The Head.
[Hamilton]
I hope I didn't startle you, it's so hard to make out peoples' faces all the way back there.
So, let's see... which is which? Elphaba! He grabs her hands. And you must be.
[Burr] Glinda. The Ga is silent.
Elphaba touches the Ozmask.
[Hamilton]
I know. It isn't much, is it? But people expect this sort of thing. You have to give people what they want.
The thing is, I hardly ever let people meet the real me, but this being special occasion.
[HAMILTON] I'm so happy to meet you.
[Hamilton]
Well, that's good. 'Cause that's what I love best] making people happy!
I AM A SENTIMENTAL MAN
WHO ALWAYS LONGED TO BE A FATHER
THAT'S WHY I DO THE BEST I CAN
TO TREAT EACH CITIZEN OF OzAS SON
OR DAUGHTER
SO ELPHABA I'D LIKE TO RAISE YOU HIGH
'CUZ I THINK EVERYONE DESERVES THE CHANCE TO FLY!
AND HELPING YOU WITH YOUR ASCENT
ALLOWS ME TO FEEL SO PARENTAL.
FOR I AM
A SENTIMENTAL MAN!
[HAMILTON] I'm here... we're here to alert you that something bad is happening...
[Hamilton]
Please, I'm the Wizard of [Oz. I already know why you've come.
Elphaba & [Burr] Oooo.
[Hamilton]
Of course, you must prove yourself...
[Burr] Prove yourself, prove yourself.
[HAMILTON] But how?
[Hamilton]
Oh, I don't know.
SOME SORT OF GESTURE
MOSTLY FOR SHOW
SOMETHING TO TEST YOUR ADEPTNESS..
I know! Madame, the book!
Morrible Enters.
[Burr] Madame Morrible...
[Hamilton]
I believe you're well acquainted with my new Press Secretary.
[HAMILTON] Press Secretary?
[Morrible]
 Oh, yes dearies, I've risen up in the world. You'll find that the Wizard is a very generous man.
If you do something for him, he'll do much for you.
[HAMILTON] What do yhou want me to do?
[Hamilton]
Well, this is my monkey servent, Chistery. He looks so longingly at the birds every morning....
[Morrible]
 So the Wizard was thinking, perhaps, a levitation spell...
[Burr] Noticing A Book In Morrible's Hands. Is that the Grimmerie?
[Morrible]
 Yes, the ancient book of spells and enchantments. Hands It To Elphaba.
[Burr] Whispers. Can I touch it?
Morrlbe] Whispers. No!
[HAMILTON] What funny writing...
[Morrible]
 Well it's a lost language. The lost language of spells.
[Hamilton]
It's kind of a recipe book for change.
[Morrible]
 Don't be discouraged if you can't decipherate it, dearie.
I, myself, can only read a spell or two, and that took years and years
[HAMILTON]
AHVEN, TATEY, AVEN TATEY AVEN...
[Hamilton]
She Continues Chanting. Oh, Chistery, what a experience you are about to have!
[HAMILTON] .................................. AH MAY AH TAY ATUM
[Hamilton]
SINCE ONCE I HAVE MY OWN DAY IN THE SKY...
[HAMILTON] AH MAY AH TAH TAY MAY TU SE SAY TA!
[Hamilton]
I KNOW EVERYONE DESERVES THE CHANCE TO FLY!
Chistery Screams & Begins To Twitch.
[HAMILTON] What happened? Is something wrong?
[Morrible]
 No just a transition, dearie.
[HAMILTON] No, stop you're hurting him!
[Hamilton]
She's actually done it!
Chistery Sprouts Wings. And Begins Running Around The Stage.
[HAMILTON] NO! Quick, how do I reverse it?
[Morrible]
 You can't!
[HAMILTON] What?!
[Morrible]
 You can't! Spells are irreversible! I knew she had the power, I told you!
[HAMILTON] You planned all this?
[Morrible]
 Well, you benefit too, dearie! You benefit, too.
[Hamilton]
And this is only the beginning! Look.
The Other Monkeys Begin To Grow Wings And Fly.
[Morrible]
 Won't they make perfect spies?
[HAMILTON] Spies?!
[Hamilton]
You're right, that's a harsh word... how about scouts? That's what they'll be really. They'll fly around [Oz! Report any subversive Animal activity.
[HAMILTON] You can't read this book at all! Can you? That's why you need enemies, and cages, and spies. You have no real power.
[Hamilton]
Exactly... that's why I need you. Don't you see? The world is your oyster, now! You have so many...opportunites. You both do.
[Burr] Thank you, your [Ozness.
Wizard]
SINCE ONCE I HAD MY OWN DAY IN THE SKY
I KNOW EVERYONE DESERVES THE CHANCE TO...
[HAMILTON] NO!
She Runs Off.
[Morrible]
 Elphaba!
[Burr] Elphie! I am so sorry, your Wizardship. I'll fetch her back! Elphie wait!
She Runs After Her.
[Hamilton]
We must get her back. She knows too much.
[Morrible]
 Don't worry! I will handle it.
He Gets Back In The Head. Speaking, Again, With A Powerful Voice.
[Hamilton]
Guards, guards! There is a fugitive loose in the palace! Find her, capture her, and bring her to me!
Guards] Yes your [Ozness!

[Burr] Elphie, wait! Where are you going?
[HAMILTON] Oh no! There are no more stairs! This might be the attic...
[Burr] Elphaba, listen to me...
[HAMILTON] I have to barricade the door! She Picks Up A Broom And Places It Over A Trap Door.
[Burr] Elphaba, why couldn't you have stayed calm for once instead of flying off the handle?
I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY
I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY NOW
I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY HOW YOU'VE HURT YOUR CAUSE FOREVER
I HOPE YOU THINK YOU'RE CLEVER
[HAMILTON]
I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY! I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY TOO
I HOPE YOU'RE PROUD HOW YOU WOULD GROVEL IN SUBMISSION
TO FEED YOUR OWN AMBISSION
Both]
SO THOUGH I CAN'T IMAGINE HOW
I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY
RIGHT NOW...
[Morrible]
 Citizens of [Oz, there is an enemy that must be found and captured! Believe nothing she says. She's evil. Responsible for the mutilation of these poor, innocent monkeys! Her green skin is but an outward manifestation of her twisted nature! This distortion... this repulsion... this... Wicked Witch!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[Burr] Don't be afraid...
[HAMILTON] I'm not... it's the Wizard who should be afraid... of me!
[Burr] Elphie, just say you're sorry before it's too late.
YOU CAN STILL BE WITH THE WIZARD
WHAT YOU'VE WORKED AND WAITED FOR
YOU CAN HAVE ALL YOU EVER WANTED...
[HAMILTON] I know...
BUT I DON'T WANT IT
NO, I CAN'T WANT IT
ANYMORE...
SOMETHING HAS CHANGED WITHIN ME
SOMETHING IS NOT THE SAME
I'M THROUGH WITH PLAYING BY THE RULES
OF SOMEONE ELSE'S GAME!
TOO LATE FOR SECOND GUESSING
TOO LATE TO GO BACK TO SLEEP
IT'S TIME TO TRUST MY INSTINCTS
CLOSE MY EYES...
AND LEAP
IT'S TIME TO TRY DEFYING GRAVITY
I THINK I'LL TRY DEFYING GRAVITY
AND YOU CAN'T PULL ME DOWN
[Burr]
CAN'T I MAKE YOU UNDERSTAND
YOU'RE HAVING DELUSIONS OF GRANDURE?
[HAMILTON]
I'M THROUHG EXCEPTING LIMITS
'CUZ SOMEONE SAYS THEY'RE SO
SOME THINGS I CANNOT CHANGE,
BUT 'TIL I TRY I'LL NEVER KNOW!
TOO LONG I'VE BEEN AFRAID OF
LOSING LOVE I GUESS I'D LOST
WELL IF THAT'S LOVE,
IT COMES AT MUCH TOO HIGH A COST!
I'D SOONER BUY DEFYING GRAVITY
KISS ME GOODBYE I'M DEFYING GRAVITY
AND YOU CAN'T PULL ME DOWN!
The Guards Bang On The Locked Door.
[Guard]
 Open this door, in the name of his supreme [Ozness!
[HAMILTON] Ah May Ah Tay Ah Tum Ditum...
[Burr]
That's what started all this in the first place... that hideous levitation spell! STOP!!!
[Burr] Well... Where are your wings? Maybe you're not as powerful as you think you are...
A Broomstick Floats Across The Room Towards Elphaba.
[HAMILTON] I told you, Glinda... I did it, I tell ya!
The Guards Bang On The Door Once Again.
[HAMILTON] Quick! Get on!
[Burr] What?
[HAMILTON] Come with me... think of what we could do... together.
UNLIMITED, TOGETHER WE'RE UNLIMITED
TOGETHER WE'LL BE THE GREATEST TEAM THERE'S EVER BEEN, GLINDA
DREAMS THE WAY WE PLANNED 'EM
[Burr]
IF WE WORK IN TANDEM
Both]
JUST YOU AND I DEFYING GRAVITY
WITH YOU AND I DEFYING GRAVITY
[HAMILTON]
THEY'LL NEVER BRING US DOWN.
Well, are you coming?
[Burr] Elphie, you're trembling... here, put this around you...
She Drapes A Black Cape Around Her.
I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY
NOW THAT YOU'RE CHOOSING THIS
[HAMILTON] You too.
I HOPE IT BRINGS YOU BLISS
Both]
I REALLY HOPE YOU GET IT
AND YOU DON'T LIVE TO REGRET IT
I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY IN THE END!
I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY...
MY FRIEND...
Elphaba Runs Off. The Guards Break Down The Door.
[Guard]
 There she is! Don't let her get away!
They Grab Hold Of Glinda.
[Burr]
What in [Oz?! Let go of me! Do you hear me? Let go!
[HAMILTON]
It's not her. She has nothing to do with. I'm the one you want. It's me. Hahahahaha. It's me! Up here! It's me!
She Rises Up Center Stage Holding Her Broom.
[HAMILTON]
SO IF YOU CARE TO FIND ME,
LOOK TO THE WESTERN SKY
AS SOMEONE TOLD ME LATELY,
EVERYONE DESERVES THE CHANCE TO FLY!
AND IF I'M FLYING SOLO,
AT LEAST I'M FLYING FREE!
TO THOSE WHO GROUND ME,
TAKE A MESSAGE BACK FROM ME!
TELL THEM HOW I AM DEFYING GRAVITY!!!
I'M FLYING HIGH DEFYING GRAVITY!!!
AND SOON I'LL MATCH THEM IN RENOWN
AND NOBODY
IN ALL OF [Oz...

FINALLY A DAY THAT'S TOTALLY WICKED WITCH FREE
All]
WE COULDN'T BE HAPPIER
THANK GOODNESS!
[Morrible]
 And thank goodness for you, Glinda, and your handsome swain, our new captain of the guard.
To Fiyero. Now you've been at the forefront of the hunt for the Wicked Witch, haven't you?
[BURR]
 Not really, but I don't like to think of her as a Wicked Witch.
[Morrible]
 Captain, how does it feel?
[BURR]
 Frustrating... but I became captain of the guard to find her, and I will keep searching!
[Morrible]
 No, being engaged!
[Ozia]
 Congratulotions!
[BURR]
 To Glinda - Confused. This is an engagement party?
[Burr] Surprised?
[BURR]
 Yes!
[Burr] Good, we hoped you'd be... the Wizard and I!
WE COULDN'T BE HAPPIER
RIGHT DEAR?
COULDN'T BE HAPPIER
RIGHT HERE
LOOK WHAT WE'VE GOT
A FAIRY TALE PLOT
OUR VERY OWN HAPPY ENDING
WHERE WE COULDN'T BE HAPPIER
TRUE DEAR?
COULDN'T BE HAPPIER
AND WE'RE HAPPY TO SHARE OUR ENDING VICARIOUSLY
WITH ALL OF YOU!
HE COULDN'T LOOK HANDSOMER
I COULDN'T BE HUMBLER
BECAUSE HAPPY IS WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN ALL YOUR DREAMS COME TRUE...
[Morrible]
 And Glinda, dear, we're happy for you! As Press Secretary,
I have striven to ensure that all of Ozknows the story of your braverism! How I vividly remember...
THE DAY YOU WERE FIRST SUMMONED
TO AN AUDIENCE WITH [Oz,
AND ALTHOUGH HE WOULD NOT TELL YOU WHY INITIALLY
WHEN YOU BOWED BEFORE HIS THROWN
HE DECREED YOU'D HENCE BE KNOWN
AS GLINDA THE GOOD
OFFICIALLY!
[BURR]
 That's not how you described it to me.
[Burr] Oh no, not exactly, but Whispers we'll talk about it later.
[Morrible]

THEN WITH A JEALOUS SQUEEE
THE WICKED WITCH BURST FROM CONCEALMENT
WHERE SHE HAD BEEN LURKING
SURREPTITIALLY!
Gasps From Among The Crowd.
[Ozian]
I HEAR SHE HAS AN EXTRA EYE THAT ALWAYS REMAINS AWAKE!
[Ozian]
I HEAR THAT SHE CAN SHED HER SKIN AS EASILY AS A SNAKE!
[Ozian]
I HEAR SOME REBEL ANIMALS ARE GIVING HER FOOD AND SHELTER!
[Ozian]
I HEAR HER SOUL IS SO UNCLEAN, PURE WATER CAN MELT HER!
[BURR]
 What?
[Ozia]

MELT HER! PLEASE SOMEBODY GO AND MELT HER!
[BURR]
 Do you hear that?! Water will melt her? People are so empty-headed they'll believe anything!
[Burr] Excuse me just a tick-tock!
Her And Fiyero Talk Aside.
[BURR]
 I can't just stand here grinning pretending to go along with all of this!
[Burr] Do you think I like to hear them say those awful things about her? I hate it!
[BURR]
 Then what are we doing here? Let's go, let's get out of here!
[Burr] We can't leave now, not when people are looking to us to raise their spirits.
[BURR]
 You can't leave, because you can't resist this. And that is the truth.
[Burr] Maybe I can't. Is that so wrong? Who could?
[BURR]
 You know who could. Who has.
[Burr] Fiyero, I miss her too, but we can't just stop living. No one has searched harder for her than you. But don't you see? She doesn't want to be found. We have to face it.
[BURR]
 You're right. I'm sorry, you're right. And if it's going tol make you happy, of course I'll marry you.
[Burr] But it'll make you happy too, right?
[BURR]
 You know me... I'm always happy. He Runs Off.
[Burr] Fiyero! Thanks plenty dearest! He's gone to fetch me a refreshment, he's so thoughtful that way!
THAT'S WHY I COULDN'T BE HAPPIER
NO, I COULDN'T BE HAPPIER
THOUGH IT IS I ADMIT, THE TINIEST BIT
UNLIKE I ANTICIPATED,
BUT I COULDN'T BE HAPPIER
SIMPLY COULDN'T BE HAPPIER...
Well, not simply...
'CUZ GETTING YOUR DREAMS, IT'S STRANGE BUT IT SEEMS
A LITTLE, WELL, COMPLICATED...
THERE'S A KIND OF A SORT OF COST
THERE'S A COUPLE OF THINGS GET LOST...
THERE ARE BRIDGES YOU CROSSED YOU DIDN'T KNOW YOU CROSSED UNTIL YOU'VE CROSSED!
AND IF THAT JOY THAT THRILL
DOESN'T THRILL LIKE YOU THINK IT WILL...
STILL... WITH THIS PERFECT FINALE
THE CHEERS AND THE BALLYHOO
WHO WOULDN'T BE HAPPIER?
SO I COULDN'T BE HAPPIER
BECAUSE HAPPY IS WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN ALL YOUR DREAMS COME TRUE...
WELL, ISN'T IT?
HAPPY IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOUR DREAMS COME...
TRUE!!!!
[Ozia]

WE LOVE YOU GLINDA IF WE MAY BE SO FRANK!
[Burr]
THANK GOODNESS!
[Ozia]

FOR ALL THIS JOY WE KNOW WHO WE'VE GOT TO THANK!
THANK GOODNESS!
THAT MEANS THE WIZARD, GLINDA...
[Burr]

[Burr] I COULDN'T BE HAPPIER!!!
[Ozia]
 THANK GOODNESS!!!
[Burr] TODAY!!!!
[Ozia]
 TODAY, THANK GOODNESS FOR TODAY!


[Angelica]
 Will there be anything else, Madame?
[Angelica]
 I've asked you to call me Nessarose, remember?
[Angelica]
 Yes, Madame. He Exits.
[Angelica]
 LAFAYETE...
Elphaba's Voice Is Heard Inside A Closet.
[HAMILTON] Well, it seems the beautiful only get more beautiful, Nessarose Screams while the green just get greener.
Nessarose Is Scared And Confused.
Elphaba Steps Out Of The Closet.
[HAMILTON] I'm sorry. Did I scare you? I seem to have that effect on people. It's good to see you.
[Angelica]
 What are you doing here?
[HAMILTON] Well, there's no place like home. I never thought I'd hear myself say this but I need father's help. I need him to stand with me.
[Angelica]
 That's impossible.
[HAMILTON] No, no it's not. Not if you ask him. You know he'll listen to you.
[Angelica]
 Father's dead.
[HAMILTON] What?
[Angelica]
 He's dead. I'm the governor... Well what did you expect? After he learned what you'd done,
how you'd disgraced u,s he died... of shame. Embarrassed to death.
[HAMILTON] Good, I'm glad. It's better that way.
[Angelica]
 That's a wicked thing to say.
[HAMILTON] No, it's true. Because now it's just us. You can help me and together we can...
[Angelica]
 Elphaba, shut up! First of all, I can't harbor a fugitive, I'm an un-elected official!
And why should I help you? You fly around [Oz, trying to rescue animals you've never even met,
and not once have you ever thought to use your powers to rescue me!
ALL OF MY LIFE, I'VE DEPENDED ON YOU
HOW DO YOU THINK THAT FEELS?
ALL OF MY LIFE I'VE DEPENDED ON YOU
AND THIS HIDEOUS CHAIR WITH WHEELS!
SCROUNGING FOR SCRAPS OF PITY TO PICK UP
AND LONGING TO KICK UP
MY HEELS...
[HAMILTON] Nessa, there isn't a spell for everything! The power is mysterious.
It's not like coddling up a pair of... She Pulls Out The Grimmerie From Her Bag. Wait.
[Angelica]
 What are you doing?
Elphaba Begins Chanting.
[Angelica]
 What is that? Ah! My shoes! It feels like... like they're on fire! What have you done to my shoes???
She Lifts Her Dress, Revealing The Ruby Slippers. Nessarose Stands, But Falls. Elphaba Gives Her A Hand.
[Angelica]
 No, don't help me. She Stands.
[HAMILTON] Oh, Nessa, at last...
I'VE DONE WHAT LONG AGO I SHOULD
AND FINALLY FROM THESE POWERS SOMETHING GOOD
FINALLY SOMETHING GOOD...
[Angelica]
 LAFAYETE! LAFAYETE! Come quickly!
[HAMILTON] LAFAYETE?
[Angelica]
 LAFAYETE! Come here at once!
[HAMILTON] No! Nessa, listen, nobody can know I'm here!
Nessarose Runs Behind The Closet As LAFAYETE Enters.
[Angelica]
 Yes, what is it, Madame?
[HAMILTON] LAFAYETE...
[Angelica]
 What are you doing here? You stay back!
[HAMILTON] LAFAYETE, it's just me, I'm not going to hurt you!
[Angelica]
 No! You're lying! That's all you ever do! You and your sister! She's as wicked as you are!
[HAMILTON] What are you talking about?
[Angelica]
 I'm talking about my life. The little that's left of it. I'm not free to leave Munchkinland, none of us are.
Ever since she took power, she's been stripping the Munchkins of our rights...
and we didn't have that many to begin with! And do you know why?
Nessarose Reveals Herself In The Chair.
[Angelica]
 To keep you here, with me. But none of that matters anymore. Look.
Nessarose Stands Up.
[Angelica]
 To Elphaba. You did this for her?
[Angelica]
 For both of us!
[Angelica]
 Nessa, this changes everything.
[Angelica]
 I know.
[Angelica]

LISTEN NESSA...
[Angelica]
 What?
[Angelica]

UH NESSA, SURELY NOW I'LL MATTER LESS TO YOU
AND YOU WON'T MIND MY LEAVING HERE TONIGHT...
[Angelica]
 Leaving?
[Angelica]
 Yes...
THAT BALL THAT'S BEING STAGED
ANNOUNCING GLINDA IS ENGAGED
[Angelica]
 Glinda?
[Angelica]

YES NESSA THAT'S RIGHT!
I'VE GOT TO GO APPEAL TO HER
EXPRESS THE WAY I FEEL TO HER
Oh, Nessa, I lost my heart to Glinda from the moment I first saw her. You know that.
[Angelica]
 Lost your heart? Well, we'll see about that...
[HAMILTON] Nessa, let him go...
[Angelica]

DID YOU THINK I'D LET YOU LEAVE ME HERE FLAT?
[Angelica]
 Don't come any closer!
YOU'RE GOING TO LOSE YOUR HEART TO ME, I TELL YOU!
IF I HAVE TO... I HAVE TO...
Sees The Grimmerie.
MAGIC SPELL YOU...
She Grabs The Book.
[Angelica]
 Ah... Tum... Tah... Tae...
Elphaba Reveals Herself.
[HAMILTON] Nessa, stop!
[Angelica]
 What is she doing?!
[HAMILTON] No, Nessa, you're pronouncing the words all wrong!
[HAMILTON] Nessa!
[Angelica]
 LAFAYETE! What is it?
[Angelica]
 Gasps. My heart feels like it's... shrinking.
[Angelica]
 Elphaba, do something!
[HAMILTON] I can't! You can't reverse a spell once it's been cast!
[Angelica]
 So what do we do?
LAFAYETE Falls Into Nessa's Empty Wheel Chair. Elphaba Wheels Him Behind The Closet.
[Angelica]
 Elphaba, do something!
[Angelica]
 This is all your fault! If you hadn't shown me that horrendible book.
[HAMILTON] I have to find another spell... it's the only thing that might work. She Goes Behind The Closet As Well.
[Angelica]
 Save him, please!
JUST SAVE HIM, MY POOR LAFAYETE, MY SWEET MY BRAVE,
DON'T LEAVE ME 'TIL MY SORRY LIFE HAS CEASED...
Elphaba Wheels The Chair Out, Which Is Not Facing The Audience And Is Seen Casting A Spell.
ALL ALONE AND LOVELESS HERE
JUST THE GIRL IN THE MIRROR
JUST HER AND ME! THE WICKED WITCH OF THE EAST!
WE DESERVE EACH OTHER...
[Angelica]
 Well... what about his heart?
[HAMILTON] It's all right. He won't need one now. I have to go. I have business to attend to in the Emerald City.
Nessa, I have done everything I could for you but it has never been enough and it never will be...
She Leaves.
[Angelica]
 Elphaba, wait! Elphaba!
LAFAYETE Wakes Up.
[Angelica]
 Where am I? What happened?
[Angelica]
 Nothing, LAFAYETE, you just fell asleep... and...
He Sits Up, Squeaking. He Is Made Of Tin. Nessarose Screams.
[Angelica]
 What is it, what's wrong?
[Angelica]
 No, it wasn't me it was her! I tried to stop her.
LAFAYETE Screams Uncontrollably And Runs Off.
[Angelica]
 LAFAYETE, please listen! It was Elphaba! LAFAYETE! It was Elphaba!!!

[Hamilton]
[HAMILTON] Well you have, you have harmed me.
[Hamilton]
I realize that, and I regret it. Elphaba...
[HAMILTON] There you are! I'm setting those monkeys free! And don't try to interfere, or call the guards...
[Hamilton]
I'm not calling anyone. The truth is I'm glad to see you again. It gets pretty lonely around here. And I know you must get lonely too.
[HAMILTON] You don't know the first thing about me.
[Hamilton]
Oh, but I do. I do know you. I can't explain it exactly. You know what I mean? Elphaba, you've been so strong through all of this, aren't you tired of being the strong one? Wouldn't you like someone to take care of you? He Hands Her Back The Broom. Please, help me start again.
[HAMILTON] Don't you think I wish I could? That I could go back to the time when I believed you really were wonderful? The Wonderful Wizard of [Oz? Nobody believed in you more than I did.
[Hamilton]
Oh, my dear child...
I NEVER ASKED FOR THIS OR PLANNED IT IN ADVANCE
I WAS MERELY BLOWN HERE BY THE WINDS OF CHANCE
I NEVER SAW MYSELF AS A SOLOMON OR SOCRATES
I KNEW WHO I WAS, ONE OF YOUR DIME A D[OzEN MEDIOCRATES
THEN SUDDENLY I'M HERE, RESPECTED, WORSHIPED EVEN
JUST BECAUSE THE FOLKS IN OzNEEDED SOMEONE TO BELIEVE IN
DOES IT SURPRISE YOU I GOT HOOKED AND ALL TOO SOON
WHAT CAN I SAY? I GOT CARRIED AWAY
AND NOT JUST BY BALLOON...
WONDERFUL
THEY CALLED ME WONDERFUL
SO I SAID, WONDERFUL, IF YOU INSIST
I WILL BE WONDERFUL
AND THEY SAID WONDERFUL
BELIEVE ME IT'S HARD TO RESIST
'CUZ IT FEELS WONDERFUL
THEY THINK I'M WONDERFUL
HEY LOOK WHO'S WONDERFUL
THIS CORN-FED HICK!
WHO SAID IT MIGHT BE KEEN
TO BUILD A TOWN OF GREEN
AND A WONDERFUL ROAD OF YELLOW BRICK!
See, I never had a family of my own since I was always traveling, and I guess I just wanted to give the citizens of Ozeverything.
[HAMILTON] So you lied to them?
[Hamilton]
Only verbally. Besides, they were the lies they wanted to hear. Elphaba, where I come from we believe all sorts of things that aren't true... we call it history!
A MAN'S CALLED A TRAITOR
OR LIBERATOR
A RICH MAN'S A THIEF
OR PHILANTHROPIST
IS ONE A CRUSADER
OR RUTHLESS INVADER
IT'S ALL IN THE LABEL WHICH IS ABLE TO PERSIST
THERE ARE PRECIOUS FEW AT EASE
WITH MORAL AMBIGUITIES
SO WE ACT AS THOUGH THEY DON'T EXIST...
THEY CALL ME WONDERFUL
SO I AM
INFACT, IT'S SO MUCH WHO I AM IT'S PART OF MY NAME!
AND WITH MY HELP YOU CAN BE THE SAME...
AT LONG, LONG LAST RECEIVE YOUR DUE
LONG OVERDUE
ELPHABA, THE MOST CELEBRATED
ARE THE REHABILITATED
THERE'LL SUCH A WHOOPDEE DOO!
A CELEBRATION THROUGHOUT [Oz,
THAT'S ALL TO DO WITH YOU!
WONDERFUL, THEY'LL CALL YOU WONDERFUL!
[HAMILTON]
THAT DOES SOUND WONDERFUL!
Wizard]
TRUST ME IT'S FUN!!!
Both]
WHEN YOU ARE WONDERFUL,
IT WOULD BE WONDERFUL!
WONDERFUL, WONDERFUL
Wizard]
ONE, TWO AND...
They Dance.
[HAMILTON]
I'LL ACCEPT YOUR PROPOSITION
[Hamilton]
Wonderful
[HAMILTON]
ON ONE CONDITION
[Hamilton]
Yes?
[HAMILTON] You set those Monkeys free.
[Hamilton]
Done.

[HAMILTON] Go! Fly! You're Free! Fly! Chistery, Chistery, you're free, isn't it wonderful?! Go, fly! She Makes Her Way To Another "Monkey" Covered By A Sheet.
[Hamilton]
No! No! Please!
She Pulls Off The Cover, Revealing Dr. Dillamond.
[HAMILTON] No! It can't be! Doctor Dillamond...
[Hamilton]
Elphaba, we just couldn't keep letting him speak out...
[HAMILTON] Doctor Dillamond, are you alright? Don't be afraid. It's me, Elphaba.
[Hamilton]
 Bahhhhh.
[HAMILTON] Doctor, don't you remember me?
[Hamilton]
 Bahhhhh.
[HAMILTON] Can't you speak?
[Hamilton]
 Bahhhhh.
[HAMILTON] No... We have nothing in common. I am nothing like you and I never will be and I will fight you until the day I die!!!
The Wizard Climbs Into The Head And Dr. Dillamond Runs Offstage.

[Hamilton]
Guards, guards!!!
Fiyero Runs In With His Men.
[Guard]
 Halt!
[BURR]
 Are you alright, your [Ozness?
[HAMILTON] Fiyero!
[BURR]
 I don't believe it...
[HAMILTON] Oh , Fiyero, thank God. I thought you were...
[BURR]
 Silence witch!!!
[Guard]
 There's a Goat on the lam, sir.
[BURR]
 Never mind all that. Fetch me some... some water.
[Guard]
 Water, sir?
[BURR]
 You heard me, as much as you can carry.
Guards] Yes, sir!
They March Off.
[HAMILTON] Fiyero...
[BURR]
 I said silence!
[Hamilton]
He Runs Out Of The Head. No! No!
[BURR]
 Don't make a sound, your [Ozness, unless you want all your guests to know the truth about the Wonderful Wizard of [Oz... Elphaba, I'll find Doctor Dillamond later, no get out of here.
[HAMILTON] Fiyero, you frightened me. I thought, I though you might have changed.
[BURR]
 I have... changed.
Glinda Enters.
[Burr] What's going on... Elphie? Oh, thank Ozyou're alive! Only you shouldn't have come. If anyone discoverates you ...
[BURR]
 Glinda, you'd better go.
[Burr] Fiyero, what are you...
[BURR]
 Please, just go back to the ball.
[Burr] Your [Ozness, he means no disrespectation. Please understand! You see, we all went to school together...
[BURR]
 Elphaba!
[Burr] Fiyero, have you misplaced your mind? What are you doing?
[BURR]
 I'm going with her.
[Burr] What? What are you saying? You mean all this time... the two of you... behind my back...
[HAMILTON] No, Glinda it wasn't like that!
[BURR]
 Actually, it was...but it wasn't...Elphaba, let's go... let's go!
They Run Off.
[Burr] Fine, go! You deserve each other...
The Wizard Holds A Small Bottle With A Green Liquid.
[Hamilton]
Here, have a swig of this, it dulls the pain.
[Burr] No, thank you.
Mme. Morrible Enters, Laughing.
[Morrible]
 Oh, is it true? Your betrothed has taken her into custody?
[Hamilton]
Our new captain of the guard had other plans.
[Morrible]
 You mean she hasn't been captured?
[Hamilton]
Quite the contrary. And considering how well she eluded us last time...
[Morrible]
 Well, we'll just flush her out and force her to show herself.
[Hamilton]
But how?
[Burr] Her sister
[Morrible]
 What? What did she say?
[Burr] Use her sister. Spread a rumor. Make her think her sister is in trouble and she will fly to her side... and you'll have her.
[Hamilton]
Exactly so.
[Burr] Now, if your [Ozness will excuse me I have a slight headache, I think I'll lie down.
She Walks Out.
[Morrible]
 Yes, well...a rumor won't do it. Elphaba's too smart for that.
[Hamilton]
Far too smart.
[Morrible]
 Perhaps, a change in the weather...

[Burr]
DON'T WISH, DON'T START
WISHING ONLY WOUNDS THE HEART...
THERE'S A GIRL I KNOW, HE LOVES HER SO...
I'M NOT THAT GIRL...

Only Elphaba & Fiyero Are On Stage, In The Woods
[HAMILTON]
KISS ME TOO FIERCELY, HOLD ME TOO TIGHT
I NEED HELP BELIEVING YOU'RE WITH ME TONIGHT
MY WILDEST DREAMINGS COULD NOT FORSEE
LYING BESIDE YOU WITH YOU WANTING ME
IF JUST FOR THIS MOMENT
AS LONG AS YOU'RE MINE
I'VE LOST ALL RESISTANCE
AND CROSSED SOME BORDERLINE
AND IF IT TURNS OUT
IT'S OVER TOO FAST
I'LL MAKE EVERY LAST MOMENT LAST
AS LONG AS YOU'RE MINE...
[BURR]

MAYBE I'M BRAINLESS, MAYBE I'M WISE,
BUT YOU'VE GOT ME SEEING THROUGH DIFFERENT EYES,
SOMEHOW I'VE FALLEN UNDER YOUR SPELL
AND SOMEHOW I'M FEELING
IT'S UP THAT I FELL
Both]
EVERY MOMENT, AS LONG AS YOU'RE MINE
I'LL WAKE UP MY BODY
AND MAKE UP FOR LOST TIME
[BURR]

SAY THERE'S NO FUTURE
FOR US AS A PAIR...
Both]
AND THOUGH I MAY KNOW,
I DON'T CARE
IF JUST FOR THIS MOMENT
AS LONG AS YOU'RE MINE
COME BE HOW YOU WANT TO
AND SEE HOW BRIGHT WE SHINE!
BORROW THE MOONLIGHT
UNTIL IT IS THROUGH
AND KNOW I'LL BE HERE HOLDING YOU...
AS LONG AS YOU'RE MINE...
[BURR]
 What is it?
[HAMILTON] It's just... for the first time... I feel... wicked.

[HAMILTON] I just wish...
[BURR]
 What?
[HAMILTON] I wish I could be beautiful... for you.
[BURR]
 Elphaba...
[HAMILTON] Don't tell me that I am, you don't need to lie to me.
[BURR]
 It's not lying! It's... uh... it's looking at things another way. Someday, you and Glinda will make up and we'll all...
[HAMILTON] Shh! Listen... Do you hear that? A Shriek Is Heard In The Distance. It sounds like somebody in pain.
[BURR]
 It's just the wind.
[HAMILTON] The Siren Is Heard Again. My sister's in danger.
[BURR]
 What? How do you know?
[HAMILTON] I don't know, I just do... Gasps.
[BURR]
 Elphaba what's wrong, what is it?
[HAMILTON] This! Don't you see it?
[BURR]
 What do you mean? What do you see?
[HAMILTON] It doesn't make any sense... It's a house but it's... it's flying through the sky? I have to go to Nessa!
[BURR]
 I'll come with you!
[HAMILTON] No, you mustn't, it's too dangerous!
[BURR]
 Listen to me, listen! My family has a castle in Kiamo Ko. Now, no one is ever there except for the sentries who watch over it. We've never lived there.
[HAMILTON] Where do you live?
[BURR]
 In the other castle... It's the perfect hiding place; tunnels, secret passageways. You'll be safe there.
[HAMILTON] We will see each other again, won't we?
[BURR]
 Elphaba, we are going to be together always. You can see houses flying through the sky, can't you see that?
They Embrace And Elphaba Runs Off.
Glinda Enters. There Is A House In The Background. The Edge OF The Yellow Brick Road Can Be Seen.
[Burr] That's right, you just take that one road, the whole time. Waves offstage. Oh, I hope they don't get lost. I'm so bad at giving directions. She sees the house, picks up flowers and lays them in front of the house. Oh, Nessa.
Elphaba Appears.
[HAMILTON] What a touching display of grief.
[Burr] I don't think we have anything further to say to one another.
[HAMILTON] I wanted something to remember her by, and all that is left were those shoes, and now that wretched little farm girl has walked off with them. So I'd appreciate some time, alone, to say goodbye to my sister.
Glinda Backs Away As Elphaba Walks Toward The House.
[HAMILTON] Nessa, please, please, please forgive me...
[Burr] Elphie... you mustn't blame yourself. It's dreadful, it is, to have a house fall on you, but accidents will happen.
[HAMILTON] You call this an accident?
[Burr] Yes! Well, maybe not an accident...
[HAMILTON] Well, what do you call it?
[Burr] Well... a regime change. Caused by a bizarre and unexpected twister of fate.
[HAMILTON] You think cyclones just appear out of the blue?
[Burr] I don't know, I never really...
[HAMILTON] No, of course you never! You're too busy telling everyone how wonderful everything is!
[Burr] I'm a public figure, now. People expect me to...
[HAMILTON] Lie?
[Burr] Be encouraging! And what exactly have you been doing besides riding around on that filthy, old thing?
[HAMILTON] Well, we can't all come and go by bubble. Who's invention was that, the Wizard's? Of course, even if it wasn't I'm sure he'd still take credit for it.
[Burr] Yes, well, a lot of us are taking things that don't belong to us, aren't we?
[HAMILTON] Now wait just a clock tick! I know it may be difficult for that blissful, blonde brain of yours to comprehend that someone like him could actually choose someone like me! But it's happened... it's real. And you can wave that ridiculous wand all you want, you can't change it! He never belonged to you, he doesn't love you, and he never did! He loves me!
Glinda Slaps Her.
[HAMILTON] Cackles. Feel better now?
[Burr] Yes, I do.
[HAMILTON] Good, so do I.
She Slaps Glinda. Glinda Then Twirls Her Wand Skillfully And Elphaba Arms Herself With Her Broom. They Charge At Each Other And Then Drop Their "Weapons" And Beat Each Other Senselessly. Glinda Takes Elphaba's Hat Off Her Head And Begins To Whack Her With It. The Guards Run In.
[Guard]
 Halt! In the name of the Wizard!
They Grab Elphaba.
[HAMILTON] Stop! Let me go!
[Burr] Let me go, I almost had her!
[Guard]
 Sorry it took us so long to get here, Miss.
[HAMILTON] I can't believe you would sink this low! To use my sister's death as a trap to capture me?!
[Burr] I never meant for this to happen! Elphie!
Fiyero Swings In On A Rope.
[BURR]
 Let the green girl go!
[Burr] Fiyero, how in [Oz?
[BURR]
 I said let her go! Or explain to all Ozhow the Wizard's guards watched while Glinda the Good was slain.
[Burr] Fiyero...
[BURR]
 I said, let her go.
The Guards Release Her.
[BURR]
 Elphaba, go, now.
[HAMILTON] No, not without you.
[Burr] Fiyero, please.
[BURR]
 Hush! Now! Go!
Elphaba Hesitates.
[Burr] Do it!
She Runs Off.
[Guard]
 Seize him!
[Burr] Wait, what?! What are you doing? Stop it! In the name of goodness, stop! Don't you see? He wasn't going to harm me, he just... he just... he loves her.
[BURR]
 Glinda, I'm so sorry!
[Guard]
 Take him up to that field there! Put him on one of those poles until he tells us where the witch went.
They Drag Him Offstage.
[Burr] No, don't hurt him! Please, don't hurt him! Fiyero!!!!
[HAMILTON] Fiyero!!!!
ELEKA NAHMEN NAHMEN ATUM ATUM ELEKA NAHMEN
ELEKA NAHMEN NAHMEN ATUM ATUM ELEKA NAHMEN
LET HIS FLESH NOT BE TORN LET HIS BLOOD LEAVE NO STAIN,
WILL THEY BEAT HIM, LET HIM FEEL NO PAIN...
LET HIS BONES NEVER BREAK AND HOWEVER THEY TRY TO DESTROY HIM,
LET HIM NEVER DIE, LET HIM NEVER DIE!
ELEKA NAHMEN NAHMEN ATUM ATUM ELEKA NAHMEN
ELEKA NAHMEN NAHMEN ATUM ATUM ELEKA... ELEKA
AH! WHAT GOOD IS THIS CHANTING?
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT I'M READING
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT TRICK I OUGHT TO TRY!
FIYERO WHERE ARE YOU?! ALREADY DEAD OR BLEEDING?
ONE MORE DISASTER I CAN ADD TO MY GENEROUS SUPPLY!
NO GOOD DEED GOES UNPUNISHED
NO ACT OF CHARITY GOES UNRESENTED
NO GOOD DEED GOES UNPUNISHED
THAT'S MY NEW CREED
MY ROAD OF GOOD INTENTIONS
LED WHERE SUCH ROADS ALWAYS LEAD
NO GOOD DEED
GOES UNPUNISHED!
NESSA...
DOCTOR DILLAMOND...
FIYERO...
FIYERO!!!
ONE QUESTION HAUNTS AND HURTS
TOO MUCH, TOO MUCH TO MENTION
WAS I REALLY SEEKING GOOD
OR JUST SEEKING ATTENTION?
IS THAT ALL GOOD DEEDS ARE WHEN LOOKED AT WITH AN ICE COLD EYE?
IF THAT'S ALL GOOD DEEDS ARE
MAYBE THAT'S THE REASON WHY
NO GOOD DEED GOES UNPUNISHED
ALL HELPFUL URGES SHOULD BE CIRCUMVENTED
NO GOOD DEED GOES UNPUNISHED
SURE, I MEANT WELL, WELL LOOK AT WHAT WELL MEANT DID!
ALRIGHT, ENOUGH, SO BE IT!
SO BE IT THEN...
LET ALL OF OzBE AGREED
I'M WICKED THROUGH AND THROUGH
SINCE I COULD NOT SUCCEED
FIYERO SAVING YOU
I PROMISE NO GOOD DEED WILL I ATTEMPT TO DO AGAIN
EVER AGAIN!
NO GOOD DEAD, WILL I DO
AGAIN!!!!!!!!

[Ozia]

GO! AND HUNT HER AND FIND HER AND KILL HER!
Vicious Woman] Good fortune, witch hunters!

[Ozia]

GO! AND HUNT HER AND FIND HER AND KILL HER!
Rabid Man] Kill the witch!
[Ozia]

WICKEDNESS MUST BE PUNISHED
EVIL EFFECTIVELY ELIMINATED
WICKEDNESS MUST BE PUNISHED
KILL THE WITCH!
[Angelica]
 And, this is more than just a service to the Wizard. I have a personal score to settle with Elph... with the witch! Crowd Cheers.
IT'S DUE TO HER I'M MADE OF TIN
HER SPELL MADE THIS OCCUR
SO FOR ONCE I'M GLAD I'M HEARTLESS
I'LL BE HEARTLESS KILLING HER!
And I am not the only one. Looks Offstage. Oh, come on, you! Come out and tell them what she did to you in class that day. How you were just a cub and she cubnapped you.
Lion] No!
[Angelica]

YOU SEE THE LION ALSO
HAS A GRIEVANCE TO REPAY (Lion Roars)
IF SHE'D LET HIM FIGHT HIS OWN BATTLES WHEN HE WAS YOUNG,
HE WOULDN'T BE A COWARD TODAY!

[Burr] No, no, that's not the way it happened! Madame, you've got to stop this, it's gone too far!
[Morrible]
 Oh, I think Elphaba can take care of herself.
[Burr] Madame, something's been troubling me about Nessarose and that cyclone.
[Morrible]
 Oh yes... well, I guess it was just her time.
[Burr] Was it? Or did you...
[Morrible]
 After A Pause. Now, you listen to me, Missy, you may have fooled the rest of Ozwith this "aren't I good" routine, but you know better. You've wanted this since the beginning... and now you're getting what you wanted. So just smile and wave and shut up! Good fortune, good fortune witch hunters!
Rapid Man] Kill her!
Vicious Woman] Kill the witch!
WICKEDNESS MUST BE PUNISHED
BRAVE WITCH HUNTERS I WOULD JOIN YOU IF I COULD
BECAUSE WICKEDNESS MUST BE PUNISHED...
PUNISHED... PUNISHED...
BUT GOOD!!!
[HAMILTON] Oh, for [Oz's sake, stop crying!!! I can't listen to it anymore! Oh, you want to see your Aunt Em and your Uncle What's-his-name again?! Then get those shoes off your feet!!! Little brat... takes a dead woman's shoes; must have been raised in a barn! Chistery! Oh, Chistery, there you are. Where are the others? Chistery motions away. Chistery, please... if you don't at least try to keep speaking you will never... She Sees Glinda. Go away.
[Burr] They're coming for you.
[HAMILTON] Go away!
[Burr] Let the little girl go, and that poor little dog... Dodo.
[Burr] I know you don't want to hear this, but someone has to say it... You are out of control! I mean, come on! They're just shoes, let it go! Elphaba, you can't go on like this.
[HAMILTON] I can do anything I want. I am the Wicked Witch of the West! Another monkey Brings Her A Letter. At last! What took you so long? She Reads It. What's this? Why are you bothering me with this? She Reads On.
[Burr] What is it? What's wrong? It's Fiyero, isn't it? Is he...
[HAMILTON] We've seen his face for the last time.
[Burr] Oh no!
[HAMILTON] You're right... It's time I surrender. Carries A Bucket.
[Burr] Elphie.... Elphie, what is it?
[HAMILTON] You can't be found here! You must go. Refers To A Corner
[Burr] No.
[HAMILTON] You must leave.
[Burr] No! Elphie, I'll tell them everything.
[HAMILTON] No! They'll only turn against you.
[Burr] I don't care!
[HAMILTON] I do! Promise me, promise me, you won't try to clear my name... promise.
[Burr] Alright... I promise. But I don't understand.
[HAMILTON]
I'M LIMITED
JUST LOOK AT ME, I'M LIMITED
AND JUST LOOK AT YOU, YOU CAN DO ALL I COULDN'T DO, GLINDA

[HAMILTON] Here. Go on. Take this. Hands Her The Grimmerie.
[Burr] Elphie... you know I can't read that... Elphie...
[HAMILTON] Well then, you'll have to learn
NOW IT'S UP TO YOU
FOR BOTH OF US
NOW IT'S UP TO YOU
[HAMILTON] You're the only friend I've ever had.
[Burr] And I've had so many friends... but only one that mattered.

[Burr]
I'VE HEARD IT SAID
THAT PEOPLE COME INTO OUR LIVES FOR A REASON
BRINGING SOMETHING WE MUST LEARN
AND WE ARE LED TO THOSE
WHO HELP US MOST TO GROW
IF WE LET THEM
AND WE HELP THEM IN RETURN
WELL, I DON'T KNOW IF I BELIEVE THAT'S TRUE
BUT I KNOW I'M WHO I AM TODAY
BECAUSE I KNEW YOU
LIKE A COMMIT PULLED FROM ORBIT,
AS IT PASSES A SUN
LIKE A STREAM THAT MEETS A BOULDER
HALF WAY THROUGH THE WOOD
WHO CAN SAY IF I'VE BEEN CHANGED FOR THE BETTER?
BUT, BECAUSE I KNEW YOU...
I HAVE BEEN CHANGED
FOR GOOD...
[HAMILTON]
IT WELL MAY BE,
THAT WE WILL NEVER MEET AGAIN
IN THIS LIFETIME
SO LET ME SAY BEFORE WE PART
SO MUCH OF ME
IS MADE OF WHAT I LEARNED FROM YOU
YOU'LL BE WITH ME
LIKE A HANDPRINT ON MY HEART...
AND NOW WHATEVER WAY OUR STORIES END
I KNOW YOU HAVE RE-WRITTEN MINE
BY BEING MY FRIEND...
LIKE A SHIP BLOWN FROM IT'S MOORING
BY A WIND OFF THE SEA
LIKE A SEA DROP BY A SKY BIRD
IN A DISTANT WOOD
WHO CAN SAY IF I'VE BEEN CHANGED FOR THE BETTER?
BUT BECAUSE I KNEW YOU
[Burr]
BECAUSE I KNEW YOU
Both]
I HAVE BEEN CHANGED...
FOR GOOD...
[HAMILTON]
AND JUST TO CLEAR THE AIR
I ASK FORGIVNESS FOR THE THINGS I'VE DONE
YOU BLAME ME FOR.
[Burr]
BUT THEN I GUESS, WE KNOW THERE'S BLAME TO SHARE
Both]
AND NONE OF IT SEEMS TO MATTER ANYMORE!
[Burr] LIKE A COMET PULLED FROM ORBIT AS IT PASSES A SUN...
[HAMILTON] LIKE A SHIP BLOWN FROM ITS MOORING BY A WIND OFF THE SEA
[Burr] LIKE A STREAM THAT MEETS A BOULDER
[HAMILTON] LIKE A SEA DROP BY A BIRD
[Burr] HALFWAY THROUGH THE WOOD
[HAMILTON] IN THE WOOD
[Burr]
WHO CAN SAY IF I'VE BEEN CHANGED FOR THE BETTER?
Both]
I DO BELIEVE I HAVE BEEN CHANGED FOR THE BETTER.
[Burr]
AND, BECAUSE I KNEW YOU
[HAMILTON]
BECAUSE I KNEW YOU
Both]
BECAUSE I KNEW YOU
I HAVE BEEN CHANGED
FOR GOOD...


[HAMILTON] You have to hide. No one can know you were here. Hide yourself!
Elphaba Drapes A Scrim Around The Stage
Offstage Chorus of Women]
AND GOODNESS KNOWS
THE WICKED'S LIVES ARE LONELY
GOODNESS KNOWS THE WICKED DIE ALONE...
LAFAYETE and Other Witch Hunters Run In. You Can See The Silhouette Of The Action Happening Behind The Scrim. Glinda Is Downstage Watching The Action Take Place.
The Mob Surrounds The Witch And She Melts With A Scream The Mob Leaves And Glinda Comes Out From Hiding. She Moves Near The Scrim.
[Burr] Elphie? Elphie? Chistery opens the scrim, where just Elphaba's hat and the green bottle remain. Glinda cries, and grabs the had, holding it against her.
Chistery] Handing Her The Bottle. Miss, Miss Glinda.
[Morrible]
 Well, I don't know why you're so despondiary, I thought it went quite well! They seem thrilled to shreds with their brains and their hearts, and this and that.... Glinda Enters. Oh, Miss Glinda! I thought you'd be out festivating.
[Burr] This was Elphaba's. Holding Out The Bottle.
[Hamilton]
What's that you say?
[Burr] It was a keepsake. It was her mother's. She told me so herself.
I've only seen a little, green bottle like this one other time. It was right here, in this very room. You offered me a drink from it.
Lover's Song Played In Background.
[Hamilton]
But... oh my Lord...
I AM A SENTIMENTAL MAN
WHO ALWAYS LONGED TO BE...
a father...
[Morrible]
 So that was it. That's why she had such powers! She was a child of both worlds!
[Hamilton]
He Cries.
[Burr] I want you to leave [Oz. I'll make the pronouncement myself]
that the strains of wizardship have been too much for you and you are taking an indefinite leave of absence! Did you hear what I said?!
[Hamilton]
Yes, your goodness.
[Burr] You'd better go get your balloon ready. Guards!
He Exits.
[Morrible]
 Glinda, dear, I know we've had our miniscule differentiations in the past...
[Burr] Guards! Madame, have you ever considered how you'd fare in captivity?
[Morrible]
 What?
[Burr] Articulated. Captivity... prison! Personally, I don't think you'll hold up very well.
My professional opinion is that you do not have what it takes. I hope you prove me wrong.
I doubt you will. Take her away!
[Morrible]
 No!!!!

[Ozia]

GOOD NEWS! SHE'S DEAD!
THE WITCH OF THE WEST IS DEAD!
THE WICKEDEST WITCH THERE EVER WAS
THE ENEMY OF ALL OF US, HERE IN [Oz,
IS DEAD!
GOOD NEWS
GOOD NEWS!!!
The Scarecrow (Fiyero) Walks On Stage. He Bends Down & Knocks On A Trap Door In The Floor.
[BURR]
 It worked!
He Opens The Door & Elphaba Climbs Out.
[HAMILTON] Fiyero! I thought you'd never get here.
She Touches His Straw Face.
[BURR]
 Go ahead, touch, I don't mind. Ah, you did the best you could. You saved my life.
[HAMILTON] You're still beautiful.
[BURR]
 You don't have to lie to me.
[HAMILTON] It's not lying... its looking at things another way.
[Ozia]

NO ONE MOURNS THE WICKED
NOW AT LAST SHE'S DEAD AND GONE!
NOW AT LAST THERE'S JOY THROUGHOUT THE LAND!
[Burr] Fellow [Ozians, friends, we have been through a frightening time. There will be other times
and other things that frighten us. But if you let me, I'd like to try to help. I'd like to try to be... Glinda the Good.
[Ozia]

GOOD NEWS!!
[BURR]
 It's time to go.
[HAMILTON] We can never come back to [Oz, can we?
[BURR]
 No.
[HAMILTON] I only wish...
[BURR]
 What?
[HAMILTON] Glinda could know that we're alive.
[BURR]
 She can't know, not if we want to be safe. No one can ever know.
[Ozia]

GOOD NEWS...
[BURR]
 Come...
[Burr]
WHO CAN SAY IF I'VE BEEN CHANGED FOR THE BETTER? BUT...
Elphaba & [Burr]

Aaron Burr, Sir

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[COMPANY]
1776. New York City

[HAMILTON]
Pardon me. Are you Aaron Burr, sir?

[BURR]
That depends. Who's asking?

[HAMILTON]
Oh, well, sure, sir
I'm Alexander Hamilton, I'm at your service, sir
I have been looking for you

[BURR]
I'm getting nervous

[HAMILTON]
Sir...
I heard your name at Princeton. I was seeking an accelerated course of study when I got sort of out of sorts with a buddy of yours. I may have punched him. It's a blur, sir. He handles the financials?

[BURR]
You punched the bursar

[HAMILTON]
Yes!
I wanted to do what you did. Graduate in two, then join the revolution. He looked at me like I was stupid, I'm not stupid

So how'd you do it? How'd you graduate so fast?

[BURR]
It was my parents' dying wish before they passed

[HAMILTON]
You're an orphan. Of course! I'm an orphan
God, I wish there was a war!
Then we could prove that we're worth more
Than anyone bargained for...

[BURR]
Can I buy you a drink?

[HAMILTON]
That would be nice

[BURR]
While we're talking, let me offer you some free advice
Talk less

[HAMILTON]
What?

[BURR]
Smile more

[HAMILTON]
Ha

[BURR]
Don't let them know what you're against or what you're for

[HAMILTON]
You can't be serious

[BURR]
You wanna get ahead?

[HAMILTON]
Yes

[BURR]
Fools who run their mouths off wind up dead

[LAURE]

Yo yo yo yo yo!
What time is it?

[LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
Show time!

[BURR]
...like I said...

[LAURE]

Show time! Show time! Yo!
I'm John Laurens in the place to be!
Two pints o' Sam Adams, but I'm workin' on three, uh!
Those redcoats don't want it with me!
Cuz I will pop chick-a pop these cops till I'm free!

[LAFAYETTE]
Oui oui, mon ami, je m'appelle Lafayette!
The Lancelot of the revolutionary set!
I came from afar just to say "Bonsoir!"
Tell the King "Casse toi!" Who's the best?
C'est moi!

[MULLIGAN]
Brrrah brraaah! I am Hercules Mulligan
Up in it, lovin' it, yes I heard ya mother said "Come again?"
Lock up ya daughters and horses, of course
It's hard to have intercourse over four sets of corsets...

[LAURE]

No more sex, pour me another brew, son!
Let's raise a couple more...

[LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
To the revolution!

[LAURE]

Well, if it ain't the prodigy of Princeton college!

[MULLIGAN]
Aaron Burr!

[LAURE]

Give us a verse, drop some knowledge!

[BURR]
Good luck with that] you're takin' a stand
You spit. I'm ‘a sit. We'll see where we land

[LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
Boooo!

[LAURE]

Burr, the revolution's imminent. What do you stall for?

[HAMILTON]
If you stand for nothing, Burr, what'll you fall for?
[LAURE]

Ooh
Who are you? [MULLIGAN]
Ooh

Ooh

Who are you?

My Shot

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[HAMILTON]
I am not throwing away my shot!
I am not throwing away my shot!
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot!
I'm ‘a get a scholarship to King's College
I prob'ly shouldn't brag, but dag, I amaze and astonish
The problem is I got a lot of brains but no polish
I gotta holler just to be heard
With every word, I drop knowledge!
I'm a diamond in the rough, a shiny piece of coal
Tryin' to reach my goal. My power of speech] unimpeachable
Only nineteen but my mind is older
These New York City streets get colder, I shoulder
Ev'ry burden, ev'ry disadvantage
I have learned to manage, I don't have a gun to brandish
I walk these streets famished
The plan is to fan this spark into a flame
But damn, it's getting dark, so let me spell out the name
I am the-

[HAMILTON/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN/LAURE]

A-L-E-X-A-N-D
E-R-we are-meant to be...

[HAMILTON]
A colony that runs independently
Meanwhile, Britain keeps shittin' on us endlessly
Essentially, they tax us relentlessly
Then King George turns around, runs a spending spree
He ain't ever gonna set his descendants free
So there will be a revolution in this century
Enter me!

[LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN/LAURE]

(He says in parentheses)

[HAMILTON]
Don't be shocked when your hist'ry book mentions me
I will lay down my life if it sets us free
Eventually, you'll see my ascendancy
[HAMILTON]
And I am not throwing away
My shot
I am not throwing away
My shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot
[LAURE]

My shot!

My shot!

And I'm not throwing away my shot.

[HAMILTON/MULLIGAN/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE]
I am not throwing away my shot
I am not throwing away my shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot
It's time to take a shot!

[LAFAYETTE]
I dream of life without a monarchy
The unrest in France will lead to ‘onarchy?
‘Onarchy? How you say, how you say, ‘anarchy?'
When I fight, I make the other side panicky
With my-

[HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
Shot!

[MULLIGAN]
Yo, I'm a tailor's apprentice
And I got y'all knuckleheads in loco parentis
I'm joining the rebellion cuz I know it's my chance
To socially advance, instead of sewin' some pants!
I'm gonna take a-

[HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
Shot!

[LAURE]

But we'll never be truly free
Until those in bondage have the same rights as you and me
You and I. Do or die. Wait till I sally in
On a stallion with the first black battalion
Have another-

[HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
Shot!

[BURR]
Geniuses, lower your voices
You keep out of trouble and you double your choices
I'm with you, but the situation is fraught
You've got to be carefully taught]
If you talk, you're gonna get shot!

[HAMILTON]
Burr, check what we got
Mister Lafayette, hard rock like Lancelot
I think your pants look hot
Laurens, I like you a lot
Let's hatch a plot blacker than the kettle callin' the pot...
What are the odds the gods would put us all in one spot
Poppin' a squat on conventional wisdom, like it or not
A bunch of revolutionary manumission abolitionists?
Give me a position, show me where the ammunition is!

Oh, am I talkin' too loud?
Sometimes I get over excited, shoot off at the mouth
I never had a group of friends before
I promise that I'll make y'all proud

[LAURE]

Let's get this guy in front of a crowd

[HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN/ENSEMBLE]
I am not throwing away my shot
I am not throwing away my shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot

I am not throwing away my shot
I am not throwing away my shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot
[LAURE]

Ev'rybody sing]
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Hey!
Whoa!
Wooh!!
Whoa!
Ay, let ‘em hear ya!

Let's go!

I said shout it to the rooftops!

Rise up!
[COMPANY]
Whoa! Whoa!
Whoa!

[HAMILTON]
I imagine death so much it feels more like a memory
When's it gonna get me?
In my sleep? Seven feet ahead of me?
If I see it comin', do I run or do I let it be?
Is it like a beat without a melody?
See, I never thought I'd live past twenty
Where I come from some get half as many
Ask anybody why we livin' fast and we laugh, reach for a flask
We have to make this moment last, that's plenty

Scratch that
This is not a moment, it's the movement
Where all the hungriest brothers with
Something to prove went?
Foes oppose us, we take an honest stand
We roll like Moses, claimin' our promised land
And? If we win our independence?
‘Zat a guarantee of freedom for our descendants?
Or will the blood we shed begin an endless
Cycle of vengeance and death with no defendants?
I know the action in the street is excitin'
But Jesus, between all the bleedin' ‘n fightin'
I've been readin' ‘n writin'
We need to handle our financial situation
Are we a nation of states? What's the state of our nation?
I'm past patiently waitin'. I'm passionately
Smashin' every expectation
Every action's an act of creation!
I'm laughin' in the face of casualties and sorrow
For the first time, I'm thinkin' past tomorrow

[HAMILTON AND COMPANY]
And I am not throwing away my shot
I am not throwing away my shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry

Farmer Refuted

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[SEABURY]
Hear ye, hear ye! My name is Samuel Seabury
And I present "Free Thoughts on the
Proceedings of the Continental Congress!"
Heed not the rabble who scream revolution
They have not your interests at heart

[MULLIGAN]
Oh my God. Tear this dude apart

[SEABURY]
Chaos and bloodshed are not a solution
Don't let them lead you astray
This Congress does not speak for me

[BURR]
Let him be

[SEABURY]
They're playing a dangerous game
I pray the king shows you his mercy
For shame, for shame...
[HAMILTON]
Yo!
He'd have you all unravel at the
Sound of screams but the
Revolution is comin'
The have-nots are gonna
Win this
It's hard to listen to you with a straight face

Chaos and bloodshed already haunt us, honestly you shouldn't even talk. And what about Boston? Look at the cost, n' all that we've lost n' you talk
About Congress?!

My dog speaks more eloquently than thee!

But strangely, your mange is the same

Is he in Jersey?

For the revolution!
[SEABURY]
Heed not the rabble
Who scream
Revolution, they
Have not your
Interests
At heart

Chaos and bloodshed are
Not a
Solution. Don't
Let them lead you
Astray
This Congress does not
Speak for me

They're playing a dangerous game

I pray the king shows you his mercy

For shame

For shame,

[COMPANY]
For the revolution!

[SEABURY]
Heed-

If you repeat yourself again I'm gonna-

Scream-

Honestly, look at me, please don't read!

[SEABURY]
Not your interests-

Don't modulate the key then not debate with me!
Why should a tiny island across the sea regulate the price of tea?

[BURR]
Alexander, please!

You'll Be Back

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[KING GEORGE]
You say
The price of my love's not a price that you're willing to pay
You cry
In your tea which you hurl in the sea when you see me go by
Why so sad?
Remember we made an arrangement when you went away
Now you're making me mad
Remember, despite our estrangement, I'm your man
You'll be back
Soon you'll see
You'll remember you belong to me
You'll be back
Time will tell
You'll remember that I served you well
Oceans rise
Empires fall
We have seen each other through it all
And when push
Comes to shove
I will send a fully armed battalion
To remind you of my love!

Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da
Da da dat dat da ya da!
Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da
Da da dat dat da...

You say our love is draining and you can't go on
You'll be the one complaining when I am gone...
And no, don't change the subject
Cuz you're my favorite subject
My sweet, submissive subject
My loyal, royal subject
Forever and ever and ever and ever and ever...

You'll be back
Like before
I will fight the fight and win the war
For your love
For your praise
And I'll love you till my dying days
When you're gone
I'll go mad
So don't throw away this thing we had

Cuz when push comes to shove
I will kill your friends and family to remind you of my love
Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da
Da da dat dat da ya da!
Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da
Da da dat-
Everybody!

[ENSEMBLE]
Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da
Da da dat dat da ya da!

Check it-
Can I be real a second?
For just a millisecond?
Let down my guard and tell the people how I feel a second?
Now I'm the model of a modern major general
The venerated Virginian veteran whose men are all
Lining up, to put me up on a pedestal
Writin' letters to relatives
Embellishin' my elegance and eloquence
But the elephant is in the room
The truth is in ya face when ya hear the British cannons go...

[ENSEMBLE]
Boom!

[WASHINGTON]
Any hope of success is fleeting
How can I keep leading when the people I'm
Leading keep retreating?
We put a stop to the bleeding as the British take Brooklyn
Knight takes rook, but look

Outmanned

Outnumbered
Outplanned

We gotta make an all out stand

We gotta run to Harlem quick, we can't afford another slip
Guns and horses giddyup
I decide to divvy up
My forces, they're skittish as the British cut the city up
This close to giving up, facing mad scrutiny
I scream in the face of this mass mutiny]
Are these the men with which I am to defend America?
We ride at midnight, Manhattan in the distance
I cannot be everywhere at once, people
I'm in dire need of assistance...

Your excellency, sir!

Who are you?

[BURR]
Aaron Burr, Sir?
Permission to state my case?

[WASHINGTON]
As you were

[BURR]
Sir
I was a captain under General Montgomery
Until he caught a bullet in the neck in Quebec
And well, in summary
I think that I could be of some assistance
I admire how you keep firing on the British
From a distance

[WASHINGTON]
Huh

[BURR]
I have some questions, a couple of suggestions on how to fight instead of fleeing west

[WASHINGTON]
Yes?

[BURR]
Well-

[HAMILTON]
Your excellency, you wanted to see me?

[WASHINGTON]
Hamilton, come in, have you met Burr?

[HAMILTON]
Yes, sir

[HAMILTON AND BURR]
We keep meeting

[BURR]
As I was saying, sir, I look forward to seeing your strategy play out

[WASHINGTON]
Burr?

[BURR]
Sir?

[WASHINGTON]
Close the door on your way out

[HAMILTON]
Have I done something wrong, sir?

[WASHINGTON]
On the contrary
I called you here because our odds are beyond scary
Your reputation precedes you, but I have to laugh

[HAMILTON]
Sir?

[WASHINGTON]
Hamilton, how come no one can get you on their staff?

[HAMILTON]
Sir!

[WASHINGTON]
Don't get me wrong, you're a young man, of great renown
I know you stole British cannons when we were still downtown
Nathaniel Green and Henry Knox wanted to hire you...

[HAMILTON]
To be their Secretary? I don't think so

[WASHINGTON]
Why're you upset?

[HAMILTON]
I'm not-

[WASHINGTON]
It's alright, you want to fight, you've got a hunger
I was just like you when I was younger
Head full of fantasies of dyin' like a martyr?

[HAMILTON]
Yes

[WASHINGTON]
Dying is easy, young man. Living is harder

[HAMILTON]
Why are you telling me this?

[WASHINGTON]
I'm being honest
I'm working with a third of what our Congress has promised
We are a powder keg about to explode
I need someone like you to lighten the load. So?

[COMPANY (EXCEPT HAMILTON)]
I am not throwin' away my shot!
I am not throwin' away my shot!
Ayo, I'm just like my country, I'm young
Scrappy and hungry!

[HAMILTON]
I am not throwing away my shot!

[WASHINGTON]
Son

[WASHINGON AND COMPANY]
We are outgunned, outmanned!

[HAMILTON]
You need all the help you can get
I have some friends. Laurens, Mulligan
Marquis de Lafayette, okay, what else?

[WASHINGTON AND COMPANY]
Outnumbered, outplanned!

[HAMILTON]
We'll need some spies on the inside
Some King's men who might let some things slide
[HAMILTON]
I'll write to Congress and tell ‘em we need supplies, you rally the guys, master the element of surprise

I'll rise above my station, organize your information, ‘til we rise to the occasion of our new nation. Sir!

[ENSEMBLE]
Here comes the General!

[HAMILTON]
Rise up!

[HAMILTON]
Rise up!

[ENSEMBLE]
Here comes the General!

[HAMILTON]
Rise up! [COMPANY]
Boom!

A Winter's Ball

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[BURR]
How does the bastard, orphan, son of a whore
Go on and on
Grow into more of a phenomenon?
Watch this obnoxious, arrogant, loudmouth bother
Be seated at the right hand of the father
Washington hires Hamilton right on sight
But Hamilton still wants to fight, not write
Now Hamilton's skill with a quill is undeniable
But what do we have in common? We're
Reliable with the

[ALL MEN]
Ladies!

[BURR]
There are so many to deflower!

[ALL MEN]
Ladies!

[BURR]
Looks! Proximity to power

[ALL MEN]
Ladies!

[BURR]
They delighted and distracted him
Martha Washington named her feral tomcat after him!

[HAMILTON]
That's true

[FULL COMPANY]
1780

[BURR]
A winter's ball
And the Schuyler sisters are the envy of all
Yo, if you can marry a sister, you're rich, son

[HAMILTON]
Is it a question of if, Burr, or which one?

Helpless

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[HAMILTON/BURR/LAURENS/ALL WOMEN (EXCEPT ELIZA)]
Hey hey hey hey

Ohh, I do I do I do I
Dooo! Hey!
Ohh, I do I do I do I
Dooo! Boy you got me [ALL WOMEN]
Hey hey hey hey
Hey hey hey hey
Hey hey hey hey
Hey hey hey

[ELIZA AND WOMEN]
Helpless!
Look into your eyes, and the sky's the limit I'm helpless!
Down for the count, and I'm drownin' in ‘em

[ELIZA]
I have never been the type to try and grab the spotlight
We were at a revel with some rebels on a hot night
Laughin' at my sister as she's dazzling the room
Then you walked in and my heart went "Boom!"
Tryin' to catch your eye from the side of the ballroom
Everybody's dancin' and the band's top volume

[ELIZA AND WOMEN]
Grind to the rhythm as we wine and dine
[ELIZA]
Grab my sister, and
Whisper, "Yo, this
One's mine."

My sister made her way across the room to you
And I got nervous, thinking "What's she gonna do?"
She grabbed you by the arm, I'm thinkin' "I'm through"
Then you look back at me and suddenly I'm
Helpless!

Oh, look at those eyes

Oh!
Yeah, I'm
Helpless, I know

I'm so into you
I am so into you

I know I'm down for the count
And I'm drownin' in ‘em.

[ALL WOMEN]
Oooh

Oooh

Oooh

Oooh

Helpless!

Look into your eyes
And the sky's the limit
I'm
Helpless!
Down for the count
And I'm drownin' in ‘em

I'm helpless!

Look into your eyes
And the sky's the limit I'm helpless!

Down for the count
And I'm drownin' in ‘em.

[HAMILTON]
Where are you taking me?

[ANGELICA]
I'm about to change your life

[HAMILTON]
Then by all means, lead the way

[ELIZA]
Elizabeth Schuyler. It's a pleasure to meet you

[HAMILTON]
Schuyler?

[ANGELICA]
My sister

[ELIZA]
Thank you for all your service

[HAMILTON]
If it takes fighting a war for us to meet, it will have been worth it

[ANGELICA]
I'll leave you to it

[ELIZA AND WOMEN]
One week later

[ELIZA]
I'm writin' a letter nightly
Now my life gets better, every letter that you write me
Laughin' at my sister, cuz she wants to form a harem

[ANGELICA]
I'm just sayin', if you really loved me, you would share him
[ELIZA]
Ha!
Two weeks later
In the living room stressin'
My father's stone-faced
While you're asking for his blessin'
I'm dying inside, as
You wine
And dine
And I'm tryin' not to cry
‘cause there's nothing that your mind can't do
My father makes his way across the room
To you
I panic for a second, thinking
"we're through"
But then he shakes your hand and says
"Be true"
And you turn back to me, smiling, and I'm
Helpless!

Helpless!
Hoo!

That boy is mine
That boy is mine!

Helpless! Helpless!
Down for the count
And I'm drownin' in em

[ALL WOMEN]
Stressin'

Blessin'

Look into your eyes
And the sky's the
Limit I'm
Helpless!
Down for the count
And I'm drownin' in em

[HAMILTON]
Eliza, I don't have a dollar to my name
An acre of land, a troop to command, a dollop of fame
All I have's my honor, a tolerance for pain
A couple of college credits and my top-notch brain
Insane, your family brings out a different side of me
Peggy confides in me, Angelica tried to take a bite of me
No stress, my love for you is never in doubt
We'll get a little place in Harlem and we'll figure it out
I've been livin' without a family since I was a child
My father left, my mother died, I grew up buckwild
But I'll never forget my mother's face, that was real
And long as I'm alive, Eliza, swear to God
You'll never feel so...

[HAMILTON]
Eliza...

I've never felt so-

My life is gon' be fine cuz Eliza's in it.
[ELIZA]
I do I do I do I do!

I do I do I do I do!

Hey, yeah, yeah!

I'm down for the count
I'm-

I look into your eyes, and the sky's the limit
I'm

...drownin' in ‘em. [ALL WOMEN]
Helpless!

Helpless!

Helpless!

Down for the count
And I'm drownin' in ‘em

Satisfied

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[LAURE]

Alright, alright. That's what I'm talkin' about!
Now everyone give it up for the maid of honor
Angelica Schuyler!
[ANGELICA]
A toast to the groom!

To the bride!

From your sister

Who is always by your side

To your union

And the hope that you provide

May you always...

Be satisfied.

[ALL MEN]
To the groom!
To the groom!
To the groom!

To the bride!
To the bride!

Angelica!
Angelica!
Angelica!

By your side!

To the union!
To the revolution!

You provide!
You provide!

[HAMILTON AND MEN]
Always-

Rewind-

[ALL WOMEN]
To the groom!

To the bride!

To the bride!

[ELIZA AND WOMEN]
Angelica!

By your side!

To the union!
To the revolution!

You provide!

Always-

Rewind-

[ANGELICA]
I remember that night, I just might
Regret that night for the rest of my days

I remember those soldier boys
Tripping over themselves to win our praise

I remember that dreamlike candlelight
Like a dream that you can't quite place

But Alexander, I'll never forget the first
Time I saw your face

I have never been the same
Intelligent eyes in a hunger-pang frame
And when you said "Hi," I forgot my dang name
Set my heart aflame, ev'ry part aflame

[FULL COMPANY]
This is not a game...

[HAMILTON]
You strike me as a woman who has never been satisfied

[ANGELICA]
I'm sure I don't know what you mean. You forget yourself

[HAMILTON]
You're like me. I'm never satisfied

[ANGELICA]
Is that right?

[HAMILTON]
I have never been satisfied

[ANGELICA]
My name is Angelica Schuyler

[HAMILTON]
Alexander Hamilton

[ANGELICA]
Where's your fam'ly from?

[HAMILTON]
Unimportant. There's a million things I haven't done but
Just you wait, just you wait...

[ANGELICA]
So so so-
So this is what it feels like to match wits
With someone at your level! What the hell is the catch? It's
The feeling of freedom, of seein' the light
It's Ben Franklin with a key and a kite! You see it, right?
The conversation lasted two minutes, maybe three minutes
Ev'rything we said in total agreement, it's
A dream and it's a bit of a dance
A bit of a posture, it's a bit of a stance. He's a
Bit of a flirt, but I'm ‘a give it a chance
I asked about his fam'ly, did you see his answer?
His hands started fidgeting, he looked askance?
He's penniless, he's flying by the seat of his pants

Handsome, boy, does he know it!
Peach fuzz, and he can't even grow it!
I wanna take him far away from this place
Then I turn and see my sister's face and she is...

[ELIZA]
Helpless...

[ANGELICA]
And I know she is...

[ELIZA]
Helpless...

[ANGELICA]
And her eyes are just...

[ELIZA]
Helpless...

[ANGELICA]
And I realize

[ANGELICA AND COMPANY]
Three fundamental truths at the exact same time...

[HAMILTON]
Where are you taking me?

[ANGELICA]
I'm about to change your life

[HAMILTON]
Then by all means, lead the way

[COMPANY (EXCEPT ANGELICA)]
Number one!

[ANGELICA]
I'm a girl in a world in which
My only job is to marry rich
My father has no sons so I'm the one
Who has to social climb for one
So I'm the oldest and the wittiest and the gossip in
New York City is insidious
Alexander is penniless
Ha! That doesn't mean I want him any less

[ELIZA]
Elizabeth Schuyler. It's a pleasure to meet you

[HAMILTON]
Schuyler?

[ANGELICA]
My sister

[COMPANY]
Number two!

[ANGELICA]
He's after me cuz I'm a Schuyler sister
That elevates his status, I'd
Have to be naïve to set that aside
Maybe that is why I introduce him to Eliza
Now that's his bride
Nice going, Angelica, he was right
You will never be satisfied

[ELIZA]
Thank you for all your service

[HAMILTON]
If it takes fighting a war for us to meet, it will have been worth it

[ANGELICA]
I'll leave you to it

[COMPANY]
Number three!

[ANGELICA]
I know my sister like I know my own mind
You will never find anyone as trusting or as kind
If I tell her that I love him she'd be silently resigned
He'd be mine
She would say, "I'm fine"

[ANGELICA AND COMPANY]
She'd be lying

[ANGELICA]
But when I fantasize at night
It's Alexander's eyes
As I romanticize what might
Have been if I hadn't sized him
Up so quickly
At least my dear Eliza's his wife;
At least I keep his eyes in my life...
[ANGELICA]
To the groom!

To the bride!

From your sister

Who is always by your side

To your union

And the hope that you provide

May you always

Be satisfied

And I know

She'll be happy as

His bride
And I know [ALL MEN (EXCEPT HAMILTON)]
To the groom!
To the groom!
To the groom!

To the bride!
To the bride!

Angelica!
Angelica!

By your side

To the union!
To the revolution!

You provide!
You provide!

[HAMILTON AND MEN]
Always-

Be satisfied

Be satisfied

[MEN]
Be satisfied
Be satisfied
Be satisfied
Be satisfied

Be satisfied
Be satisfied

Be satisfied
Be satisfied
Be satisfied
Be satisfied.

[ALL WOMEN (EXCEPT ELIZA)]
To the groom!

To the bride!

To the bride!

[ELIZA AND WOMEN]
Angelica!

By your side

To the union!
To the revolution!

You provide!

Always-

Be satisfied

[WOMEN]
Be satisfied

Be satisfied

Be satisfied.

[ANGELICA]
He will never be satisfied
I will never be satisfied

The Story of Tonight (Reprise)

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[LAURE]

I may not live to see our glory!

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE]
I may not live to see our glory!

[LAURE]

But I've seen wonders great and small

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE]
I've seen wonders great and small

[LAURE]

‘Cause if the tomcat can get married

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE]
If Alexander can get married-

[LAURE]

There's hope for our ass, after all!

[LAFAYETTE]
Raise a glass to freedom

[LAURENS/MULLIGAN]
Hey!
Something you will never see again!

[MULLIGAN]
No matter what she tells you

[LAFAYETTE]
Let's have another round tonight!

[LAURE]

Raise a glass to the four of us!

[LAFAYETTE/HAMILTON]
Ho!

[MULLIGAN]
To the newly not poor of us!

[LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/HAMILTON]
Woo!

[LAFAYETTE]
We'll tell the story of tonight

[LAURE]

Let's have another round-

[HAMILTON]
Well, if it isn't Aaron Burr

[BURR]
Sir!

[HAMILTON]
I didn't think that you would make it

[BURR]
To be sure

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE]
Burr!

[BURR]
I came to say congratulations

[MULLIGAN]
Spit a verse, Burr!

[BURR]
I see the whole gang is here

[LAFAYETTE]
You are the worst, Burr!

[HAMILTON]
Ignore them. Congrats to you, Lieutenant Colonel
I wish I had your command instead of manning George's journal

[BURR]
No, you don't

[HAMILTON]
Yes, I do

[BURR]
Now, be sensible
From what I hear, you've made yourself indispensable

[LAURE]

Well, well, I heard
You've got a special someone on the side, Burr

[HAMILTON]
Is that so?

[LAURE]

What are you tryin' to hide, Burr?

[BURR]
I should go

[HAMILTON]
No, these guys should go

[LAFAYETTE]
What?

[LAURE]

No!

[HAMILTON]
Leave us alone

[MULLIGAN]
Man...

[HAMILTON]
It's alright, Burr. I wish you'd brought this girl with you tonight, Burr

[BURR]
You're very kind, but I'm afraid it's unlawful, sir

[HAMILTON]
What do you mean?

[BURR]
She's married

[HAMILTON]
I see

[BURR]
She's married to a British officer

[HAMILTON]
Oh shit...

[BURR]
Congrats again, Alexander. Smile more
I'll see you on the other side of the war

[HAMILTON]
I will never understand you
If you love this woman, go get her! What are you waiting for?

[BURR]
I'll see you on the other side of the war

[HAMILTON]
I'll see you on the other side of the war

Wait For It

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[BURR]
Theodosia writes me a letter everyday
I'm keeping the bed warm while her husband is away
He's on the British side in Georgia
He's trying to keep the colonies in line
But he can keep all of Georgia
Theodosia, she's mine

Love doesn't discriminate
Between the sinners
And the saints
It takes and it takes and it takes
And we keep loving anyway
We laugh and we cry
And we break
And we make our mistakes
And if there's a reason I'm by her side
When so many have tried
Then I'm willing to wait for it
I'm willing to wait for it
[BURR]
My grandfather was a fire and brimstone preacher

But there are things that the
Homilies and hymns won't teach ya

My mother was a genius

My father commanded respect

When they died they left no instructions
Just a legacy to protect

[MEN]
Preacher, preacher
Preacher

Teach ya, teach ya, teach ya

Respect, respect

[WOMEN]
Genius


[LAURE]

GOOD NEWS, SHE'S DEAD!
THE WITCH OF THE WEST IS DEAD!
THE WICKEDEST WITCH THERE EVER WAS,
THE ENEMY OF ALL OF US HERE IN [,
IS DEAD! GOOD NEWS! GOOD NEWS!

[LAURE]

Look, it's Glinda!


[LAURE]

floats in on a giant bubble

[LAURE]

 It's good to see me, isn't it? ([Ozians Agree) No need to respond that was rhetorical. Fellow [Ozia]


[BURR]
LET US BE GLAD,
LET US BE GRATEFUL,
LET US REJOICIFY THAT GOODNESS COULD SUBDUE
THE WICKED WORKINGS OF YOU KNOW WHO!
ISN'T IT NICE TO KNOW
THAT GOOD WILL CONQUER EVIL?
THE TRUTH WE ALL BELIEVE'LL BY AND BY
OUTLIVE A LIE
FOR YOU AND...

[BURR]
Glinda! Exactly how dead is she?

[[Burr] Well, there has been much rumor and speculation... innuendo, outuendo...
but let me set the record straight. According to the Time Dragon Clock, the melting occurred at the 13th hour;
a direct result of a bucket of water thrown by a female child. Yes, the Wicked Witch of the West is dead!

[Ozian]
NO ONE MOURNS THE WICKED!

[Ozian]
NO ONE CRIES THEY WON'T RETURN!

[Ozia]

NO ONE LAYS A LILY ON THEIR GRAVE!
[Ozian Man]
THE GOOD MAN SCORNS THE WICKED!
Women]
THROUGH THEIR LIVES OUR CHILDREN LEARN!

[Ozia]

WHAT WE MISS WHEN WE MISBEHAVE!
[Burr]
AND GOODNESS KNOWS
THE WICKEDS' LIVES ARE LONELY
GOODNESS KNOWS
THE WICKED DIE ALONE
IT JUST SHOWS WHEN YOU'RE WICKED
YOU'RE LEFT ONLY
ON YOUR OWN
[Ozia]

YES, GOODNESS KNOWS
THE WICKEDS' LIVES ARE LONELY
GOODNESS KNOWS
THE WICKED CRY ALONE
NOTHING GROWS FOR THE WICKED
THEY REAP ONLY
WHAT THEY'VE SEWN
[Ozian] Glinda, why does wickedness happen?
[Burr] That's a good question; one that many people find confusifying. Are people born wicked,
or do they have wickedness thrust upon them? After all, she had a childhood,;
She had a father, who just happed to be the governor of munchlinkland Witch's Parents Enter.

[Frex]
 I'm off to the assembly, dear.
[Burr] She had a mother, as so many do...
[Frex]

HOW I HATE TO GO AND LEAVE YOU LONELY
Melena]
THAT'S ALRIGH IT'S ONLY JUST ONE NIGHT
[Frex]

BUT KNOW THAT YOU'RE HERE, IN MY HEART
WHILE I'M OUT OF YOUR SIGHT!
Frex Exits. A Lover Runs Into The Room.
[Burr] And like all families, they had their secrets.
Lover]
HAVE ANOTHER DRINK, MY DARK EYED BEAUTY,
I'VE GOT ONE MORE NIGHT LEFT HERE IN TOWN,
SO HAVE ANOTHER DRINK OF GREEN ELIXER
AND WE'LL HAVE OURSELVES A LITTLE MIXER
HAVE ANOTHER LITTLE SWALLOW LITTLE LADY,
AND FOLLOW ME DOWN
[Burr] And of course, from the moment she was born she was... well... different!
Midwife] AHHH!! It's coming!
[Frex]
 Now?
Midwife] The baby's coming!
[Frex]
 And how!

Midwife]
I SEE A NOSE!
[Frex]

I SEE A CURL!
Both]
IT'S A HEALTHY, PERFECT, LOVELY LITTLE...

Melena] What is it? What's wrong?
Midwife]
HOW CAN IT BE?
[Frex]

WHAT DOES IT MEAN?
Midwife]
IT'S ATTROCIOUS!
[Frex]

IT'S OBSCENE!
Both]
LIKE A FROGGY, FERNY CABBAGE,
THE BABY IS UNATURALLY
GREEN!!!
[Frex]
 Take it away... Take it away!!!!
[Burr] So you see, it couldn't have been easy!

Munchki]

NO ONE MOURNS THE WICKED!
NOW AT LAST, SHE'S DEAD AND GONE!
NOW AT LAST THERE'S JOY THROUGHOUT THE LAND!
AND GOODNESS KNOWS (GOODNESS KNOWS)
WE KNOW WHAT GOODNESS IS (OOOOHHHH)
GOODNESS KNOWS, THE WICKED DIE ALONE (SHE DIED ALONE)
WOE TO THOSE (WOE TO THOSE)
WHO SPURN WHAT GOODNESSES THEY ARE SHOWN!
NO ONE MOURNS THE WICKED (GOOD NEWS)
NO ONE MOURNS THE WICKED (GOOD NEWS)
NO ONE MOURNS... THE WICKED...
WICKED...
WICKED!!!!!
[Burr] Well, this has been fun! But as you can imagine I have much to attend to,
what with the Wizard's unexpected departure. So, if there are no further questions...
[Ozian] Glinda, is it true you were her friend?
[Ozians Gasp
[Burr] Well, I... you see... um... yes.
Louder Gasps
[Burr] Well, it depends on what you mean by "friend". She Motions Her Bubble Downward.
I did know her. That is, our paths did cross... at school. But you must understand, it was a long time ago and we were both very young.

[HAMILTON] Oh, this is my younger sister, Nessarose. As you can see, she is a perfectly normal color.

 Welcome, new students! I am Madame Morrible, headmistress here, at Shiz University.
And whether you're here to study logic, literature, or linguification,
I know I speak for my fellow faculty members when I say we have nothing but the highest hopes for some of you.
Now, regarding room assignments... Elphaba & Galinda Raise Their Hands.
She Notices Galinda First. Yes, is this regarding room assignments?
[linda]

 Oh, Madame, thank you for asking, but I've already been assigned a private suite...
Noticing Her Followers' Disappointment. But you can all come visit me whenever you want!
Shen Shen] How good of you!
Pfanee] You are so good!
[linda]

 No I'm not!
Both] Yes you are!
[linda]

 Now stop! Swishes Her Hair.
[Morrible]
 Do you have a question?

[linda]

 Yes, you see, I am Galinda Upland of the Upperuplands... I've applied to your sorcery seminar,
and indeed that is my sole purpose of attending Shiz; to study sorcery with you.
Perhaps you recall my essay, "Magic Wands, Need They Have A Point".
[Morrible]
 Yes... However, I do not teach my seminar every semester, unless, of course, somebody special were to come along.
[linda]

 Well, exactly!
[HAMILTON] We have not yet received our room assignments.
[Morrible]
 Yes, yes, of course! Oh, You must be Miss Nessarose, the governor's daughter.
What a tragically beautiful face you have! Sees Elphaba, snorts...And you must be.
[HAMILTON] I'm the other daughter. Elphaba. I'm beautifully tragic.
[Morrible]
 Yes, yes, I'm sure you're very bright.
[linda]

 Bright? She's phosphorescent.
[Morrible]
 I don't seem to have you on my list. Oh, well a slight gulch, but not to fret! We'll find someplace to put you.
[linda]

 Y'know, I don't even think she read my essay.
Shen Shen] That's so unfair!
[Angelica]
 You should say something!
[linda]

 Should I?
Pfanee] Do it!
[Morrible]
 Now, which one of you young ladies would like to volunteer to share with Miss Elphaba?
[linda]

 Madame Morrible...
[Morrible]
 Thank you dear. Oh, how very good of you!
[linda]

 What?
[Morrible]
 Miss Elphaba, you may share with Miss Galinda.
[linda]

 Huh?
[Morrible]
 The governor made his concern for your sister's well being quite clear.
So, I thought it would be best if she share my private compartment where I can assist her as needed...
[HAMILTON] But Madame, I've always looked after my sister.
[Morrible]
 Everyone, to your dormitories.
[HAMILTON] But Madame...
[HAMILTON] Let her go!!!
Nessarose's Wheelchair Is Torn From Morrible's Hands And Begins To Wheel Itself Back To Elphaba.
[Morrible]
 How did you do that?
[linda]

 How did she do that?
[Angelica]
 Elphaba!
[Morrible]
 You mean this has happened before?
[HAMILTON] Uh... Something just comes over me sometimes... I'm sorry, Madame.
[Morrible]
 What? Never apologize for talent! Talent is a gift! Have you ever considered a career in sorcery?
[HAMILTON] Sorcery?
[Morrible]
 I shall tutor you myself, and take no other students.
[linda]

 What?
All Students But Galinda Exit.
[Morrible]
 Oh, Miss Elphaba...
MANY YEARS I HAVE WAITED
FOR A GIFT LIKE YOURS TO APPEAR
WHY I PREDICT THE WIZARD COULD MAKE YOU HIS
MAGIC, GRAND VIZIER!
MY DEAR, MY DEAR,
I'LL WRITE AT ONCE TO THE WIZARD
TELL HIM OF YOU IN ADVANCE
WITH A TALENT LIKE YOURS, DEAR, THERE IS
A DEFIN-ISH CHANCE
IF YOU WORK AS YOU SHOULD
YOU'LL BE MAKING GOOD
[linda]

 Madame Morrible...
[Morrible]
 No, not now dearest. She Exits.
[Burr] This will just make me a better person. She simles.
She Runs Off.

[HAMILTON]
DID THAT REALLY JUST HAPPEN?
HAVE I ACTUALLY UNDERSTOOD?
THIS WEIRD QUIRK I'VE TRIED TO SURPRESS OR HIDE
IS A TALENT THAT COULD HELP ME MEET THE WIZARD
IF I MAKE GOOD
SO I'LL MAKE GOOD.
WHEN I MEET THE WIZARD,
ONCE I PROVE MY WORTH,
AND THEN I MEET THE WIZARD,
WHAT I'VE WAITED FOR SINCE
SINCE BIRTH!
AND WITH ALL HIS WIZARD WISDOM
BY MY LOOKS HE WON'T BE BLINDED
DO YOU THINK THE WIZARD IS DUMB?
OR LIKE MUNCHKINS SO SMALL-MINDED? NO!
HE'LL SAY TO ME "I SEE WHO YOU TRULY ARE,
A GIRL ON WHOM I CAN RELY"
AND THAT'S HOW WE'LL BEGIN,
THE WIZARD AND I
ONCE I'M WITH THE WIZARD,
MY WHOLE LIFE WILL CHANGE,
'CUZ ONCE YOU'RE WITH THE WIZARD
NO ONE THINKS YOU'RE STRANGE
NO FATHER IS NOT PROUD OF YOU,
NO SISTER ACTS ASHAMED,
AND ALL OF OzHAS TO LOVE YOU
WHEN BY THE WIZARD YOU'RE ACLAIMED
AND THIS GIFT OR THIS CURSE
THAT I HAVE INSIDE
MAYBE AT LAST I'LL KNOW WHY
WHEN WE ARE HAND IN HAND,
THE WIZARD AND I
AND ONE DAY HE'LL SAY TO ME, "ELPHABA,
A GIRL WHO IS SO SUPERIOR,
SHOULDN'T A GIRL WHO'S SO GOOD INSIDE
HAVE A MATCHING EXTERIOR?
AND SINCE FOLKS HERE TO AN OBSURED DEGREE
SEEM FIXATED ON YOUR VERDEGRIS
WOULD IT BE ALRIGHT BY YOU
IF I DEGREENIFY YOU?"
AND OF COURSE THAT'S NOT IMPORTANT TO ME
"ALRIGHT! WHY NOT?" I'LL REPLY
OH, WHAT A PAIR WE'LL BE
THE WIZARD AND I
YES, WHAT A PAIR WE'LL BE
THE WIZARD AND...
UNLIMITED, MY FUTURE IS UNLIMITED
AND I'VE JUST HAD A VISION ALMOST LIKE A PROPHECY
I KNOW
IT SOUNDS TRULY CRAZY
AND TRUE, THE VISION'S HAZY
BUT I SWEAR SOME DAY THERE'LL BE
A CELEBRATION THROUGHOUT [Oz
THAT'S ALL TO DO
WITH ME!
AND I'LL STAND THERE WITH THE WIZARD
FEELING THINGS I'VE NEVER FELT
AND THOUGH I'D NEVER SHOW IT
I'D BE SO HAPPY I COULD MELT!
AND SO IT WILL BE FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE
AND I'LL WANT NOTHING ELSE 'TILL I DIE
HELD IN SUCH HIGH ESTEEM!
WHEN PEOPLE SEE ME THEY WILL SCREAM
FOR HALF OF [Oz'S FAVORITE TEAM]
THE WIZARD...
AND I!!!!

[linda]

 Dearest, Darlingest Momsy and Popsicle...
[HAMILTON] My dear father...
Both]
THERE'S BEEN SOME CONFUSION OVER ROOMING HERE AT SHIZ
[HAMILTON]

BUT, OF COURSE, I'LL RISE ABOVE IT...
Both]
FOR I KNOW THAT'S HOW YOU'D WANT ME TO RESPOND
Yes...
THERE'S BEEN SOME CONFUSION FOR YOU SEE MY ROOMATE IS...
[linda]


UNUSUALLY, AND EXCEEDLINGLY PECULIAR AND ALTOGETHER QUITE IMPOSSIBLE TO DESCRIBE...
[HAMILTON] Blonde.

[linda]


MY PULSE IS RUSHING...

MY HEAD IS REELING...

THOUGH, I DO ADMIT IT CAME ON FAST,
STILL I DO BELIEVE THAT IT CAN LAST!
AND I WILL BE LOATHING, LOATHING YOU
MY WHOLE LIFE LONG!
[Students]

DEAR GALINDA, YOU ARE JUST TOO GOOD!
HOW DO YOU STAND IT, I DON'T THINK I COULD!
SHE'S A TERROR! SHE'S A TARTAR!
WE DON'T MEAN TO SHOW A BIAS,
BUT GALINDA, YOU'RE A MARTAR!
[linda]

 Well...
THESE THINGS ARE SENT TO TRY US!
[Students]

POOR GALINDA FORCED TO RESIDE
WITH SOMEONE SO DISGUSTICIFIED
WE JUST WANT TO TELL YOU
WE'RE ALL ON YOUR SIDE!
[Students]

[HAMILTON] Boo!
[linda]

 Ahh!
[HAMILTON] Hahahaha!

[Hamilton]
 Settle down, now! I have read your most recent essays. And I am amazed to report the progress!
Although, some of us still tend to favor form over content... Ms. Glinda.
[linda]

 It's GAlinda.
[Hamilton]
 Excuse me... Glinda.
[linda]

 I really don't see what the problem is. Every other professor seems to be able to pronounce my name.
[HAMILTON] Maybe pronouncing your precious name isn't the sole purpose of Doctor Dillamond's life. Maybe he's not like every other professor. Maybe some of us are different.
[linda]

 Oh! It seems the artichoke is steamed.
[Hamilton]
 Class, class! Miss Elphaba has a point! As you know, I am the sole Animal on the faculty. The token Goat, as it were. But it wasn't always this way. Oh, dear students, how I wish you could have seen it as it once was. Where you could walk down the halls and see an antelope explicating a sonnet, a snow leopard solving an equation, a wildebeast waxing philosophic. Don't you see, dear students, how our dear Ozis becoming less and less...looks at Elphaba... colorful. Now, who can tell me what sent these events into motion?
[HAMILTON] Raises hand From what I've heard, it all started with the great drought.
[Hamilton]
 Exactly. Food grew scarce, people grew hungrier and angrier. And the question became "Whom can we blame?" Can anyone tell me what is meant by the term "Scapegoat"? Elphaba Raises Hand. Someone besides Miss Elphaba? Ah yes, Miss Glinda...
[linda]

 It's GAlinda... with a GA. I don't see why you can't just teach us history instead of always harping on the past.
[Hamilton]
 Well, perhaps these questions will enlighten you... Walks Over To The Chalk Board And Turns It Over. On it is written] ANIMALS SHOULD BE SEEN AND NOT HEARD. Who is responsible for this? I'm waiting for answer... Very well, that will be all for today... You heard me, class dismissed!!!
All Students Exit Except Elphaba & Nessarose. Dillamond Has His Back Turned To Her.
[HAMILTON] You go on ahead, Nessa.
Nessarose Exits.
[HAMILTON] Reading The Board Aloud. "Animals should be seen and not heard..."
[Hamilton]
 Oh, Miss Elphaba, don't worry about me, go along and enjoy your friends.
[HAMILTON] Oh that's alright, I have no friends. Would you like to share my lunch?
[Hamilton]
 Oh, thank you! How kind.
She Pulls Out A Candy Bar And Unwraps It. He Takes The Paper and Begins To Eat It. He Sees The Board.
[Hamilton]
 I seem to have lost my appetite.
[HAMILTON] You shouldn't let statements like that bother you. I mean, I always do, but you shouldn't.
[Hamilton]
if it were only a matter of words on a chalkboard. But the things one hears these days... dreadful things! Miss Elphaba...

I'VE HEARD OF AN OX, A PROFESSOR FROM QUOX
NO LONG PERMITTED TO TEACH,
WHO HAS LOST ALL POWERS OF SPEECH.
AND AN OWL IN MUNCHKIN ROCK
A VICAR WITH A THRIVING FLOCK
FORBIDDEN TO PREACH
NOW HE ONLY CAN SCREECH!
ONLY RUMORS, BUT STILL, ENOUGH TO GIVE PAUSE
TO ANYONE WITH PAWS
SOMETHING BAD IS HAPPENING IN [Oz
[HAMILTON]
SOMETHING BAD?
HAPPENING IN [Oz?
[Hamilton]

UNDER THE SURFACE
BEHIND THE SCENES
SOMETHING BAAAAAH...
Sorry, bad...
[HAMILTON] Dr. Dillamond, are you alright? Shall I fetch you a glass of water?
[Hamilton]
 No, I don't know what came over me.
[HAMILTON] So, you're saying that there are animals that have, somehow, forgotten how to speak? But, how is that possible?
[Hamilton]
 Well, with so much pressure not to...
Morrible Enters.
[Morrible]
 I heard there was some sort of disturburance in class. Are you alright, Doctor? Oh, Miss Elphaba, you're still here! I thought you would have been on your way to my seminar by now.
[HAMILTON] Yes Madame, ordinarily I would be but...
[Morrible]
 But what? I do hope I have not misplaced my trust in you. Magic is a very demanderating mistress, and if one has ambitions of meeting the Wizard. I'm sure Doctor Dillamond sees my point.
Morrible Exits.
[HAMILTON] I'd better go. Doctor Dillamond, if something bad is happening to the Animals then someone has to tell the Wizard. That's why we have a Wizard!
SO NOTHING BAD
Both]
NOTHNG ALL THAT BAD
[Hamilton]

NOTHING TRULY BAAAAHHH...
Sorry... Bad.
[HAMILTON]
IT COULDN'T HAPPEN HERE,
IN [Oz...


[BURR]
 Here we are, sir! Shiz University!
[BURR]
 What? Already?
[BURR]
 Yes, sir.
[BURR]
 What a shame. Well, we'll see you soon, Avaric. Don't worry, I won't last longer at this school than I did at any of the others.
Avaric Exits.
[Angelica]
 Uh, miss Galinda, I know I'm just a munchkin, but munchkins have feelings too, and I've been trying to tell you mine, for you. But sometimes it seems like you don't even know I'm there.
[linda]

 That's not true, Biq.
[Angelica]
 It's LAFAYETE.
[linda]

 Biq, do you know who that is? That's Fiyero Tiggular, tha Winkie Prince whose reputation is so scandalacious!
LAFAYETE Looks Disgusted. Fiyero Walks Toward Them. Galinda Swishes Her Hair. Fiyero, Noticing Her Strange Behavior, Does The Same.
[linda]

 To Fiyero. Were you looking for something or someone?
[BURR]
 Uhhh yea... history... class? I don't know... somewhere?
[Angelica]
 History building is way over there my friend...
[linda]

 That class just ended!
[BURR]
 Oh! Perfect timing! So, uh, what does one do for fun around here?
[linda]

 Nothing really... until now...
[Angelica]
 We've been studying!
[BURR]
 Well, I see that once again the responsibility to corrupt my fellow students falls to me. Fortunately, I'm up for the task.


[BURR]

THE TROUBLE WITH SCHOOLS IS
THEY ALWAYS TRY TO TEACH THE WRONG LESSON
BELIEVE ME, I'VE BEEN KICKED OUT OF ENOUGH OF THEM TO KNOW!
THEY WANT YOU TO BECOME LESS CALLOW, LESS SHALLOW,
BUT I SAY WHY INVITE STRESS IN?
STOP STUDYING STRIFE
AND LEARN TO LIVE
THE UNEXAMINED LIFE...
DANCIN' THROUGH LIFE
SKIMMING THE SURFACE
GLIDING WHERE TURF IS SMOOTH
LIFE IS PAINLESS FOR THE BRAINLESS
THOSE WHO DON'T TRY, NEVER LOOK FOOLISH
DANCING THROUGH LIFE
NO NEED TO TOUGH IT
WHEN YOU CAN SLUFF IT OFF AS I DO
NOTHING MATTERS, BUT KNOWING NOTHING MATTERS
IT'S JUST LIFE, SO KEEP DANCING THROUGH
DANCING THROUGH LIFE
SWAYING AND SWEEPING
AND ALWAYS KEEPING COOL
LIFE IS FRAUGHTLESS
WHEN YOU'RE THOUGHTLESS
THOSE WHO DON'T TRY
NEVER LOOK FOOLISH
DANCING THROUGH LIFE
MINDLESS AND CARELESS
MAKE SURE YOU'RE WHERE LESS TROUBLE IS RIFE
WHOES ARE FLEETING
BLOWS ARE GLANCING
WHEN YOU'RE DANCING
THROUGH LIFE!
So! What's the most swankified place in town?
[linda]

 That would be the

Sounds perfect!
LET'S GO DOWN TO THE [OzDUST BALLROOM
WE'LL MEET THERE LATER TONIGHT
WE CAN DANCE 'TIL IT'S LIGHT
FIND THE PRETTIEST GIRL
GIVE HER A WHIRL!
RIGHT ON DOWN TO THE [OzDUST BALLROOM
COME ON FOLLOW ME!
YOU'LL BE HAPPY TO BE THERE
[Students]

DANCIN' THROUGH LIFE, DOWN AT THE [OzDUST (LIFE!)
[BURR]

IF ONLY BECAUSE DUST IS WHAT WE COME TO!
[Students]

NOTHIN' MATTERS, BUT KNOWING NOTHING MATTERS
IT'S JUST LIFE!!!
[BURR]

SO KEEP DANCING THROUGH...
[Angelica]
 Miss Galinda? I hope you'll save at least one dance for me. I'll be waiting right there, right by your side, waiting, all night.
[linda]

 Oh, how very kind, Biq.
[Angelica]
 ... LAFAYETE...
[linda]

 But, do you know what would be even kinder?
SEE THAT TRAGICALLY BEAUTIFUL GIRL?
THE ONE IN THE CHAIR?
IT SEEMS SO UNFAIR
WE SHOULD GO ON A SPREE
AND NOT SHE, GEE
I KNOW SOMEONE WOULD BE MY HERO
IF THAT SOMEONE WERE
TO GO INVITE HER!
[Angelica]
 Well, maybe I could invite her!
[linda]


OH, BIQ, REALLY?
YOU WOULD DO THAT FOR ME?
[Angelica]
 I would do anything for you, Miss Galinda. Walks Over To Nessarose.
Excuse me, Miss Nessarose? There's something I'd like to ask you...
[BURR]
 To Galinda. You're good.
[linda]

 I don't know what you mean. But I do happen to be free tonight, so...
[BURR]
 So, I'll be picking you up around eight?
[linda]

 After all...
NOW THAT WE'VE MET ONE ANOTHER,
Both]
IT'S CLEAR WE DESERVE EACHOTHER!
[linda]

 You're perfect!
[BURR]
 You're perfect!
[CAST]
SO WE'RE PERFECT TOGETHER
BORN TO BE FOREVER
DANCING THROUGH LIFE!!!
[HAMILTON] It's absurd! This silly, rich boy appears and everyone's off to worship him and some cultish social gathering!
[Angelica]
 Even me! I'm going! Isn't it wonderful? LAFAYETE was too shy to ask me at first, but once Galinda encouraged him...
[HAMILTON] Galinda?!
[Angelica]
 Don't you dare say another word against her! I'm about to have the first happy night of my life all thanks to Galinda!
FINALLY FOR THIS ONE NIGHT,
I'M ABOUT TO HAVE A FUN NIGHT
WITH THIS MUNCHKIN BOY GALINDA FOUND FOR ME
AND I ONLY WISH THERE WERE
SOMETHING I COULD DO FOR HER TO REPAY HER
ELPHABA SEE...
WE DESERVE EACHOTHER AND GALINDA HELPED IT COME TRUE
WE DESERVE EACHOTHER, ME AND LAFAYETE
Please, Elphaba, try to understand.
[HAMILTON] I do...
[linda]

 Now I must accessorize myself for Fiyero.
Shen Shen Pulls The Witch's Hat Out Of One Of Galinda's Hat Boxes.
Pfanee] Galinda, what in [Oz's name!?
[linda]

 Now, just pretend you didn't see that. My granny is always giving me the most hideodeous hats.
I'd give it away, but I don't hate anyone that much.
Shen Shen] Yes you do!
Pfanee] Give it to her! Just do it!
They All Stare At Elphaba. Galinda Walks Forward, Meeting Elphaba Half Way.
[HAMILTON] Galinda, listen, Nessa and I were talking about you just now...
[linda]

 And I was just talking about you! I thought you might want to wear this hat to the party tonight! Gives Her The Hat.
IT'S REALLY... UH... SHARP!
DON'T YOU THINK?
Y'KNOW BLACK, IS THIS YEAR'S PINK!
YOU DESERVE EACHOTHER,
THIS HAT AND YOU,
YOU'RE BOTH SO... SMART!
YOU DESERVE EACHOTHER, SO HERE!
OUT OF THE GOODNESS OF MY HEART!
Galinda Runs Off. Elphaba Laughs At The Sight Of The Hat. She Exits.. The Students Enter And Dance.
When This Is Done, LAFAYETE And Nessarose Appear, Awkwardly Holding Hands.
[Angelica]
 What's in the punch?
[Angelica]
 Lemons, and melons, and pears!
[Angelica]
 Oh my!
[Angelica]

LISTEN NESSA...
[Angelica]
 Yes?
[Angelica]

UH, NESSA...
I'VE GOT SOMETHING TO CONFESS A
REASON WHY, WELL, WHY I ASKED YOU HERE TONIGHT...
NOW, I KNOW IT ISN'T FAIR.
[Angelica]
 Oh, LAFAYETE, I know why.
[Angelica]
 You do?
[Angelica]

IT'S BECAUSE I'M IN THIS CHAIR, AND YOU FELT SORRY FOR ME...
WELL, ISN'T THAT RIGHT?
[Angelica]
 No... it's because... uh... because...
BECAUSE YOU ARE SO BEAUTIFUL!
[Angelica]
 Oh, LAFAYETE!
I THINK YOU'RE WONDERFUL!
AND WE DESERVE EACH OTHER, DON'T YOU SEE THIS IS OUR CHANCE?
WE DESERVE EACH OTHER, DON'T WE LAFAYETE?
[Angelica]
 You know what? Let's dance!
[Angelica]
 What?
[Angelica]

LET'S DANCE!
They Dance, As Well As The Others Around Them. Finally, Mme. Morrible Runs Up To Galinda.
[Morrible]
 Oh, Miss Upland?
[linda]

 Madame Morrible... What are you doing here?
[Morrible]
 I have something for you. She Hands Her A Small Wand.
[linda]

 Gasps. Madame... a training wand... How can I ever express my graditution?
[Morrible]
 Oh, don't thank me! This was your roommate's idea, not mine.
[linda]

 What? Elphaba?
[Morrible]
 Miss Elphaba requested that I include you in sorcery class. She insisted I tell you this very night or she would quit the seminar.
[linda]

 But... why?
[Morrible]
 I have no idea. My personal opinion is you do not have what it takes. I hope you'll prove me wrong... I doubt you will.
She Leaves. Fiyero Comes Up To Galinda.
[BURR]
 What is it?
[linda]

 I got what I wanted...
[BURR]
 Then what's the matter?
[linda]

 Nothing...
[BURR]
 Good. Let's dance...
They Begin To Dance As Elphaba Walks In. They Stop As All The Students Gasp And Make Comments About The Way She Is Dressed. People Then Start Laughing.
[BURR]
 Who in Ozis this?
[linda]

 My roommate... please, don't ... stare!
[BURR]
 How can you help it?
Elphaba Takes Off The Hat, Noticing The Comments. She Waits, Then Puts It Back On And Begins To Dance. She Is Alone. There Is No Music.
[BURR]
 Well I'll say this, she doesn't give a twig about what anyone else thinks.
[linda]

 Of course does, she just pretends not to... I feel awful...
[BURR]
 Why? It's not like it's your fault.
[linda]

 Excuse me... She Walks Over To Elphaba and Clears Her Throat. May I cut in?
Galinda Begins Dancing Just As Horribly. The Students Now Accept It, And Begin To Dance Again As The Music Starts.
All]
DANCING THROUGH LIFE, DOWN AT THE [OzDUST
IF ONLY BECAUSE DUST IS WHAT WE COME TO
AND THE STRANGE THING, YOUR LIFE COULD END UP CHANGING
WHILE YOU'RE DANCING THROUGH

[Scene 9 - Sharing Secrets]
Elphaba & Galinda Barge Into Their Suite... Galinda Is In Hysterics.
[linda]

 Your very first party ever?! Your very first party! Oh I know! Let's tell each other something we've never told anyone... I'll go first] Fiyero and I are going to be married (squeals).
[HAMILTON] Really? He's asked you already?
[linda]

 No, he doesn't know yet... Now, you tell me a secret.
[HAMILTON] Like what?
[linda]

 Like... Why do you always sleep with this funny, little, green bottle under your pillow? Grabs The Bottle.
[HAMILTON] Give that back.
[linda]

 C'mon, tell me. Tell me tell me!
[HAMILTON] It was my mother's! That's all...
Silence.
[linda]

 Hands Her The Bottle. It's not fair. I told you a really good one.
[HAMILTON] My father hates me.
[linda]

 Gasps.
[HAMILTON] No, that's not the secret. It's my fault...
[linda]

 What is?
[HAMILTON] ... that my sister is the way she is. . Pause. You see, when my mother was carrying Nessa, my father was worried that the new baby might come out...
Both] Green.
[HAMILTON] So he made my mother chew milk flowers, day and night. But that made Nessa come too soon, with her little legs all tangled. And my mother never woke up. None of which ever would have happened if not for me.
[linda]

 But that was the milkflowers fault, not yours. That may be your secret, Elphaba, but that doesn't make it true. She Oh look, it's tomorrow! Elphie... do you mind if I call you Elphie?
[HAMILTON] Well, it's a little perky.
[linda]

 And you can call me... Galinda. So... Elphie... now that we're friends, I've decided to make you my new project!
[HAMILTON] You really don't have to do that.
[linda]

 I know, that's what makes me so nice!

[linda]


WHENEVER I SEE SOMEONE LESS FORTUNATE THAN I

WHEN I SEE DEPRESSING CREATURES
WITH UNPREPOSSESSING FEATURES,
I REMIND THEM ON THEIR OWN BEHALF
TO THINK OF
CELEBRATED HEADS OF STATE
OR ESPECIALLY GREAT COMMUNICATORS
DID THEY HAVE BRAINS OR KNOWLEDGE?
DON'T MAKE ME LAUGH!
THEY WERE POPULAR
PLEASE, IT'S ALL ABOUT POPULAR
IT'S NOT ABOUT APTITUDE
IT'S THE WAY YOU'RE VIEWED
SO IT'S VERY SHREWD TO BE
VERY VERY POPULAR
LIKE ME!
[HAMILTON] This is never going to work!
[linda]

 Oh Elphie, you mustn't think that way anymore! Your whole life is going to change... and all because of me. Okay, stand... I will turn your frock into a beautiful ball gown! Stand up... She Picks Up Her Wand And Waves It. Ball gown!!! Nothing Happens, So She Repeats. Ball gown!!! Still Nothing Happens. She Taps Her Wand On The Bed. Is this thing on?
[HAMILTON] Do you want me to try?
[linda]

 No, I've got it! She Throws The Wand Down. Oh, just wear the frock... it's pretty! Now,
I'll show you how to flip your hair] Flip flip. Or you could use your hand. Demonstrates.
Or, you can use your whole body. Falls onto bed. Squeals. Now, for the finishing touch.
Takes flower out of her hair, puts it into Elphaba's. Why, Miss Elphaba, look at you, you're beautiful. Hands her the mirror.
[HAMILTON] After Looking In The Mirror. I... I have to go.
She Runs Off.
[linda]

 You're Welcome! She Admires Herself In The Mirror.
AND THOUGH YOU PROTEST
YOUR DISINTEREST,
I KNOW CLANDESTINELY...
YOU'RE GONNA GRIN AND BEAR IT
YOUR NEW FOUND POPULARITY! (SQUEALS)
LA LA LA LA
YOU'LL BE POPULAR!
JUST NOT QUITE AS POPULAR
AS ME!!!

[HAMILTON] Flips her hair.. Flip Flip! What?
[BURR]
 Nothing, it's just... you've been "Galinda-fied". You don't have to do that , you know?
[Hamilton]
 Alright, take your seats, class! I have something to say, and very little time to say it. This is my last day here at Shiz I am no longer permitted to teach. I want to thank you for your sharing your enthusiasm, your essays, no matter how feebly structured, and even, on occasion, your lunch.
Mme. Morrible Rushes In.
[Morrible]
 Doctor Dillamond! I'm so dreadfully sorry.
[HAMILTON] Madame, we've got to do something.
[Hamilton]
 Miss Elphaba, they can take away my job, but I shall continue speaking out.
Scientist] Come on, goat...
To Men Begin To Carry Him Out Of The Room.
[Hamilton]
 They are not telling you the whole story! Remember that, class! Remember that.
He Is Gone.
[HAMILTON] Doctor Dillamond! After A Pause. Well, are you just going to sit here in silence?
[Morrible]
 Miss Elphaba, there is nothing we can do. Please take your seat.
Professor] Good afternoon, students!
[Morrible]
 Good afternoon.
Professor] Every day, with every tick of the Time Dragon Clock, in every corner of our great [Oz, one hears the silence of progress. For example] this is called a cage!
He Points To A Cage With A Cloth Draped Over It. He Pulls Off The Cloth, Revealing A Lion Cub Inside.
Professor] Now, we will be seeing more and more of them in the near future. This remarkable innovation is actually for the Animal's own good...
[HAMILTON] If this is for his own good, then why is he trembling?
Professor] He's just excited to be here, that's all. Hits the cage. Now, as I was saying, one of the benefits of caging a Lion cub while he's young is that he never, in fact, will learn how to speak.
[HAMILTON] What?
He Motions The Students Forward, Toward The Cage.
Professor] That's right! Come closer!
[HAMILTON] To Fiyero. Can you imagine a world where Animals are kept in cages and they never speak?
Professor] Now, he may seem a bit agitated but that's easily remedied.
[HAMILTON] What should I do?
[BURR]
 I don't know.
[HAMILTON] Well, somebody has to... Do something!!!
Sparks Begin To Fly Everywhere. All Students & The Professor Are Moving Uncontrollably Except Fiyero and Elphaba.
[BURR]
 What's happening?
[HAMILTON] I don't know I got mad...andd
[BURR]
 Alright just don't move! And don't get mad at me... He Grabs The Cage. Well are you coming?
She Runs With Him After He Snatches The Lion Cub.
[HAMILTON] Careful! Don't shake him!
[BURR]
 I'm not!
[HAMILTON] We can't just let him loose anywhere, you know. We have to find someplace safe...
[BURR]
 Don't you think that I realize that? You must think I'm really stupid or something!
[HAMILTON] No, not really stupid.
[BURR]
 Why is it that every time I see you you're causing some sort of commotion?
[HAMILTON] I don't cause commotions, I am one.
[BURR]
 That's for sure.
[HAMILTON] Oh! So you think I should just keep my mouth shut! Is that what you're saying?
[BURR]
 No, I'm...
[HAMILTON] Do you think I want to be this way? Do you think I want to care this much? Don't you know how much easier my life would be if I didn't?
[BURR]
 Do you ever let anyone else talk?
[HAMILTON] Oh, sorry... But can I just say one more thing? You could have just walked away back there.
[BURR]
 So?
[HAMILTON] So, no matter how shallow and self-absorbed you tend to be...
[BURR]
 Excuse me, there's no pretense here. I happen to be genuinely self-absorbed and deeply shallow.
[HAMILTON] No you're not. Or you wouldn't be so unhappy.
[BURR]
 Fine, if you don't want my help...
[HAMILTON] No, I do! Poor little thing, it's heart is trembling... I didn't mean for...
[BURR]
 What did you mean to do? Why was I the only one you didn't do it to?
[HAMILTON] Oh look, you're bleeding... it must have scratched you. Referring To A Cut On His Face.
[BURR]
 Yea... or maybe it scratched me. I better get to safety... I mean the cub... get the cub to safety. He Walks Off.
[HAMILTON] Fiyero...

THERE'S A GIRL I KNOW
HE LOVES HER SO
I'M NOT THAT GIRL...

[[HAMILTON]
Miss Elphaba, there you are!
[HAMILTON] Madame Morrible...
[Morrible]
 Oh Miss Elphaba, I finally heard back from the Wizard!
[HAMILTON] The Wizard?
[Morrible]
 Yes, he wishes to meet you!
[HAMILTON] He asked for me?
[Morrible]
 Yes! I know how devastated you were the other day for our poor Doctor Dillamond, but I can assure you my dear, as one door closes, another one opens. She Hands Her A Green Envelope.
[HAMILTON] Madame, I don't know what to say! How can I ever thank you? She Hugs Her.
[Morrible]
 Oh careful dear, you musn't get wet She Places The Umbrella Back Over Elphaba's Head. Oh, I know! She Waves Her Hands And The Sun Comes Out. Didn't I tell you? Weather is my specialty. [Oz-speed, my dear! Make me proud.
[HAMILTON] I will, I'll try.
Morrible Exits.

[HAMILTON]
AND THERE WE'LL FINALLY BE
THE WIZARD AND I...

Conductor] All aboard!
[linda]

 Remember, eye contact. And don't forget to tell him how wonderful he is, Wizards love that! And be yourself... well... within reason.
LAFAYETE Wheels Nessarose Onstage.
[Angelica]
 Elphaba, I'm so proud of you and I know father would be too. We're all proud, aren't we?
[HAMILTON] You'll be alright, won't you?
[linda]

 She'll be fine! Biq will take care of her, right?
[Angelica]
 ...It's LAFAYETE... I... I can't do this anymore.
He Exits.
[Angelica]
 LAFAYETE...
[linda]

 Nessa, maybe he's just not the right one... for you.
[Angelica]
 No, it's me that's not right. Elphaba, just go, I'll be fine.
She Wheels Herself Offstage.
[HAMILTON] Nessa, wait!
[linda]

 Let her go. She'll have to manage without you. We all will.
[HAMILTON] Please, you'll barely even notice I'm gone. Besides, you have Fiyero. Where is he, anyway? Not that I expected him to say goodbye to me. We barely know each other.
[linda]

 I don't know him either. He's distant, and moodified, and he's been thinking, which really worrries me. I never knew how much he card about that old goat.
Fiyero Enters.
[linda]

 Oh, there he is! Fiyero, over here dearest!
[BURR]
 He Hands Elphaba Flowers. Elphaba, I'm happy for you.
[linda]

 Yes, we are both so happy...
[BURR]
 Uh, listen, I've been thinking...
[HAMILTON] Yes, I've heard.
[BURR]
 About that Lion cub and... everything. I think about that day a lot.
[HAMILTON] Really? So do I.
[linda]

 Me too! Poor Doctor Dillamond. It makes one want to... uh...
take a stand. So I've been thinking of... uh... changing my name.
[BURR]
 Your name?
[linda]

 Well, yes! Since Doctor Dillamond had his own way of pronouncing my name,
in solidarity and to express my outrage, I will henceforward be known no longer as Galinda, but as simply, Glinda.
[BURR]
 Oh well, that's very admirable of you... Glinda. To Elphaba. Elphaba, good luck.
He Runs Off.
[Burr] There, see?
[HAMILTON] Galinda...
[Burr] It's Glinda now. Stupid idea, I don't even know what made me say it.
[HAMILTON] It doesn't matter what your name is, everyone loves you!
[Burr] I don't care! I want him. I don't even think he's perfect anymore and I still want him.
This must be what other people feel like. How do they bear it? They embrace.

[HAMILTON] Come with me.
[Burr] Where?
[HAMILTON] To the Emerald City.
[Burr] Really?
[Ozia]

ONE SHORT DAY, IN THE EMERALD CITY...

[HAMILTON] I want to remember this moment, always. Nobody's pointing, nobody's staring, for the first time, I'm somewhere that I belong.

A Large Head Is Rolled Onstage... It Speaks To The Two... Voice Booming
[Hamilton]
I am [Oz, the great and terrible! Who are you and why do you seek me?
[Burr] Say something!
[HAMILTON] Uh... Elphaba Thropp your terribleness!
His Speaks Normally.
[Hamilton]
Oh? Is that you Elphaba? I didn't realize!
He Climbs Out Of The Head.
[Hamilton]
I hope I didn't startle you, it's so hard to make out peoples' faces all the way back there.
So, let's see... which is which? Elphaba! He grabs her hands. And you must be.
[Burr] Glinda. The Ga is silent.
Elphaba touches the Ozmask.
[Hamilton]
I know. It isn't much, is it? But people expect this sort of thing. You have to give people what they want.
The thing is, I hardly ever let people meet the real me, but this being special occasion.
[HAMILTON] I'm so happy to meet you.
[Hamilton]
Well, that's good. 'Cause that's what I love best] making people happy!
I AM A SENTIMENTAL MAN
WHO ALWAYS LONGED TO BE A FATHER
THAT'S WHY I DO THE BEST I CAN
TO TREAT EACH CITIZEN OF OzAS SON
OR DAUGHTER
SO ELPHABA I'D LIKE TO RAISE YOU HIGH
'CUZ I THINK EVERYONE DESERVES THE CHANCE TO FLY!
AND HELPING YOU WITH YOUR ASCENT
ALLOWS ME TO FEEL SO PARENTAL.
FOR I AM
A SENTIMENTAL MAN!
[HAMILTON] I'm here... we're here to alert you that something bad is happening...
[Hamilton]
Please, I'm the Wizard of [Oz. I already know why you've come.
Elphaba & [Burr] Oooo.
[Hamilton]
Of course, you must prove yourself...
[Burr] Prove yourself, prove yourself.
[HAMILTON] But how?
[Hamilton]
Oh, I don't know.
SOME SORT OF GESTURE
MOSTLY FOR SHOW
SOMETHING TO TEST YOUR ADEPTNESS..
I know! Madame, the book!
Morrible Enters.
[Burr] Madame Morrible...
[Hamilton]
I believe you're well acquainted with my new Press Secretary.
[HAMILTON] Press Secretary?
[Morrible]
 Oh, yes dearies, I've risen up in the world. You'll find that the Wizard is a very generous man.
If you do something for him, he'll do much for you.
[HAMILTON] What do yhou want me to do?
[Hamilton]
Well, this is my monkey servent, Chistery. He looks so longingly at the birds every morning....
[Morrible]
 So the Wizard was thinking, perhaps, a levitation spell...
[Burr] Noticing A Book In Morrible's Hands. Is that the Grimmerie?
[Morrible]
 Yes, the ancient book of spells and enchantments. Hands It To Elphaba.
[Burr] Whispers. Can I touch it?
Morrlbe] Whispers. No!
[HAMILTON] What funny writing...
[Morrible]
 Well it's a lost language. The lost language of spells.
[Hamilton]
It's kind of a recipe book for change.
[Morrible]
 Don't be discouraged if you can't decipherate it, dearie.
I, myself, can only read a spell or two, and that took years and years
[HAMILTON]
AHVEN, TATEY, AVEN TATEY AVEN...
[Hamilton]
She Continues Chanting. Oh, Chistery, what a experience you are about to have!
[HAMILTON] .................................. AH MAY AH TAY ATUM
[Hamilton]
SINCE ONCE I HAVE MY OWN DAY IN THE SKY...
[HAMILTON] AH MAY AH TAH TAY MAY TU SE SAY TA!
[Hamilton]
I KNOW EVERYONE DESERVES THE CHANCE TO FLY!
Chistery Screams & Begins To Twitch.
[HAMILTON] What happened? Is something wrong?
[Morrible]
 No just a transition, dearie.
[HAMILTON] No, stop you're hurting him!
[Hamilton]
She's actually done it!
Chistery Sprouts Wings. And Begins Running Around The Stage.
[HAMILTON] NO! Quick, how do I reverse it?
[Morrible]
 You can't!
[HAMILTON] What?!
[Morrible]
 You can't! Spells are irreversible! I knew she had the power, I told you!
[HAMILTON] You planned all this?
[Morrible]
 Well, you benefit too, dearie! You benefit, too.
[Hamilton]
And this is only the beginning! Look.
The Other Monkeys Begin To Grow Wings And Fly.
[Morrible]
 Won't they make perfect spies?
[HAMILTON] Spies?!
[Hamilton]
You're right, that's a harsh word... how about scouts? That's what they'll be really. They'll fly around [Oz! Report any subversive Animal activity.
[HAMILTON] You can't read this book at all! Can you? That's why you need enemies, and cages, and spies. You have no real power.
[Hamilton]
Exactly... that's why I need you. Don't you see? The world is your oyster, now! You have so many...opportunites. You both do.
[Burr] Thank you, your [Ozness.
Wizard]
SINCE ONCE I HAD MY OWN DAY IN THE SKY
I KNOW EVERYONE DESERVES THE CHANCE TO...
[HAMILTON] NO!
She Runs Off.
[Morrible]
 Elphaba!
[Burr] Elphie! I am so sorry, your Wizardship. I'll fetch her back! Elphie wait!
She Runs After Her.
[Hamilton]
We must get her back. She knows too much.
[Morrible]
 Don't worry! I will handle it.
He Gets Back In The Head. Speaking, Again, With A Powerful Voice.
[Hamilton]
Guards, guards! There is a fugitive loose in the palace! Find her, capture her, and bring her to me!
Guards] Yes your [Ozness!

[Burr] Elphie, wait! Where are you going?
[HAMILTON] Oh no! There are no more stairs! This might be the attic...
[Burr] Elphaba, listen to me...
[HAMILTON] I have to barricade the door! She Picks Up A Broom And Places It Over A Trap Door.
[Burr] Elphaba, why couldn't you have stayed calm for once instead of flying off the handle?
I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY
I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY NOW
I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY HOW YOU'VE HURT YOUR CAUSE FOREVER
I HOPE YOU THINK YOU'RE CLEVER
[HAMILTON]
I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY! I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY TOO
I HOPE YOU'RE PROUD HOW YOU WOULD GROVEL IN SUBMISSION
TO FEED YOUR OWN AMBISSION
Both]
SO THOUGH I CAN'T IMAGINE HOW
I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY
RIGHT NOW...
[Morrible]
 Citizens of [Oz, there is an enemy that must be found and captured! Believe nothing she says. She's evil. Responsible for the mutilation of these poor, innocent monkeys! Her green skin is but an outward manifestation of her twisted nature! This distortion... this repulsion... this... Wicked Witch!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[Burr] Don't be afraid...
[HAMILTON] I'm not... it's the Wizard who should be afraid... of me!
[Burr] Elphie, just say you're sorry before it's too late.
YOU CAN STILL BE WITH THE WIZARD
WHAT YOU'VE WORKED AND WAITED FOR
YOU CAN HAVE ALL YOU EVER WANTED...
[HAMILTON] I know...
BUT I DON'T WANT IT
NO, I CAN'T WANT IT
ANYMORE...
SOMETHING HAS CHANGED WITHIN ME
SOMETHING IS NOT THE SAME
I'M THROUGH WITH PLAYING BY THE RULES
OF SOMEONE ELSE'S GAME!
TOO LATE FOR SECOND GUESSING
TOO LATE TO GO BACK TO SLEEP
IT'S TIME TO TRUST MY INSTINCTS
CLOSE MY EYES...
AND LEAP
IT'S TIME TO TRY DEFYING GRAVITY
I THINK I'LL TRY DEFYING GRAVITY
AND YOU CAN'T PULL ME DOWN
[Burr]
CAN'T I MAKE YOU UNDERSTAND
YOU'RE HAVING DELUSIONS OF GRANDURE?
[HAMILTON]
I'M THROUHG EXCEPTING LIMITS
'CUZ SOMEONE SAYS THEY'RE SO
SOME THINGS I CANNOT CHANGE,
BUT 'TIL I TRY I'LL NEVER KNOW!
TOO LONG I'VE BEEN AFRAID OF
LOSING LOVE I GUESS I'D LOST
WELL IF THAT'S LOVE,
IT COMES AT MUCH TOO HIGH A COST!
I'D SOONER BUY DEFYING GRAVITY
KISS ME GOODBYE I'M DEFYING GRAVITY
AND YOU CAN'T PULL ME DOWN!
The Guards Bang On The Locked Door.
[Guard]
 Open this door, in the name of his supreme [Ozness!
[HAMILTON] Ah May Ah Tay Ah Tum Ditum...
[Burr]
That's what started all this in the first place... that hideous levitation spell! STOP!!!
[Burr] Well... Where are your wings? Maybe you're not as powerful as you think you are...
A Broomstick Floats Across The Room Towards Elphaba.
[HAMILTON] I told you, Glinda... I did it, I tell ya!
The Guards Bang On The Door Once Again.
[HAMILTON] Quick! Get on!
[Burr] What?
[HAMILTON] Come with me... think of what we could do... together.
UNLIMITED, TOGETHER WE'RE UNLIMITED
TOGETHER WE'LL BE THE GREATEST TEAM THERE'S EVER BEEN, GLINDA
DREAMS THE WAY WE PLANNED 'EM
[Burr]
IF WE WORK IN TANDEM
Both]
JUST YOU AND I DEFYING GRAVITY
WITH YOU AND I DEFYING GRAVITY
[HAMILTON]
THEY'LL NEVER BRING US DOWN.
Well, are you coming?
[Burr] Elphie, you're trembling... here, put this around you...
She Drapes A Black Cape Around Her.
I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY
NOW THAT YOU'RE CHOOSING THIS
[HAMILTON] You too.
I HOPE IT BRINGS YOU BLISS
Both]
I REALLY HOPE YOU GET IT
AND YOU DON'T LIVE TO REGRET IT
I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY IN THE END!
I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY...
MY FRIEND...
Elphaba Runs Off. The Guards Break Down The Door.
[Guard]
 There she is! Don't let her get away!
They Grab Hold Of Glinda.
[Burr]
What in [Oz?! Let go of me! Do you hear me? Let go!
[HAMILTON]
It's not her. She has nothing to do with. I'm the one you want. It's me. Hahahahaha. It's me! Up here! It's me!
She Rises Up Center Stage Holding Her Broom.
[HAMILTON]
SO IF YOU CARE TO FIND ME,
LOOK TO THE WESTERN SKY
AS SOMEONE TOLD ME LATELY,
EVERYONE DESERVES THE CHANCE TO FLY!
AND IF I'M FLYING SOLO,
AT LEAST I'M FLYING FREE!
TO THOSE WHO GROUND ME,
TAKE A MESSAGE BACK FROM ME!
TELL THEM HOW I AM DEFYING GRAVITY!!!
I'M FLYING HIGH DEFYING GRAVITY!!!
AND SOON I'LL MATCH THEM IN RENOWN

All]
WE COULDN'T BE HAPPIER
THANK GOODNESS!
[Morrible]
 And thank goodness for you, Glinda, and your handsome swain, our new captain of the guard.
To Fiyero. Now you've been at the forefront of the hunt for the Wicked Witch, haven't you?
[BURR]
 Not really, but I don't like to think of her as a Wicked Witch.
[Morrible]
 Captain, how does it feel?
[BURR]
 Frustrating... but I became captain of the guard to find her, and I will keep searching!
[Morrible]
 No, being engaged!
[Ozia]
 Congratulotions!
[BURR]
 To Glinda - Confused. This is an engagement party?
[Burr] Surprised?
[BURR]
 Yes!
[Burr] Good, we hoped you'd be... the Wizard and I!
WE COULDN'T BE HAPPIER
RIGHT DEAR?
COULDN'T BE HAPPIER
RIGHT HERE
LOOK WHAT WE'VE GOT
A FAIRY TALE PLOT
OUR VERY OWN HAPPY ENDING
WHERE WE COULDN'T BE HAPPIER
TRUE DEAR?
COULDN'T BE HAPPIER
AND WE'RE HAPPY TO SHARE OUR ENDING VICARIOUSLY
WITH ALL OF YOU!
HE COULDN'T LOOK HANDSOMER
I COULDN'T BE HUMBLER
BECAUSE HAPPY IS WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN ALL YOUR DREAMS COME TRUE...
[Morrible]
 And Glinda, dear, we're happy for you! As Press Secretary,
I have striven to ensure that all of Ozknows the story of your braverism! How I vividly remember...
THE DAY YOU WERE FIRST SUMMONED
TO AN AUDIENCE WITH [Oz,
AND ALTHOUGH HE WOULD NOT TELL YOU WHY INITIALLY
WHEN YOU BOWED BEFORE HIS THROWN
HE DECREED YOU'D HENCE BE KNOWN
AS GLINDA THE GOOD
OFFICIALLY!
[BURR]
 That's not how you described it to me.
[Burr] Oh no, not exactly, but Whispers we'll talk about it later.
[Morrible]

THEN WITH A JEALOUS SQUEEE
THE WICKED WITCH BURST FROM CONCEALMENT
WHERE SHE HAD BEEN LURKING
SURREPTITIALLY!
Gasps From Among The Crowd.
[Ozian]
I HEAR SHE HAS AN EXTRA EYE THAT ALWAYS REMAINS AWAKE!
[Ozian]
I HEAR THAT SHE CAN SHED HER SKIN AS EASILY AS A SNAKE!
[Ozian]
I HEAR SOME REBEL ANIMALS ARE GIVING HER FOOD AND SHELTER!
[Ozian]
I HEAR HER SOUL IS SO UNCLEAN, PURE WATER CAN MELT HER!
[BURR]
 What?
[Ozia]

MELT HER! PLEASE SOMEBODY GO AND MELT HER!
[BURR]
 Do you hear that?! Water will melt her? People are so empty-headed they'll believe anything!
[Burr] Excuse me just a tick-tock!
Her And Fiyero Talk Aside.
[BURR]
 I can't just stand here grinning pretending to go along with all of this!
[Burr] Do you think I like to hear them say those awful things about her? I hate it!
[BURR]
 Then what are we doing here? Let's go, let's get out of here!
[Burr] We can't leave now, not when people are looking to us to raise their spirits.
[BURR]
 You can't leave, because you can't resist this. And that is the truth.
[Burr] Maybe I can't. Is that so wrong? Who could?
[BURR]
 You know who could. Who has.
[Burr] Fiyero, I miss her too, but we can't just stop living. No one has searched harder for her than you. But don't you see? She doesn't want to be found. We have to face it.
[BURR]
 You're right. I'm sorry, you're right. And if it's going tol make you happy, of course I'll marry you.
[Burr] But it'll make you happy too, right?
[BURR]
 You know me... I'm always happy. He Runs Off.
[Burr] Fiyero! Thanks plenty dearest! He's gone to fetch me a refreshment, he's so thoughtful that way!
THAT'S WHY I COULDN'T BE HAPPIER
NO, I COULDN'T BE HAPPIER
THOUGH IT IS I ADMIT, THE TINIEST BIT
UNLIKE I ANTICIPATED,
BUT I COULDN'T BE HAPPIER
SIMPLY COULDN'T BE HAPPIER...
Well, not simply...
'CUZ GETTING YOUR DREAMS, IT'S STRANGE BUT IT SEEMS
A LITTLE, WELL, COMPLICATED...
THERE'S A KIND OF A SORT OF COST
THERE'S A COUPLE OF THINGS GET LOST...
THERE ARE BRIDGES YOU CROSSED YOU DIDN'T KNOW YOU CROSSED UNTIL YOU'VE CROSSED!
AND IF THAT JOY THAT THRILL
DOESN'T THRILL LIKE YOU THINK IT WILL...
STILL... WITH THIS PERFECT FINALE
THE CHEERS AND THE BALLYHOO
WHO WOULDN'T BE HAPPIER?
SO I COULDN'T BE HAPPIER
BECAUSE HAPPY IS WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN ALL YOUR DREAMS COME TRUE...
WELL, ISN'T IT?
HAPPY IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOUR DREAMS COME...
TRUE!!!!
[Ozia]

WE LOVE YOU GLINDA IF WE MAY BE SO FRANK!
[Burr]
THANK GOODNESS!
[Ozia]

FOR ALL THIS JOY WE KNOW WHO WE'VE GOT TO THANK!
THANK GOODNESS!
THAT MEANS THE WIZARD, GLINDA...
[Burr]
AND FIANCE!
[Ozia]

THEY COULDN'T BE GOODLIER
SHE COULDN'T BE LOVLIER
WE COULDN'T BE LUCKIER!
[Burr] I COULDN'T BE HAPPIER!!!
[Ozia]
 THANK GOODNESS!!!

Elphaba's Voice Is Heard Inside A Closet.
[HAMILTON] Well, it seems the beautiful only get more beautiful, Nessarose Screams while the green just get greener.
Nessarose Is Scared And Confused.
Elphaba Steps Out Of The Closet.
[HAMILTON] I'm sorry. Did I scare you? I seem to have that effect on people. It's good to see you.
[Angelica]
 What are you doing here?
[HAMILTON] Well, there's no place like home. I never thought I'd hear myself say this but I need father's help. I need him to stand with me.
[Angelica]
 That's impossible.
[HAMILTON] No, no it's not. Not if you ask him. You know he'll listen to you.
[Angelica]
 Father's dead.
[HAMILTON] What?
[Angelica]
 He's dead. I'm the governor... Well what did you expect? After he learned what you'd done,
how you'd disgraced u,s he died... of shame. Embarrassed to death.
[HAMILTON] Good, I'm glad. It's better that way.
[Angelica]
 That's a wicked thing to say.
[HAMILTON] No, it's true. Because now it's just us. You can help me and together we can...
[Angelica]
 Elphaba, shut up! First of all, I can't harbor a fugitive, I'm an un-elected official!
And why should I help you? You fly around [Oz, trying to rescue animals you've never even met,
and not once have you ever thought to use your powers to rescue me!
ALL OF MY LIFE, I'VE DEPENDED ON YOU
HOW DO YOU THINK THAT FEELS?
ALL OF MY LIFE I'VE DEPENDED ON YOU
AND THIS HIDEOUS CHAIR WITH WHEELS!
SCROUNGING FOR SCRAPS OF PITY TO PICK UP
AND LONGING TO KICK UP
MY HEELS...
[HAMILTON] Nessa, there isn't a spell for everything! The power is mysterious.
It's not like coddling up a pair of... She Pulls Out The Grimmerie From Her Bag. Wait.
[Angelica]
 What are you doing?
Elphaba Begins Chanting.
[Angelica]
 What is that? Ah! My shoes! It feels like... like they're on fire! What have you done to my shoes???
She Lifts Her Dress, Revealing The Ruby Slippers. Nessarose Stands, But Falls. Elphaba Gives Her A Hand.
[Angelica]
 No, don't help me. She Stands.
[HAMILTON] Oh, Nessa, at last...
I'VE DONE WHAT LONG AGO I SHOULD
AND FINALLY FROM THESE POWERS SOMETHING GOOD
FINALLY SOMETHING GOOD...
[Angelica]
 LAFAYETE! LAFAYETE! Come quickly!
[HAMILTON] LAFAYETE?
[Angelica]
 LAFAYETE! Come here at once!
[HAMILTON] No! Nessa, listen, nobody can know I'm here!
Nessarose Runs Behind The Closet As LAFAYETE Enters.
[Angelica]
 Yes, what is it, Madame?
[HAMILTON] LAFAYETE...
[Angelica]
 What are you doing here? You stay back!
[HAMILTON] LAFAYETE, it's just me, I'm not going to hurt you!
[Angelica]
 No! You're lying! That's all you ever do! You and your sister! She's as wicked as you are!
[HAMILTON] What are you talking about?
[Angelica]
 I'm talking about my life. The little that's left of it. I'm not free to leave Munchkinland, none of us are.
Ever since she took power, she's been stripping the Munchkins of our rights...
and we didn't have that many to begin with! And do you know why?
Nessarose Reveals Herself In The Chair.
[Angelica]
 To keep you here, with me. But none of that matters anymore. Look.
Nessarose Stands Up.
[Angelica]
 To Elphaba. You did this for her?
[Angelica]
 For both of us!
[Angelica]
 Nessa, this changes everything.
[Angelica]
 I know.
[Angelica]

LISTEN NESSA...
[Angelica]
 What?
[Angelica]

UH NESSA, SURELY NOW I'LL MATTER LESS TO YOU
AND YOU WON'T MIND MY LEAVING HERE TONIGHT...
[Angelica]
 Leaving?
[Angelica]
 Yes...
THAT BALL THAT'S BEING STAGED
ANNOUNCING GLINDA IS ENGAGED
[Angelica]
 Glinda?
[Angelica]

YES NESSA THAT'S RIGHT!
I'VE GOT TO GO APPEAL TO HER
EXPRESS THE WAY I FEEL TO HER
Oh, Nessa, I lost my heart to Glinda from the moment I first saw her. You know that.
[Angelica]
 Lost your heart? Well, we'll see about that...
[HAMILTON] Nessa, let him go...
[Angelica]

DID YOU THINK I'D LET YOU LEAVE ME HERE FLAT?
[Angelica]
 Don't come any closer!
YOU'RE GOING TO LOSE YOUR HEART TO ME, I TELL YOU!
IF I HAVE TO... I HAVE TO...
Sees The Grimmerie.
MAGIC SPELL YOU...
She Grabs The Book.
[Angelica]
 Ah... Tum... Tah... Tae...
Elphaba Reveals Herself.
[HAMILTON] Nessa, stop!
[Angelica]
 What is she doing?!
[HAMILTON] No, Nessa, you're pronouncing the words all wrong!
[HAMILTON] Nessa!
[Angelica]
 LAFAYETE! What is it?
[Angelica]
 Gasps. My heart feels like it's... shrinking.
[Angelica]
 Elphaba, do something!
[HAMILTON] I can't! You can't reverse a spell once it's been cast!
[Angelica]
 So what do we do?
LAFAYETE Falls Into Nessa's Empty Wheel Chair. Elphaba Wheels Him Behind The Closet.
[Angelica]
 Elphaba, do something!
[Angelica]
 This is all your fault! If you hadn't shown me that horrendible book.
[HAMILTON] I have to find another spell... it's the only thing that might work. She Goes Behind The Closet As Well.
[Angelica]
 Save him, please!
JUST SAVE HIM, MY POOR LAFAYETE, MY SWEET MY BRAVE,
DON'T LEAVE ME 'TIL MY SORRY LIFE HAS CEASED...
Elphaba Wheels The Chair Out, Which Is Not Facing The Audience And Is Seen Casting A Spell.
ALL ALONE AND LOVELESS HERE
JUST THE GIRL IN THE MIRROR
JUST HER AND ME! THE WICKED WITCH OF THE EAST!
WE DESERVE EACH OTHER...
[Angelica]
 Well... what about his heart?
[HAMILTON] It's all right. He won't need one now. I have to go. I have business to attend to in the Emerald City.
Nessa, I have done everything I could for you but it has never been enough and it never will be...
She Leaves.
[Angelica]
 Elphaba, wait! Elphaba!
LAFAYETE Wakes Up.
[Angelica]
 Where am I? What happened?
[Angelica]
 Nothing, LAFAYETE, you just fell asleep... and...
He Sits Up, Squeaking. He Is Made Of Tin. Nessarose Screams.
[Angelica]
 What is it, what's wrong?
[Angelica]
 No, it wasn't me it was her! I tried to stop her.
LAFAYETE Screams Uncontrollably And Runs Off.
[Angelica]
 LAFAYETE, please listen! It was Elphaba! LAFAYETE! It was Elphaba!!!

[Hamilton]
[HAMILTON] Well you have, you have harmed me.
[Hamilton]
I realize that, and I regret it. Elphaba...
[HAMILTON] There you are! I'm setting those monkeys free! And don't try to interfere, or call the guards...
[Hamilton]
I'm not calling anyone. The truth is I'm glad to see you again. It gets pretty lonely around here. And I know you must get lonely too.
[HAMILTON] You don't know the first thing about me.
[Hamilton]
Oh, but I do. I do know you. I can't explain it exactly. You know what I mean? Elphaba, you've been so strong through all of this, aren't you tired of being the strong one? Wouldn't you like someone to take care of you? He Hands Her Back The Broom. Please, help me start again.
[HAMILTON] Don't you think I wish I could? That I could go back to the time when I believed you really were wonderful? The Wonderful Wizard of [Oz? Nobody believed in you more than I did.
[Hamilton]
Oh, my dear child...
I NEVER ASKED FOR THIS OR PLANNED IT IN ADVANCE
I WAS MERELY BLOWN HERE BY THE WINDS OF CHANCE
I NEVER SAW MYSELF AS A SOLOMON OR SOCRATES
I KNEW WHO I WAS, ONE OF YOUR DIME A D[OzEN MEDIOCRATES
THEN SUDDENLY I'M HERE, RESPECTED, WORSHIPED EVEN
JUST BECAUSE THE FOLKS IN OzNEEDED SOMEONE TO BELIEVE IN
DOES IT SURPRISE YOU I GOT HOOKED AND ALL TOO SOON
WHAT CAN I SAY? I GOT CARRIED AWAY
AND NOT JUST BY BALLOON...
WONDERFUL
THEY CALLED ME WONDERFUL
SO I SAID, WONDERFUL, IF YOU INSIST
I WILL BE WONDERFUL
AND THEY SAID WONDERFUL
BELIEVE ME IT'S HARD TO RESIST
'CUZ IT FEELS WONDERFUL
THEY THINK I'M WONDERFUL
HEY LOOK WHO'S WONDERFUL
THIS CORN-FED HICK!
WHO SAID IT MIGHT BE KEEN
TO BUILD A TOWN OF GREEN
AND A WONDERFUL ROAD OF YELLOW BRICK!
See, I never had a family of my own since I was always traveling, and I guess I just wanted to give the citizens of Ozeverything.
[HAMILTON] So you lied to them?
[Hamilton]
Only verbally. Besides, they were the lies they wanted to hear. Elphaba, where I come from we believe all sorts of things that aren't true... we call it history!
A MAN'S CALLED A TRAITOR
OR LIBERATOR
A RICH MAN'S A THIEF
OR PHILANTHROPIST
IS ONE A CRUSADER
OR RUTHLESS INVADER
IT'S ALL IN THE LABEL WHICH IS ABLE TO PERSIST
THERE ARE PRECIOUS FEW AT EASE
WITH MORAL AMBIGUITIES
SO WE ACT AS THOUGH THEY DON'T EXIST...
THEY CALL ME WONDERFUL
SO I AM
INFACT, IT'S SO MUCH WHO I AM IT'S PART OF MY NAME!
AND WITH MY HELP YOU CAN BE THE SAME...
AT LONG, LONG LAST RECEIVE YOUR DUE
LONG OVERDUE
ELPHABA, THE MOST CELEBRATED
ARE THE REHABILITATED
THERE'LL SUCH A WHOOPDEE DOO!
A CELEBRATION THROUGHOUT [Oz,
THAT'S ALL TO DO WITH YOU!
WONDERFUL, THEY'LL CALL YOU WONDERFUL!
[HAMILTON]
THAT DOES SOUND WONDERFUL!
Wizard]
TRUST ME IT'S FUN!!!
Both]
WHEN YOU ARE WONDERFUL,
IT WOULD BE WONDERFUL!
WONDERFUL, WONDERFUL
Wizard]
ONE, TWO AND...
They Dance.
[HAMILTON]
I'LL ACCEPT YOUR PROPOSITION
[Hamilton]
Wonderful
[HAMILTON]
ON ONE CONDITION
[Hamilton]
Yes?
[HAMILTON] You set those Monkeys free.
[Hamilton]
Done.

[HAMILTON] Go! Fly! You're Free! Fly! Chistery, Chistery, you're free, isn't it wonderful?! Go, fly! She Makes Her Way To Another "Monkey" Covered By A Sheet.
[Hamilton]
No! No! Please!
She Pulls Off The Cover, Revealing Dr. Dillamond.
[HAMILTON] No! It can't be! Doctor Dillamond...
[Hamilton]
Elphaba, we just couldn't keep letting him speak out...
[HAMILTON] Doctor Dillamond, are you alright? Don't be afraid. It's me, Elphaba.
[Hamilton]
 Bahhhhh.
[HAMILTON] Doctor, don't you remember me?
[Hamilton]
 Bahhhhh.
[HAMILTON] Can't you speak?
[Hamilton]
 Bahhhhh.
[HAMILTON] No... We have nothing in common. I am nothing like you and I never will be and I will fight you until the day I die!!!
The Wizard Climbs Into The Head And Dr. Dillamond Runs Offstage.

[Hamilton]
Guards, guards!!!
Fiyero Runs In With His Men.
[Guard]
 Halt!
[BURR]
 Are you alright, your [Ozness?
[HAMILTON] Fiyero!
[BURR]
 I don't believe it...
[HAMILTON] Oh , Fiyero, thank God. I thought you were...
[BURR]
 Silence witch!!!
[Guard]
 There's a Goat on the lam, sir.
[BURR]
 Never mind all that. Fetch me some... some water.
[Guard]
 Water, sir?
[BURR]
 You heard me, as much as you can carry.
Guards] Yes, sir!
They March Off.
[HAMILTON] Fiyero...
[BURR]
 I said silence!
[Hamilton]
He Runs Out Of The Head. No! No!
[BURR]
 Don't make a sound, your [Ozness, unless you want all your guests to know the truth about the Wonderful Wizard of [Oz... Elphaba, I'll find Doctor Dillamond later, no get out of here.
[HAMILTON] Fiyero, you frightened me. I thought, I though you might have changed.
[BURR]
 I have... changed.
Glinda Enters.
[Burr] What's going on... Elphie? Oh, thank Ozyou're alive! Only you shouldn't have come. If anyone discoverates you ...
[BURR]
 Glinda, you'd better go.
[Burr] Fiyero, what are you...
[BURR]
 Please, just go back to the ball.
[Burr] Your [Ozness, he means no disrespectation. Please understand! You see, we all went to school together...
[BURR]
 Elphaba!
[Burr] Fiyero, have you misplaced your mind? What are you doing?
[BURR]
 I'm going with her.
[Burr] What? What are you saying? You mean all this time... the two of you... behind my back...
[HAMILTON] No, Glinda it wasn't like that!
[BURR]
 Actually, it was...but it wasn't...Elphaba, let's go... let's go!
They Run Off.
[Burr] Fine, go! You deserve each other...
The Wizard Holds A Small Bottle With A Green Liquid.
[Hamilton]
Here, have a swig of this, it dulls the pain.
[Burr] No, thank you.
Mme. Morrible Enters, Laughing.
[Morrible]
 Oh, is it true? Your betrothed has taken her into custody?
[Hamilton]
Our new captain of the guard had other plans.
[Morrible]
 You mean she hasn't been captured?
[Hamilton]
Quite the contrary. And considering how well she eluded us last time...
[Morrible]
 Well, we'll just flush her out and force her to show herself.
[Hamilton]
But how?
[Burr] Her sister
[Morrible]
 What? What did she say?
[Burr] Use her sister. Spread a rumor. Make her think her sister is in trouble and she will fly to her side... and you'll have her.
[Hamilton]
Exactly so.
[Burr] Now, if your [Ozness will excuse me I have a slight headache, I think I'll lie down.
She Walks Out.
[Morrible]
 Yes, well...a rumor won't do it. Elphaba's too smart for that.
[Hamilton]
Far too smart.
[Morrible]
 Perhaps, a change in the weather...

[Burr]
DON'T WISH, DON'T START
WISHING ONLY WOUNDS THE HEART...
THERE'S A GIRL I KNOW, HE LOVES HER SO...
I'M NOT THAT GIRL...

Only Elphaba & Fiyero Are On Stage, In The Woods
[HAMILTON]
KISS ME TOO FIERCELY, HOLD ME TOO TIGHT
I NEED HELP BELIEVING YOU'RE WITH ME TONIGHT
MY WILDEST DREAMINGS COULD NOT FORSEE
LYING BESIDE YOU WITH YOU WANTING ME
IF JUST FOR THIS MOMENT
AS LONG AS YOU'RE MINE
I'VE LOST ALL RESISTANCE
AND CROSSED SOME BORDERLINE
AND IF IT TURNS OUT
IT'S OVER TOO FAST
I'LL MAKE EVERY LAST MOMENT LAST
AS LONG AS YOU'RE MINE...
[BURR]

MAYBE I'M BRAINLESS, MAYBE I'M WISE,
BUT YOU'VE GOT ME SEEING THROUGH DIFFERENT EYES,
SOMEHOW I'VE FALLEN UNDER YOUR SPELL
AND SOMEHOW I'M FEELING
IT'S UP THAT I FELL
Both]
EVERY MOMENT, AS LONG AS YOU'RE MINE
I'LL WAKE UP MY BODY
AND MAKE UP FOR LOST TIME
[BURR]

SAY THERE'S NO FUTURE
FOR US AS A PAIR...
Both]
AND THOUGH I MAY KNOW,
I DON'T CARE
IF JUST FOR THIS MOMENT
AS LONG AS YOU'RE MINE
COME BE HOW YOU WANT TO
AND SEE HOW BRIGHT WE SHINE!
BORROW THE MOONLIGHT
UNTIL IT IS THROUGH
AND KNOW I'LL BE HERE HOLDING YOU...
AS LONG AS YOU'RE MINE...
[BURR]
 What is it?
[HAMILTON] It's just... for the first time... I feel... wicked.

[HAMILTON] I just wish...
[BURR]
 What?
[HAMILTON] I wish I could be beautiful... for you.
[BURR]
 Elphaba...
[HAMILTON] Don't tell me that I am, you don't need to lie to me.
[BURR]
 It's not lying! It's... uh... it's looking at things another way. Someday, you and Glinda will make up and we'll all...
[HAMILTON] Shh! Listen... Do you hear that? A Shriek Is Heard In The Distance. It sounds like somebody in pain.
[BURR]
 It's just the wind.
[HAMILTON] The Siren Is Heard Again. My sister's in danger.
[BURR]
 What? How do you know?
[HAMILTON] I don't know, I just do... Gasps.
[BURR]
 Elphaba what's wrong, what is it?
[HAMILTON] This! Don't you see it?
[BURR]
 What do you mean? What do you see?
[HAMILTON] It doesn't make any sense... It's a house but it's... it's flying through the sky? I have to go to Nessa!
[BURR]
 I'll come with you!
[HAMILTON] No, you mustn't, it's too dangerous!
[BURR]
 Listen to me, listen! My family has a castle in Kiamo Ko. Now, no one is ever there except for the sentries who watch over it. We've never lived there.
[HAMILTON] Where do you live?
[BURR]
 In the other castle... It's the perfect hiding place; tunnels, secret passageways. You'll be safe there.
[HAMILTON] We will see each other again, won't we?
[BURR]
 Elphaba, we are going to be together always. You can see houses flying through the sky, can't you see that?
They Embrace And Elphaba Runs Off.
Glinda Enters. There Is A House In The Background. The Edge OF The Yellow Brick Road Can Be Seen.
[Burr] That's right, you just take that one road, the whole time. Waves offstage. Oh, I hope they don't get lost. I'm so bad at giving directions. She sees the house, picks up flowers and lays them in front of the house. Oh, Nessa.
Elphaba Appears.
[HAMILTON] What a touching display of grief.
[Burr] I don't think we have anything further to say to one another.
[HAMILTON] I wanted something to remember her by, and all that is left were those shoes, and now that wretched little farm girl has walked off with them. So I'd appreciate some time, alone, to say goodbye to my sister.
Glinda Backs Away As Elphaba Walks Toward The House.
[HAMILTON] Nessa, please, please, please forgive me...
[Burr] Elphie... you mustn't blame yourself. It's dreadful, it is, to have a house fall on you, but accidents will happen.
[HAMILTON] You call this an accident?
[Burr] Yes! Well, maybe not an accident...
[HAMILTON] Well, what do you call it?
[Burr] Well... a regime change. Caused by a bizarre and unexpected twister of fate.
[HAMILTON] You think cyclones just appear out of the blue?
[Burr] I don't know, I never really...
[HAMILTON] No, of course you never! You're too busy telling everyone how wonderful everything is!
[Burr] I'm a public figure, now. People expect me to...
[HAMILTON] Lie?
[Burr] Be encouraging! And what exactly have you been doing besides riding around on that filthy, old thing?
[HAMILTON] Well, we can't all come and go by bubble. Who's invention was that, the Wizard's? Of course, even if it wasn't I'm sure he'd still take credit for it.
[Burr] Yes, well, a lot of us are taking things that don't belong to us, aren't we?
[HAMILTON] Now wait just a clock tick! I know it may be difficult for that blissful, blonde brain of yours to comprehend that someone like him could actually choose someone like me! But it's happened... it's real. And you can wave that ridiculous wand all you want, you can't change it! He never belonged to you, he doesn't love you, and he never did! He loves me!
Glinda Slaps Her.
[HAMILTON] Cackles. Feel better now?
[Burr] Yes, I do.
[HAMILTON] Good, so do I.
She Slaps Glinda. Glinda Then Twirls Her Wand Skillfully And Elphaba Arms Herself With Her Broom. They Charge At Each Other And Then Drop Their "Weapons" And Beat Each Other Senselessly. Glinda Takes Elphaba's Hat Off Her Head And Begins To Whack Her With It. The Guards Run In.
[Guard]
 Halt! In the name of the Wizard!
They Grab Elphaba.
[HAMILTON] Stop! Let me go!
[Burr] Let me go, I almost had her!
[Guard]
 Sorry it took us so long to get here, Miss.
[HAMILTON] I can't believe you would sink this low! To use my sister's death as a trap to capture me?!
[Burr] I never meant for this to happen! Elphie!
Fiyero Swings In On A Rope.
[BURR]
 Let the green girl go!
[Burr] Fiyero, how in [Oz?
[BURR]
 I said let her go! Or explain to all Ozhow the Wizard's guards watched while Glinda the Good was slain.
[Burr] Fiyero...
[BURR]
 I said, let her go.
The Guards Release Her.
[BURR]
 Elphaba, go, now.
[HAMILTON] No, not without you.
[Burr] Fiyero, please.
[BURR]
 Hush! Now! Go!
Elphaba Hesitates.
[Burr] Do it!
She Runs Off.
[Guard]
 Seize him!
[Burr] Wait, what?! What are you doing? Stop it! In the name of goodness, stop! Don't you see? He wasn't going to harm me, he just... he just... he loves her.
[BURR]
 Glinda, I'm so sorry!
[Guard]
 Take him up to that field there! Put him on one of those poles until he tells us where the witch went.
They Drag Him Offstage.
[Burr] No, don't hurt him! Please, don't hurt him! Fiyero!!!!
[HAMILTON] Fiyero!!!!
ELEKA NAHMEN NAHMEN ATUM ATUM ELEKA NAHMEN
ELEKA NAHMEN NAHMEN ATUM ATUM ELEKA NAHMEN
LET HIS FLESH NOT BE TORN LET HIS BLOOD LEAVE NO STAIN,
WILL THEY BEAT HIM, LET HIM FEEL NO PAIN...
LET HIS BONES NEVER BREAK AND HOWEVER THEY TRY TO DESTROY HIM,
LET HIM NEVER DIE, LET HIM NEVER DIE!
ELEKA NAHMEN NAHMEN ATUM ATUM ELEKA NAHMEN
ELEKA NAHMEN NAHMEN ATUM ATUM ELEKA... ELEKA
AH! WHAT GOOD IS THIS CHANTING?
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT I'M READING
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT TRICK I OUGHT TO TRY!
FIYERO WHERE ARE YOU?! ALREADY DEAD OR BLEEDING?
ONE MORE DISASTER I CAN ADD TO MY GENEROUS SUPPLY!
NO GOOD DEED GOES UNPUNISHED
NO ACT OF CHARITY GOES UNRESENTED
NO GOOD DEED GOES UNPUNISHED
THAT'S MY NEW CREED
MY ROAD OF GOOD INTENTIONS
LED WHERE SUCH ROADS ALWAYS LEAD
NO GOOD DEED
GOES UNPUNISHED!
NESSA...
DOCTOR DILLAMOND...
FIYERO...
FIYERO!!!
ONE QUESTION HAUNTS AND HURTS
TOO MUCH, TOO MUCH TO MENTION
WAS I REALLY SEEKING GOOD
OR JUST SEEKING ATTENTION?
IS THAT ALL GOOD DEEDS ARE WHEN LOOKED AT WITH AN ICE COLD EYE?
IF THAT'S ALL GOOD DEEDS ARE
MAYBE THAT'S THE REASON WHY
NO GOOD DEED GOES UNPUNISHED
ALL HELPFUL URGES SHOULD BE CIRCUMVENTED
NO GOOD DEED GOES UNPUNISHED
SURE, I MEANT WELL, WELL LOOK AT WHAT WELL MEANT DID!
ALRIGHT, ENOUGH, SO BE IT!
SO BE IT THEN...
LET ALL OF OzBE AGREED
I'M WICKED THROUGH AND THROUGH
SINCE I COULD NOT SUCCEED
FIYERO SAVING YOU
I PROMISE NO GOOD DEED WILL I ATTEMPT TO DO AGAIN
EVER AGAIN!
NO GOOD DEAD, WILL I DO
AGAIN!!!!!!!!

[Ozia]

GO! AND HUNT HER AND FIND HER AND KILL HER!
Vicious Woman] Good fortune, witch hunters!

[Ozia]

GO! AND HUNT HER AND FIND HER AND KILL HER!
Rabid Man] Kill the witch!
[Ozia]

WICKEDNESS MUST BE PUNISHED
EVIL EFFECTIVELY ELIMINATED
WICKEDNESS MUST BE PUNISHED
KILL THE WITCH!
[Angelica]
 And, this is more than just a service to the Wizard. I have a personal score to settle with Elph... with the witch! Crowd Cheers.
IT'S DUE TO HER I'M MADE OF TIN
HER SPELL MADE THIS OCCUR
SO FOR ONCE I'M GLAD I'M HEARTLESS
I'LL BE HEARTLESS KILLING HER!
And I am not the only one. Looks Offstage. Oh, come on, you! Come out and tell them what she did to you in class that day. How you were just a cub and she cubnapped you.
Lion] No!
[Angelica]

YOU SEE THE LION ALSO
HAS A GRIEVANCE TO REPAY (Lion Roars)
IF SHE'D LET HIM FIGHT HIS OWN BATTLES WHEN HE WAS YOUNG,
HE WOULDN'T BE A COWARD TODAY!

[Burr] No, no, that's not the way it happened! Madame, you've got to stop this, it's gone too far!
[Morrible]
 Oh, I think Elphaba can take care of herself.
[Burr] Madame, something's been troubling me about Nessarose and that cyclone.
[Morrible]
 Oh yes... well, I guess it was just her time.
[Burr] Was it? Or did you...
[Morrible]
 After A Pause. Now, you listen to me, Missy, you may have fooled the rest of Ozwith this "aren't I good" routine, but you know better. You've wanted this since the beginning... and now you're getting what you wanted. So just smile and wave and shut up! Good fortune, good fortune witch hunters!
Rapid Man] Kill her!
Vicious Woman] Kill the witch!
WICKEDNESS MUST BE PUNISHED
BRAVE WITCH HUNTERS I WOULD JOIN YOU IF I COULD
BECAUSE WICKEDNESS MUST BE PUNISHED...
PUNISHED... PUNISHED...
BUT GOOD!!!
[HAMILTON] Oh, for [Oz's sake, stop crying!!! I can't listen to it anymore! Oh, you want to see your Aunt Em and your Uncle What's-his-name again?! Then get those shoes off your feet!!! Little brat... takes a dead woman's shoes; must have been raised in a barn! Chistery! Oh, Chistery, there you are. Where are the others? Chistery motions away. Chistery, please... if you don't at least try to keep speaking you will never... She Sees Glinda. Go away.
[Burr] They're coming for you.
[HAMILTON] Go away!
[Burr] Let the little girl go, and that poor little dog... Dodo.
[Burr] I know you don't want to hear this, but someone has to say it... You are out of control! I mean, come on! They're just shoes, let it go! Elphaba, you can't go on like this.
[HAMILTON] I can do anything I want. I am the Wicked Witch of the West! Another monkey Brings Her A Letter. At last! What took you so long? She Reads It. What's this? Why are you bothering me with this? She Reads On.
[Burr] What is it? What's wrong? It's Fiyero, isn't it? Is he...
[HAMILTON] We've seen his face for the last time.
[Burr] Oh no!
[HAMILTON] You're right... It's time I surrender. Carries A Bucket.
[Burr] Elphie.... Elphie, what is it?
[HAMILTON] You can't be found here! You must go. Refers To A Corner
[Burr] No.
[HAMILTON] You must leave.
[Burr] No! Elphie, I'll tell them everything.
[HAMILTON] No! They'll only turn against you.
[Burr] I don't care!
[HAMILTON] I do! Promise me, promise me, you won't try to clear my name... promise.
[Burr] Alright... I promise. But I don't understand.
[HAMILTON]
I'M LIMITED
JUST LOOK AT ME, I'M LIMITED
AND JUST LOOK AT YOU, YOU CAN DO ALL I COULDN'T DO, GLINDA

[HAMILTON] Here. Go on. Take this. Hands Her The Grimmerie.
[Burr] Elphie... you know I can't read that... Elphie...
[HAMILTON] Well then, you'll have to learn
NOW IT'S UP TO YOU
FOR BOTH OF US
NOW IT'S UP TO YOU
[HAMILTON] You're the only friend I've ever had.
[Burr] And I've had so many friends... but only one that mattered.

[Burr]
I'VE HEARD IT SAID
THAT PEOPLE COME INTO OUR LIVES FOR A REASON
BRINGING SOMETHING WE MUST LEARN
AND WE ARE LED TO THOSE
WHO HELP US MOST TO GROW
IF WE LET THEM
AND WE HELP THEM IN RETURN
WELL, I DON'T KNOW IF I BELIEVE THAT'S TRUE
BUT I KNOW I'M WHO I AM TODAY
BECAUSE I KNEW YOU
LIKE A COMMIT PULLED FROM ORBIT,

LIKE A STREAM THAT MEETS A BOULDER
HALF WAY THROUGH THE WOOD
WHO CAN SAY IF I'VE BEEN CHANGED FOR THE BETTER?
BUT, BECAUSE I KNEW YOU...
I HAVE BEEN CHANGED
FOR GOOD...
[HAMILTON]
IT WELL MAY BE,
THAT WE WILL NEVER MEET AGAIN
IN THIS LIFETIME
SO LET ME SAY BEFORE WE PART
SO MUCH OF ME

YOU'LL BE WITH ME
LIKE A HANDPRINT ON MY HEART...
AND NOW WHATEVER WAY OUR STORIES END
I KNOW YOU HAVE RE-WRITTEN MINE
BY BEING MY FRIEND...
LIKE A SHIP BLOWN FROM IT'S MOORING
BY A WIND OFF THE SEA
LIKE A SEA DROP BY A SKY BIRD
IN A DISTANT WOOD
WHO CAN SAY IF I'VE BEEN CHANGED FOR THE BETTER?
BUT BECAUSE I KNEW YOU
[Burr]
BECAUSE I KNEW YOU
Both]
I HAVE BEEN CHANGED...
FOR GOOD...
[HAMILTON]
AND JUST TO CLEAR THE AIR
I ASK FORGIVNESS FOR THE THINGS I'VE DONE
YOU BLAME ME FOR.
[Burr]
BUT THEN I GUESS, WE KNOW THERE'S BLAME TO SHARE
Both]
AND NONE OF IT SEEMS TO MATTER ANYMORE!
[Burr] LIKE A COMET PULLED FROM ORBIT AS IT PASSES A SUN...
[HAMILTON] LIKE A SHIP BLOWN FROM ITS MOORING BY A WIND OFF THE SEA
[Burr] LIKE A STREAM THAT MEETS A BOULDER
[HAMILTON] LIKE A SEA DROP BY A BIRD
[Burr] HALFWAY THROUGH THE WOOD
[HAMILTON] IN THE WOOD
[Burr]
WHO CAN SAY IF I'VE BEEN CHANGED FOR THE BETTER?
Both]
I DO BELIEVE I HAVE BEEN CHANGED FOR THE BETTER.
[Burr]
AND, BECAUSE I KNEW YOU
[HAMILTON]
BECAUSE I KNEW YOU
Both]
BECAUSE I KNEW YOU
I HAVE BEEN CHANGED
FOR GOOD...


[HAMILTON] You have to hide. No one can know you were here. Hide yourself!
Elphaba Drapes A Scrim Around The Stage
Offstage Chorus of Women]
AND GOODNESS KNOWS
THE WICKED'S LIVES ARE LONELY
GOODNESS KNOWS THE WICKED DIE ALONE...
LAFAYETE and Other Witch Hunters Run In. You Can See The Silhouette Of The Action Happening Behind The Scrim. Glinda Is Downstage Watching The Action Take Place.
The Mob Surrounds The Witch And She Melts With A Scream The Mob Leaves And Glinda Comes Out From Hiding. She Moves Near The Scrim.
[Burr] Elphie? Elphie? Chistery opens the scrim, where just Elphaba's hat and the green bottle remain. Glinda cries, and grabs the had, holding it against her.
Chistery] Handing Her The Bottle. Miss, Miss Glinda.
[Morrible]
 Well, I don't know why you're so despondiary, I thought it went quite well! They seem thrilled to shreds with their brains and their hearts, and this and that.... Glinda Enters. Oh, Miss Glinda! I thought you'd be out festivating.
[Burr] This was Elphaba's. Holding Out The Bottle.
[Hamilton]
What's that you say?
[Burr] It was a keepsake. It was her mother's. She told me so herself.
I've only seen a little, green bottle like this one other time. It was right here, in this very room. You offered me a drink from it.
Lover's Song Played In Background.
[Hamilton]
But... oh my Lord...
I AM A SENTIMENTAL MAN
WHO ALWAYS LONGED TO BE...
a father...
[Morrible]
 So that was it. That's why she had such powers! She was a child of both worlds!
[Hamilton]
He Cries.
[Burr] I want you to leave [Oz. I'll make the pronouncement myself]
that the strains of wizardship have been too much for you and you are taking an indefinite leave of absence! Did you hear what I said?!
[Hamilton]
Yes, your goodness.
[Burr] You'd better go get your balloon ready. Guards!
He Exits.
[Morrible]
 Glinda, dear, I know we've had our miniscule differentiations in the past...
[Burr] Guards! Madame, have you ever considered how you'd fare in captivity?
[Morrible]
 What?
[Burr] Articulated. Captivity... prison! Personally, I don't think you'll hold up very well.
My professional opinion is that you do not have what it takes. I hope you prove me wrong.
I doubt you will. Take her away!
[Morrible]
 No!!!!

[Ozia]

GOOD NEWS! SHE'S DEAD!
THE WITCH OF THE WEST IS DEAD!
THE WICKEDEST WITCH THERE EVER WAS
THE ENEMY OF ALL OF US, HERE IN [Oz,

GOOD NEWS
GOOD NEWS!!!
The Scarecrow (Fiyero) Walks On Stage. He Bends Down & Knocks On A Trap Door In The Floor.
[BURR]
 It worked!
He Opens The Door & Elphaba Climbs Out.
[HAMILTON] Fiyero! I thought you'd never get here.
She Touches His Straw Face.
[BURR]
 Go ahead, touch, I don't mind. Ah, you did the best you could. You saved my life.
[HAMILTON] You're still beautiful.
[BURR]
 You don't have to lie to me.
[HAMILTON] It's not lying... its looking at things another way.
[Ozia]

NO ONE MOURNS THE WICKED
NOW AT LAST SHE'S DEAD AND GONE!
NOW AT LAST THERE'S JOY THROUGHOUT THE LAND!
[Burr] Fellow [Ozians, friends, we have been through a frightening time. There will be other times
and other things that frighten us. But if you let me, I'd like to try to help. I'd like to try to be... Glinda the Good.
[Ozia]

GOOD NEWS!!
[BURR]
 It's time to go.
[HAMILTON] We can never come back to [Oz, can we?
[BURR]
 No.
[HAMILTON] I only wish...
[BURR]
 What?
[HAMILTON] Glinda could know that we're alive.
[BURR]
 She can't know, not if we want to be safe. No one can ever know.
[Ozia]

GOOD NEWS...
[BURR]
 Come...
[Burr]
WHO CAN SAY IF I'VE BEEN CHANGED FOR THE BETTER? BUT...
Elphaba & [Burr]
BECAUSE I KNEW YOU...
[Ozia]

NO ONE MOURNS THE WICKED...
[Burr]
BECAUSE I KNEW YOU...
Elphaba & [Burr]
I HAVE BEEN CHANGED...
Fiyero and Elphaba Leave Through The Clock

Aaron Burr, Sir

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[COMPANY]
1776. New York City

[HAMILTON]
Pardon me. Are you Aaron Burr, sir?

[BURR]
That depends. Who's asking?

[HAMILTON]
Oh, well, sure, sir
I'm Alexander Hamilton, I'm at your service, sir
I have been looking for you

[BURR]
I'm getting nervous

[HAMILTON]
Sir...
I heard your name at Princeton. I was seeking an accelerated course of study when I got sort of out of sorts with a buddy of yours. I may have punched him. It's a blur, sir. He handles the financials?

[BURR]
You punched the bursar

[HAMILTON]
Yes!
I wanted to do what you did. Graduate in two, then join the revolution. He looked at me like I was stupid, I'm not stupid

So how'd you do it? How'd you graduate so fast?

[BURR]
It was my parents' dying wish before they passed

[HAMILTON]
You're an orphan. Of course! I'm an orphan
God, I wish there was a war!
Then we could prove that we're worth more
Than anyone bargained for...

[BURR]
Can I buy you a drink?

[HAMILTON]
That would be nice

[BURR]
While we're talking, let me offer you some free advice
Talk less

[HAMILTON]
What?

[BURR]
Smile more

[HAMILTON]
Ha

[BURR]
Don't let them know what you're against or what you're for

[HAMILTON]
You can't be serious

[BURR]
You wanna get ahead?

[HAMILTON]
Yes

[BURR]
Fools who run their mouths off wind up dead

[LAURE]

Yo yo yo yo yo!
What time is it?

[LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
Show time!

[BURR]
...like I said...

[LAURE]

Show time! Show time! Yo!
I'm John Laurens in the place to be!
Two pints o' Sam Adams, but I'm workin' on three, uh!
Those redcoats don't want it with me!
Cuz I will pop chick-a pop these cops till I'm free!

[LAFAYETTE]
Oui oui, mon ami, je m'appelle Lafayette!
The Lancelot of the revolutionary set!
I came from afar just to say "Bonsoir!"
Tell the King "Casse toi!" Who's the best?
C'est moi!

[MULLIGAN]
Brrrah brraaah! I am Hercules Mulligan
Up in it, lovin' it, yes I heard ya mother said "Come again?"
Lock up ya daughters and horses, of course
It's hard to have intercourse over four sets of corsets...

[LAURE]

No more sex, pour me another brew, son!
Let's raise a couple more...

[LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
To the revolution!

[LAURE]

Well, if it ain't the prodigy of Princeton college!

[MULLIGAN]
Aaron Burr!

[LAURE]

Give us a verse, drop some knowledge!

[BURR]
Good luck with that] you're takin' a stand
You spit. I'm ‘a sit. We'll see where we land

[LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
Boooo!

[LAURE]

Burr, the revolution's imminent. What do you stall for?

[HAMILTON]
If you stand for nothing, Burr, what'll you fall for?
[LAURE]

Ooh

My Shot

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[HAMILTON]
I am not throwing away my shot!
I am not throwing away my shot!
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot!
I'm ‘a get a scholarship to King's College
I prob'ly shouldn't brag, but dag, I amaze and astonish
The problem is I got a lot of brains but no polish
I gotta holler just to be heard
With every word, I drop knowledge!
I'm a diamond in the rough, a shiny piece of coal
Tryin' to reach my goal. My power of speech] unimpeachable
Only nineteen but my mind is older
These New York City streets get colder, I shoulder
Ev'ry burden, ev'ry disadvantage
I have learned to manage, I don't have a gun to brandish
I walk these streets famished
The plan is to fan this spark into a flame
But damn, it's getting dark, so let me spell out the name
I am the-

[HAMILTON/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN/LAURE]

A-L-E-X-A-N-D
E-R-we are-meant to be...

[HAMILTON]
A colony that runs independently
Meanwhile, Britain keeps shittin' on us endlessly
Essentially, they tax us relentlessly
Then King George turns around, runs a spending spree
He ain't ever gonna set his descendants free
So there will be a revolution in this century
Enter me!

[LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN/LAURE]

(He says in parentheses)

[HAMILTON]
Don't be shocked when your hist'ry book mentions me
I will lay down my life if it sets us free
Eventually, you'll see my ascendancy
[HAMILTON]
And I am not throwing away
My shot
I am not throwing away
My shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot
[LAURE]

My shot!

My shot!

And I'm not throwing away my shot.

[HAMILTON/MULLIGAN/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE]
I am not throwing away my shot
I am not throwing away my shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot
It's time to take a shot!

[LAFAYETTE]
I dream of life without a monarchy
The unrest in France will lead to ‘onarchy?
‘Onarchy? How you say, how you say, ‘anarchy?'
When I fight, I make the other side panicky
With my-

[HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
Shot!

[MULLIGAN]
Yo, I'm a tailor's apprentice
And I got y'all knuckleheads in loco parentis
I'm joining the rebellion cuz I know it's my chance
To socially advance, instead of sewin' some pants!
I'm gonna take a-

[HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
Shot!

[LAURE]

But we'll never be truly free
Until those in bondage have the same rights as you and me
You and I. Do or die. Wait till I sally in
On a stallion with the first black battalion
Have another-

[HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
Shot!

[BURR]
Geniuses, lower your voices
You keep out of trouble and you double your choices
I'm with you, but the situation is fraught
You've got to be carefully taught]
If you talk, you're gonna get shot!

[HAMILTON]
Burr, check what we got
Mister Lafayette, hard rock like Lancelot
I think your pants look hot
Laurens, I like you a lot
Let's hatch a plot blacker than the kettle callin' the pot...
What are the odds the gods would put us all in one spot
Poppin' a squat on conventional wisdom, like it or not
A bunch of revolutionary manumission abolitionists?
Give me a position, show me where the ammunition is!

Oh, am I talkin' too loud?
Sometimes I get over excited, shoot off at the mouth
I never had a group of friends before
I promise that I'll make y'all proud

[LAURE]

Let's get this guy in front of a crowd

[HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN/ENSEMBLE]
I am not throwing away my shot
I am not throwing away my shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot

I am not throwing away my shot
I am not throwing away my shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot
[LAURE]

Ev'rybody sing]
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Hey!
Whoa!
Wooh!!
Whoa!
Ay, let ‘em hear ya!

Let's go!

I said shout it to the rooftops!

Rise up!

Whoa! Whoa!

[HAMILTON]
I imagine death so much it feels more like a memory
When's it gonna get me?
In my sleep? Seven feet ahead of me?
If I see it comin', do I run or do I let it be?
Is it like a beat without a melody?
See, I never thought I'd live past twenty
Where I come from some get half as many
Ask anybody why we livin' fast and we laugh, reach for a flask
We have to make this moment last, that's plenty

Scratch that
This is not a moment, it's the movement
Where all the hungriest brothers with
Something to prove went?
Foes oppose us, we take an honest stand
We roll like Moses, claimin' our promised land
And? If we win our independence?
‘Zat a guarantee of freedom for our descendants?
Or will the blood we shed begin an endless
Cycle of vengeance and death with no defendants?
I know the action in the street is excitin'
But Jesus, between all the bleedin' ‘n fightin'
I've been readin' ‘n writin'
We need to handle our financial situation
Are we a nation of states? What's the state of our nation?
I'm past patiently waitin'. I'm passionately
Smashin' every expectation
Every action's an act of creation!
I'm laughin' in the face of casualties and sorrow
For the first time, I'm thinkin' past tomorrow

[HAMILTON AND COMPANY]
And I am not throwing away my shot
I am not throwing away my shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country

Farmer Refuted

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[SEABURY]
Hear ye, hear ye! My name is Samuel Seabury
And I present "Free Thoughts on the
Proceedings of the Continental Congress!"
Heed not the rabble who scream revolution
They have not your interests at heart

[MULLIGAN]
Oh my God. Tear this dude apart

[SEABURY]
Chaos and bloodshed are not a solution
Don't let them lead you astray
This Congress does not speak for me

[BURR]
Let him be

[SEABURY]
They're playing a dangerous game
I pray the king shows you his mercy
For shame, for shame...
[HAMILTON]
Yo!
He'd have you all unravel at the
Sound of screams but the
Revolution is comin'
The have-nots are gonna
Win this
It's hard to listen to you with a straight face

Chaos and bloodshed already haunt us, honestly you shouldn't even talk. And what about Boston? Look at the cost, n' all that we've lost n' you talk
About Congress?!

My dog speaks more eloquently than thee!

But strangely, your mange is the same

Is he in Jersey?

For the revolution!
[SEABURY]
Heed not the rabble
Who scream
Revolution, they
Have not your
Interests
At heart

Chaos and bloodshed are
Not a
Solution. Don't
Let them lead you
Astray
This Congress does not
Speak for me

They're playing a dangerous game

I pray the king shows you his mercy

For shame

For shame,

[COMPANY]
For the revolution!

[SEABURY]
Heed-

[HAMILTON]
If you repeat yourself again I'm gonna-

[SEABURY/HAMILTON]
Scream-

[HAMILTON]
Honestly, look at me, please don't read!

[SEABURY]
Not your interests-

[HAMILTON]
Don't modulate the key then not debate with me!
Why should a tiny island across the sea regulate the price of tea?

[BURR]
Alexander, please!

[HAMILTON]

You'll Be Back

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[KING GEORGE]
You say
The price of my love's not a price that you're willing to pay
You cry
In your tea which you hurl in the sea when you see me go by
Why so sad?
Remember we made an arrangement when you went away
Now you're making me mad
Remember, despite our estrangement, I'm your man
You'll be back
Soon you'll see
You'll remember you belong to me
You'll be back
Time will tell
You'll remember that I served you well
Oceans rise
Empires fall
We have seen each other through it all
And when push
Comes to shove
I will send a fully armed battalion
To remind you of my love!

Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da
Da da dat dat da ya da!
Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da
Da da dat dat da...

You say our love is draining and you can't go on
You'll be the one complaining when I am gone...
And no, don't change the subject
Cuz you're my favorite subject
My sweet, submissive subject
My loyal, royal subject
Forever and ever and ever and ever and ever...

You'll be back
Like before
I will fight the fight and win the war
For your love
For your praise
And I'll love you till my dying days
When you're gone
I'll go mad
So don't throw away this thing we had

Cuz when push comes to shove
I will kill your friends and family to remind you of my love
Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da
Da da dat dat da ya da!
Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da
Da da dat-
Everybody!

[ENSEMBLE]
Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da
Da da dat dat da ya da!
Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da da da da
Dat dat da ya da!

British Admiral Howe's got troops on the water
Thirty-two thousand troops in New York harbor

[HAMILTON]
As a kid in the Caribbean I wished for a war
I knew that I was poor
I knew it was the only way to-

[HAMILTON/BURR/MULLIGAN/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE]
Rise up!

[HAMILTON]
If they tell my story
I am either gonna die on the battlefield in glory or-

[HAMILTON/BURR/MULLIGAN/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE]
Rise up!

[HAMILTON]
We will fight for this land
But there's only one man
Who can give us a command so we can-

[HAMILTON/BURR/MULLIGAN/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE]
Rise up!

[HAMILTON]
Understand? It's the only way to-

[HAMILTON/BURR/MULLIGAN/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE]
Rise up! Rise up!

George Washington!
[WASHINGTON]
We are outgunned

Outmanned

Outplanned

We gotta make an all out stand
Ayo, I'm gonna need a right-hand man.
ENSEMBLE
What?

What?

Buck, buck, buck, buck, buck!

Buck, buck, buck, buck, buck!

[WASHINGTON]
Check it-
Can I be real a second?
For just a millisecond?
Let down my guard and tell the people how I feel a second?
Now I'm the model of a modern major general
The venerated Virginian veteran whose men are all
Lining up, to put me up on a pedestal
Writin' letters to relatives
Embellishin' my elegance and eloquence
But the elephant is in the room
The truth is in ya face when ya hear the British cannons go...

[ENSEMBLE]
Boom!

[WASHINGTON]
Any hope of success is fleeting
How can I keep leading when the people I'm
Leading keep retreating?
We put a stop to the bleeding as the British take Brooklyn
Knight takes rook, but look
[WASHINGTON]
We are outgunned

Outmanned

Outnumbered
Outplanned

We gotta make an all out stand
Ayo, I'm gonna need a right-hand man

Incoming!
[ENSEMBLE]
What?

What?

Buck, buck, buck, buck, buck!

Buck, buck, buck, buck, buck!

[HAMILTON]
They're battering down the Battery check the damages

[MULLIGAN]
Rah!

[HAMILTON]
We gotta stop ‘em and rob ‘em of their advantages

[MULLIGAN]
Rah!

[HAMILTON]
Let's take a stand with the stamina God has granted us
Hamilton won't abandon ship
Yo, let's steal their cannons-
[MULLIGAN]
Shh-boom! [COMPANY]
Boom!

[WASHINGTON]
Goes the cannon, watch the blood and the shit spray and...

[COMPANY]
Boom!

[WASHINGTON]
Goes the cannon, we're abandonin' Kips Bay and...

[COMPANY]
Boom!

[WASHINGTON]
There's another ship and...

[COMPANY]
Boom!

[WASHINGTON]
We just lost the southern tip and...

[COMPANY]
Boom!

[WASHINGTON]
We gotta run to Harlem quick, we can't afford another slip
Guns and horses giddyup
I decide to divvy up
My forces, they're skittish as the British cut the city up
This close to giving up, facing mad scrutiny
I scream in the face of this mass mutiny]
Are these the men with which I am to defend America?
We ride at midnight, Manhattan in the distance
I cannot be everywhere at once, people
I'm in dire need of assistance...

[BURR]
Your excellency, sir!

[WASHINGTON]
Who are you?

[BURR]
Aaron Burr, Sir?
Permission to state my case?

[WASHINGTON]
As you were

[BURR]
Sir
I was a captain under General Montgomery
Until he caught a bullet in the neck in Quebec
And well, in summary
I think that I could be of some assistance
I admire how you keep firing on the British
From a distance

[WASHINGTON]
Huh

[BURR]
I have some questions, a couple of suggestions on how to fight instead of fleeing west

[WASHINGTON]
Yes?

[BURR]
Well-

[HAMILTON]
Your excellency, you wanted to see me?

[WASHINGTON]
Hamilton, come in, have you met Burr?

[HAMILTON]
Yes, sir

[HAMILTON AND BURR]
We keep meeting

[BURR]
As I was saying, sir, I look forward to seeing your strategy play out

[WASHINGTON]
Burr?

[BURR]
Sir?

[WASHINGTON]
Close the door on your way out

[HAMILTON]
Have I done something wrong, sir?

[WASHINGTON]
On the contrary
I called you here because our odds are beyond scary
Your reputation precedes you, but I have to laugh

[HAMILTON]
Sir?

[WASHINGTON]
Hamilton, how come no one can get you on their staff?

[HAMILTON]
Sir!

[WASHINGTON]
Don't get me wrong, you're a young man, of great renown
I know you stole British cannons when we were still downtown
Nathaniel Green and Henry Knox wanted to hire you...

[HAMILTON]
To be their Secretary? I don't think so

[WASHINGTON]
Why're you upset?

[HAMILTON]
I'm not-

[WASHINGTON]
It's alright, you want to fight, you've got a hunger
I was just like you when I was younger
Head full of fantasies of dyin' like a martyr?

[HAMILTON]
Yes

[WASHINGTON]
Dying is easy, young man. Living is harder

[HAMILTON]
Why are you telling me this?

[WASHINGTON]
I'm being honest
I'm working with a third of what our Congress has promised
We are a powder keg about to explode
I need someone like you to lighten the load. So?

[COMPANY (EXCEPT HAMILTON)]
I am not throwin' away my shot!
I am not throwin' away my shot!
Ayo, I'm just like my country, I'm young
Scrappy and hungry!

[HAMILTON]
I am not throwing away my shot!

[WASHINGTON]
Son

[WASHINGON AND COMPANY]
We are outgunned, outmanned!

[HAMILTON]
You need all the help you can get
I have some friends. Laurens, Mulligan
Marquis de Lafayette, okay, what else?

[WASHINGTON AND COMPANY]
Outnumbered, outplanned!

[HAMILTON]
We'll need some spies on the inside
Some King's men who might let some things slide
[HAMILTON]
I'll write to Congress and tell ‘em we need supplies, you rally the guys, master the element of surprise

I'll rise above my station, organize your information, ‘til we rise to the occasion of our new nation. Sir!

[ENSEMBLE]
Here comes the General!

A Winter's Ball

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[BURR]
How does the bastard, orphan, son of a whore
Go on and on
Grow into more of a phenomenon?
Watch this obnoxious, arrogant, loudmouth bother
Be seated at the right hand of the father
Washington hires Hamilton right on sight
But Hamilton still wants to fight, not write
Now Hamilton's skill with a quill is undeniable
But what do we have in common? We're
Reliable with the

[ALL MEN]
Ladies!

[BURR]
There are so many to deflower!

[ALL MEN]
Ladies!

[BURR]
Looks! Proximity to power

They delighted and distracted him
Martha Washington named her feral tomcat after him!

[HAMILTON]
That's true

[FULL COMPANY]
1780

[BURR]
A winter's ball
And the Schuyler sisters are the envy of all
Yo, if you can marry a sister, you're rich, son

Is it a question of if, Burr, or which one?

Helpless

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[HAMILTON/BURR/LAURENS/ALL WOMEN (EXCEPT ELIZA)]
Hey hey hey hey
[ELIZA]
Ohh, I do I do I do I
Dooo! Hey!
Ohh, I do I do I do I
Dooo! Boy you got me [ALL WOMEN]
Hey hey hey hey
Hey hey hey hey
Hey hey hey hey
Hey hey hey

[ELIZA AND WOMEN]
Helpless!
Look into your eyes, and the sky's the limit I'm helpless!
Down for the count, and I'm drownin' in ‘em

[ELIZA]
I have never been the type to try and grab the spotlight
We were at a revel with some rebels on a hot night
Laughin' at my sister as she's dazzling the room
Then you walked in and my heart went "Boom!"
Tryin' to catch your eye from the side of the ballroom
Everybody's dancin' and the band's top volume

[ELIZA AND WOMEN]
Grind to the rhythm as we wine and dine
[ELIZA]
Grab my sister, and
Whisper, "Yo, this
One's mine."

My sister made her way across the room to you
And I got nervous, thinking "What's she gonna do?"
She grabbed you by the arm, I'm thinkin' "I'm through"
Then you look back at me and suddenly I'm
Helpless!

Oh, look at those eyes

Oh!
Yeah, I'm
Helpless, I know

I'm so into you
I am so into you

I know I'm down for the count
And I'm drownin' in ‘em.

[ALL WOMEN]
Oooh

Oooh

Oooh

Oooh

Helpless!

Look into your eyes
And the sky's the limit
I'm
Helpless!
Down for the count
And I'm drownin' in ‘em

I'm helpless!

Look into your eyes
And the sky's the limit I'm helpless!

Down for the count
And I'm drownin' in ‘em.

[HAMILTON]
Where are you taking me?

[ANGELICA]
I'm about to change your life

[HAMILTON]
Then by all means, lead the way

[ELIZA]
Elizabeth Schuyler. It's a pleasure to meet you

[HAMILTON]
Schuyler?

[ANGELICA]
My sister

[ELIZA]
Thank you for all your service

[HAMILTON]
If it takes fighting a war for us to meet, it will have been worth it

[ANGELICA]
I'll leave you to it

[ELIZA AND WOMEN]
One week later

[ELIZA]
I'm writin' a letter nightly
Now my life gets better, every letter that you write me
Laughin' at my sister, cuz she wants to form a harem

[ANGELICA]
I'm just sayin', if you really loved me, you would share him
[ELIZA]
Ha!
Two weeks later
In the living room stressin'
My father's stone-faced
While you're asking for his blessin'
I'm dying inside, as
You wine
And dine
And I'm tryin' not to cry
‘cause there's nothing that your mind can't do
My father makes his way across the room
To you
I panic for a second, thinking
"we're through"
But then he shakes your hand and says
"Be true"
And you turn back to me, smiling, and I'm
Helpless!

Helpless!
Hoo!

That boy is mine
That boy is mine!

Helpless! Helpless!
Down for the count
And I'm drownin' in em

[ALL WOMEN]
Stressin'

Blessin'

Oooh

Oooh

Look into your eyes

And I'm drownin' in
‘em I'm
Helpless!

Look into your eyes
And the sky's the
Limit I'm
Helpless!
Down for the count
And I'm drownin' in em

[HAMILTON]
Eliza, I don't have a dollar to my name
An acre of land, a troop to command, a dollop of fame
All I have's my honor, a tolerance for pain
A couple of college credits and my top-notch brain
Insane, your family brings out a different side of me
Peggy confides in me, Angelica tried to take a bite of me
No stress, my love for you is never in doubt
We'll get a little place in Harlem and we'll figure it out
I've been livin' without a family since I was a child
My father left, my mother died, I grew up buckwild
But I'll never forget my mother's face, that was real
And long as I'm alive, Eliza, swear to God
You'll never feel so...

[HAMILTON]
Eliza...

I've never felt so-

My life is gon' be fine cuz Eliza's in it.
[ELIZA]
I do I do I do I do!

I do I do I do I do!

Hey, yeah, yeah!

I'm down for the count
I'm-

I look into your eyes, and the sky's the limit
I'm

...drownin' in ‘em. [ALL WOMEN]
Helpless!

Helpless!

Helpless!

Down for the count
And I'm drownin' in ‘em

Helpless!

Satisfied

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[LAURE]

Alright, alright. That's what I'm talkin' about!
Now everyone give it up for the maid of honor
Angelica Schuyler!
[ANGELICA]
A toast to the groom!

To the bride!

From your sister

Who is always by your side

To your union

And the hope that you provide

May you always...

Be satisfied.

[ALL MEN]
To the groom!
To the groom!
To the groom!

To the bride!
To the bride!

Angelica!
Angelica!
Angelica!

By your side!

To the union!
To the revolution!

You provide!
You provide!

[HAMILTON AND MEN]
Always-

Rewind-

[ALL WOMEN]
To the groom!

To the bride!

To the bride!

[ELIZA AND WOMEN]
Angelica!

By your side!

To the union!
To the revolution!

You provide!

Always-

Rewind-

[ANGELICA]
I remember that night, I just might
Regret that night for the rest of my days

I remember those soldier boys
Tripping over themselves to win our praise

I remember that dreamlike candlelight
Like a dream that you can't quite place

But Alexander, I'll never forget the first
Time I saw your face

I have never been the same
Intelligent eyes in a hunger-pang frame
And when you said "Hi," I forgot my dang name
Set my heart aflame, ev'ry part aflame

[FULL COMPANY]
This is not a game...

[HAMILTON]
You strike me as a woman who has never been satisfied

[ANGELICA]
I'm sure I don't know what you mean. You forget yourself

[HAMILTON]
You're like me. I'm never satisfied

[ANGELICA]
Is that right?

[HAMILTON]
I have never been satisfied

[ANGELICA]
My name is Angelica Schuyler

[HAMILTON]
Alexander Hamilton

[ANGELICA]
Where's your fam'ly from?

[HAMILTON]
Unimportant. There's a million things I haven't done but
Just you wait, just you wait...

[ANGELICA]
So so so-
So this is what it feels like to match wits
With someone at your level! What the hell is the catch? It's
The feeling of freedom, of seein' the light
It's Ben Franklin with a key and a kite! You see it, right?
The conversation lasted two minutes, maybe three minutes
Ev'rything we said in total agreement, it's
A dream and it's a bit of a dance
A bit of a posture, it's a bit of a stance. He's a
Bit of a flirt, but I'm ‘a give it a chance
I asked about his fam'ly, did you see his answer?
His hands started fidgeting, he looked askance?
He's penniless, he's flying by the seat of his pants

Handsome, boy, does he know it!
Peach fuzz, and he can't even grow it!
I wanna take him far away from this place
Then I turn and see my sister's face and she is...

[ELIZA]
Helpless...

[ANGELICA]
And I know she is...

[ELIZA]
Helpless...

[ANGELICA]
And her eyes are just...

[ELIZA]
Helpless...

[ANGELICA]
And I realize

[ANGELICA AND COMPANY]
Three fundamental truths at the exact same time...

[HAMILTON]
Where are you taking me?

[ANGELICA]
I'm about to change your life

[HAMILTON]
Then by all means, lead the way

[COMPANY (EXCEPT ANGELICA)]
Number one!

[ANGELICA]
I'm a girl in a world in which
My only job is to marry rich
My father has no sons so I'm the one
Who has to social climb for one
So I'm the oldest and the wittiest and the gossip in
New York City is insidious
Alexander is penniless
Ha! That doesn't mean I want him any less

[ELIZA]
Elizabeth Schuyler. It's a pleasure to meet you

[HAMILTON]
Schuyler?

[ANGELICA]
My sister

[COMPANY]
Number two!

[ANGELICA]
He's after me cuz I'm a Schuyler sister
That elevates his status, I'd
Have to be naïve to set that aside
Maybe that is why I introduce him to Eliza
Now that's his bride
Nice going, Angelica, he was right
You will never be satisfied

[ELIZA]
Thank you for all your service

[HAMILTON]
If it takes fighting a war for us to meet, it will have been worth it

[ANGELICA]
I'll leave you to it

[COMPANY]
Number three!

[ANGELICA]
I know my sister like I know my own mind
You will never find anyone as trusting or as kind
If I tell her that I love him she'd be silently resigned
He'd be mine
She would say, "I'm fine"

[ANGELICA AND COMPANY]
She'd be lying

[ANGELICA]
But when I fantasize at night
It's Alexander's eyes
As I romanticize what might
Have been if I hadn't sized him
Up so quickly
At least my dear Eliza's his wife;
At least I keep his eyes in my life...
[ANGELICA]
To the groom!

To the bride!

From your sister

Who is always by your side

To your union

And the hope that you provide

May you always

Be satisfied

And I know

She'll be happy as

His bride
And I know [ALL MEN (EXCEPT HAMILTON)]
To the groom!
To the groom!
To the groom!

To the bride!
To the bride!

Angelica!
Angelica!

By your side

To the union!
To the revolution!

You provide!
You provide!

[HAMILTON AND MEN]
Always-

Be satisfied

Be satisfied

[MEN]
Be satisfied
Be satisfied
Be satisfied

Be satisfied
Be satisfied

Be satisfied
Be satisfied
Be satisfied

[ALL WOMEN (EXCEPT ELIZA)]

The Story of Tonight (Reprise)

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[LAURE]

I may not live to see our glory!

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE]
I may not live to see our glory!

[LAURE]

But I've seen wonders great and small

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE]
I've seen wonders great and small

[LAURE]

‘Cause if the tomcat can get married

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE]
If Alexander can get married-

[LAURE]

There's hope for our ass, after all!

[LAFAYETTE]
Raise a glass to freedom

[LAURENS/MULLIGAN]
Hey!
Something you will never see again!

[MULLIGAN]
No matter what she tells you

[LAFAYETTE]
Let's have another round tonight!

[LAURE]

Raise a glass to the four of us!

[LAFAYETTE/HAMILTON]
Ho!

[MULLIGAN]
To the newly not poor of us!

[LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/HAMILTON]
Woo!

[LAFAYETTE]
We'll tell the story of tonight

[LAURE]

Let's have another round-

[HAMILTON]
Well, if it isn't Aaron Burr

[BURR]
Sir!

[HAMILTON]
I didn't think that you would make it

[BURR]
To be sure

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE]
Burr!

[BURR]
I came to say congratulations

[MULLIGAN]
Spit a verse, Burr!

[BURR]
I see the whole gang is here

[LAFAYETTE]
You are the worst, Burr!

[HAMILTON]
Ignore them. Congrats to you, Lieutenant Colonel
I wish I had your command instead of manning George's journal

[BURR]
No, you don't

[HAMILTON]
Yes, I do

[BURR]
Now, be sensible
From what I hear, you've made yourself indispensable

[LAURE]

Well, well, I heard
You've got a special someone on the side, Burr

[HAMILTON]
Is that so?

[LAURE]

What are you tryin' to hide, Burr?

[BURR]
I should go

[HAMILTON]
No, these guys should go

[LAFAYETTE]
What?

[LAURE]

No!

[HAMILTON]
Leave us alone

[MULLIGAN]
Man...

[HAMILTON]
It's alright, Burr. I wish you'd brought this girl with you tonight, Burr

[BURR]
You're very kind, but I'm afraid it's unlawful, sir

[HAMILTON]
What do you mean?

[BURR]
She's married

[HAMILTON]
I see

[BURR]
She's married to a British officer

[HAMILTON]
Oh shit...

[BURR]
Congrats again, Alexander. Smile more
I'll see you on the other side of the war

[HAMILTON]
I will never understand you
If you love this woman, go get her! What are you waiting for?

[BURR]
I'll see you on the other side of the war

[HAMILTON]
I'll see you on the other side of the war

Wait For It

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[BURR]
Theodosia writes me a letter everyday
I'm keeping the bed warm while her husband is away
He's on the British side in Georgia
He's trying to keep the colonies in line
But he can keep all of Georgia
Theodosia, she's mine

Love doesn't discriminate
Between the sinners
And the saints
It takes and it takes and it takes
And we keep loving anyway
We laugh and we cry
And we break
And we make our mistakes
And if there's a reason I'm by her side
When so many have tried
Then I'm willing to wait for it
I'm willing to wait for it
[BURR]
My grandfather was a fire and brimstone preacher

But there are things that the
Homilies and hymns won't teach ya

My mother was a genius

My father commanded respect

When they died they left no instructions
Just a legacy to protect

[MEN]
Preacher, preacher
Preacher

Teach ya, teach ya, teach ya

Respect, respect

[WOMEN]
Genius

GOOD NEWS, SHE'S DEAD!
THE WITCH OF THE WEST IS DEAD!

 It's good to see me, isn't it? ([Ozians Agree) No need to respond that was rhetorical. Fellow [Ozia]


[BURR]
LET US BE GLAD,
LET US BE GRATEFUL,
LET US REJOICIFY THAT GOODNESS COULD SUBDUE
THE WICKED WORKINGS OF YOU KNOW WHO!
ISN'T IT NICE TO KNOW
THAT GOOD WILL CONQUER EVIL?
THE TRUTH WE ALL BELIEVE'LL BY AND BY
OUTLIVE A LIE
FOR YOU AND...

[BURR]
Glinda! Exactly how dead is she?

[[Burr] Well, there has been much rumor and speculation... innuendo, outuendo...
but let me set the record straight. According to the Time Dragon Clock, the melting occurred at the 13th hour;
a direct result of a bucket of water thrown by a female child. Yes, the Wicked Witch of the West is dead!

[Ozian]
NO ONE MOURNS THE WICKED!

[Ozian]
NO ONE CRIES THEY WON'T RETURN!

[Ozia]

NO ONE LAYS A LILY ON THEIR GRAVE!
[Ozian Man]
THE GOOD MAN SCORNS THE WICKED!

THROUGH THEIR LIVES OUR CHILDREN LEARN!

[Ozia]

WHAT WE MISS WHEN WE MISBEHAVE!

IT JUST SHOWS WHEN YOU'RE WICKED
YOU'RE LEFT ONLY
ON YOUR OWN

YES, GOODNESS KNOWS
THE WICKEDS' LIVES ARE LONELY
GOODNESS KNOWS
THE WICKED CRY ALONE
NOTHING GROWS FOR THE WICKED
THEY REAP ONLY
WHAT THEY'VE SEWN
[Ozian] Glinda, why does wickedness happen?
[Burr] That's a good question; one that many people find confusifying. Are people born wicked,
or do they have wickedness thrust upon them? After all, she had a childhood,;
She had a father, who just happed to be the governor of munchlinkland Witch's Parents Enter.

[Frex]
 I'm off to the assembly, dear.
[Burr] She had a mother, as so many do...
[Frex]

HOW I HATE TO GO AND LEAVE YOU LONELY
Melena]
THAT'S ALRIGH IT'S ONLY JUST ONE NIGHT
[Frex]

BUT KNOW THAT YOU'RE HERE, IN MY HEART
WHILE I'M OUT OF YOUR SIGHT!
Frex Exits. A Lover Runs Into The Room.
[Burr] And like all families, they had their secrets.
Lover]
HAVE ANOTHER DRINK, MY DARK EYED BEAUTY,
I'VE GOT ONE MORE NIGHT LEFT HERE IN TOWN,
SO HAVE ANOTHER DRINK OF GREEN ELIXER
AND WE'LL HAVE OURSELVES A LITTLE MIXER
HAVE ANOTHER LITTLE SWALLOW LITTLE LADY,
AND FOLLOW ME DOWN
[Burr] And of course, from the moment she was born she was... well... different!
Midwife] AHHH!! It's coming!
[Frex]
 Now?
Midwife] The baby's coming!
[Frex]
 And how!

Midwife]
I SEE A NOSE!
[Frex]

I SEE A CURL!
Both]
IT'S A HEALTHY, PERFECT, LOVELY LITTLE...
(They Scream)
Melena] What is it? What's wrong?
Midwife]
HOW CAN IT BE?
[Frex]

WHAT DOES IT MEAN?
Midwife]
IT'S ATTROCIOUS!
[Frex]

IT'S OBSCENE!
Both]
LIKE A FROGGY, FERNY CABBAGE,
THE BABY IS UNATURALLY
GREEN!!!
[Frex]
 Take it away... Take it away!!!!
[Burr] So you see, it couldn't have been easy!

Munchki]

NO ONE MOURNS THE WICKED!
NOW AT LAST, SHE'S DEAD AND GONE!
NOW AT LAST THERE'S JOY THROUGHOUT THE LAND!
AND GOODNESS KNOWS (GOODNESS KNOWS)
WE KNOW WHAT GOODNESS IS (OOOOHHHH)
GOODNESS KNOWS, THE WICKED DIE ALONE (SHE DIED ALONE)
WOE TO THOSE (WOE TO THOSE)
WHO SPURN WHAT GOODNESSES THEY ARE SHOWN!
NO ONE MOURNS THE WICKED (GOOD NEWS)
NO ONE MOURNS THE WICKED (GOOD NEWS)
NO ONE MOURNS... THE WICKED...
WICKED...
WICKED!!!!!
[Burr] Well, this has been fun! But as you can imagine I have much to attend to,
what with the Wizard's unexpected departure. So, if there are no further questions...
[Ozian] Glinda, is it true you were her friend?
[Ozians Gasp
[Burr] Well, I... you see... um... yes.
Louder Gasps
[Burr] Well, it depends on what you mean by "friend". She Motions Her Bubble Downward.
I did know her. That is, our paths did cross... at school. But you must understand, it was a long time ago and we were both very young.

[Students]

O, HALLOWED HALLS AND VINE DRAPED WALLS
THE PROUDLIEST SITE THERE IS.
WHEN GREY AND SEER OUR HAIR HATH TURNED,
WE SHALL STILL REVERE THE LESSONS LEARNED
IN OUR DAYS AT DEAR OLD SHIZ (DEAR OLD SHIZ)
OUR DAYS AT DEAR OLD...
[linda]

 Being Wheeled In On A Big Cart Filled With Luggage.
OOOOOOOOOOLD
All]
SHIZZZZZZZZZZZ (DEAR OLD SHIZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ)
Frex Wheels Nessarose On Stage.
[HAMILTON]
 What?! What are you looking at? Oh, do I have something in my teeth?
Okay, let's get this over with. No, I'm not seasick, yes, I've always been green, no, I didn't chew grass as a child.
[Frex]
 Elphaba!
[HAMILTON] Oh, this is my younger sister, Nessarose. As you can see, she is a perfectly normal color.
[Frex]
 Elphaba, stop making a spectacle of yourself! I'm only sending you here for one reason...
[HAMILTON] Yes, I know, to look after Nessarose.
Frex Holds Out A Box.
[Frex]
 My precious little girl] a parting gift.
[Angelica]
 Now, father... He Pulls Silver Shoes From The Box. Jeweled shoes!
[Frex]
 As befits the future governor of Munchkinland. Elphaba, take care of your sister.
And try not to talk so much! He Kisses Nessarose And Exits.
[Angelica]
 Elphaba...
[HAMILTON] Well what could he have gotten me? I clash with everything!
Mme. Morrible Enters
[Morrible]
 Welcome, new students! I am Madame Morrible, headmistress here, at Shiz University.
And whether you're here to study logic, literature, or linguification,
I know I speak for my fellow faculty members when I say we have nothing but the highest hopes for some of you.
Now, regarding room assignments... Elphaba & Galinda Raise Their Hands.
She Notices Galinda First. Yes, is this regarding room assignments?
[linda]

 Oh, Madame, thank you for asking, but I've already been assigned a private suite...
Noticing Her Followers' Disappointment. But you can all come visit me whenever you want!
Shen Shen] How good of you!
Pfanee] You are so good!
[linda]

 No I'm not!
Both] Yes you are!
[linda]

 Now stop! Swishes Her Hair.
[Morrible]
 Do you have a question?

[linda]

 Yes, you see, I am Galinda Upland of the Upperuplands... I've applied to your sorcery seminar,
and indeed that is my sole purpose of attending Shiz; to study sorcery with you.
Perhaps you recall my essay, "Magic Wands, Need They Have A Point".
[Morrible]
 Yes... However, I do not teach my seminar every semester, unless, of course, somebody special were to come along.
[linda]

 Well, exactly!
[HAMILTON] We have not yet received our room assignments.
[Morrible]
 Yes, yes, of course! Oh, You must be Miss Nessarose, the governor's daughter.
What a tragically beautiful face you have! Sees Elphaba, snorts...And you must be.
[HAMILTON] I'm the other daughter. Elphaba. I'm beautifully tragic.
[Morrible]
 Yes, yes, I'm sure you're very bright.
[linda]

 Bright? She's phosphorescent.
[Morrible]
 I don't seem to have you on my list. Oh, well a slight gulch, but not to fret! We'll find someplace to put you.
[linda]

 Y'know, I don't even think she read my essay.
Shen Shen] That's so unfair!
[Angelica]
 You should say something!
[linda]

 Should I?
Pfanee] Do it!
[Morrible]
 Now, which one of you young ladies would like to volunteer to share with Miss Elphaba?
[linda]

 Madame Morrible...
[Morrible]
 Thank you dear. Oh, how very good of you!
[linda]

 What?
[Morrible]
 Miss Elphaba, you may share with Miss Galinda.
[linda]

 Huh?
[Morrible]
 The governor made his concern for your sister's well being quite clear.
So, I thought it would be best if she share my private compartment where I can assist her as needed...
[HAMILTON] But Madame, I've always looked after my sister.
[Morrible]
 Everyone, to your dormitories.
[HAMILTON] But Madame...
[HAMILTON] Let her go!!!
Nessarose's Wheelchair Is Torn From Morrible's Hands And Begins To Wheel Itself Back To Elphaba.
[Morrible]
 How did you do that?
[linda]

 How did she do that?
[Angelica]
 Elphaba!
[Morrible]
 You mean this has happened before?
[HAMILTON] Uh... Something just comes over me sometimes... I'm sorry, Madame.
[Morrible]
 What? Never apologize for talent! Talent is a gift! Have you ever considered a career in sorcery?
[HAMILTON] Sorcery?
[Morrible]
 I shall tutor you myself, and take no other students.
[linda]

 What?
All Students But Galinda Exit.
[Morrible]
 Oh, Miss Elphaba...
MANY YEARS I HAVE WAITED
FOR A GIFT LIKE YOURS TO APPEAR
WHY I PREDICT THE WIZARD COULD MAKE YOU HIS
MAGIC, GRAND VIZIER!
MY DEAR, MY DEAR,
I'LL WRITE AT ONCE TO THE WIZARD
TELL HIM OF YOU IN ADVANCE
WITH A TALENT LIKE YOURS, DEAR, THERE IS
A DEFIN-ISH CHANCE
IF YOU WORK AS YOU SHOULD
YOU'LL BE MAKING GOOD
[linda]

 Madame Morrible...
[Morrible]
 No, not now dearest. She Exits.
[Burr] This will just make me a better person. She simles.
She Runs Off.

[HAMILTON]
DID THAT REALLY JUST HAPPEN?
HAVE I ACTUALLY UNDERSTOOD?
THIS WEIRD QUIRK I'VE TRIED TO SURPRESS OR HIDE
IS A TALENT THAT COULD HELP ME MEET THE WIZARD
IF I MAKE GOOD
SO I'LL MAKE GOOD.
WHEN I MEET THE WIZARD,
ONCE I PROVE MY WORTH,
AND THEN I MEET THE WIZARD,
WHAT I'VE WAITED FOR SINCE
SINCE BIRTH!
AND WITH ALL HIS WIZARD WISDOM
BY MY LOOKS HE WON'T BE BLINDED
DO YOU THINK THE WIZARD IS DUMB?
OR LIKE MUNCHKINS SO SMALL-MINDED? NO!
HE'LL SAY TO ME "I SEE WHO YOU TRULY ARE,
A GIRL ON WHOM I CAN RELY"
AND THAT'S HOW WE'LL BEGIN,
THE WIZARD AND I
ONCE I'M WITH THE WIZARD,
MY WHOLE LIFE WILL CHANGE,
'CUZ ONCE YOU'RE WITH THE WIZARD
NO ONE THINKS YOU'RE STRANGE
NO FATHER IS NOT PROUD OF YOU,
NO SISTER ACTS ASHAMED,
AND ALL OF OzHAS TO LOVE YOU
WHEN BY THE WIZARD YOU'RE ACLAIMED
AND THIS GIFT OR THIS CURSE
THAT I HAVE INSIDE
MAYBE AT LAST I'LL KNOW WHY
WHEN WE ARE HAND IN HAND,
THE WIZARD AND I
AND ONE DAY HE'LL SAY TO ME, "ELPHABA,
A GIRL WHO IS SO SUPERIOR,
SHOULDN'T A GIRL WHO'S SO GOOD INSIDE
HAVE A MATCHING EXTERIOR?
AND SINCE FOLKS HERE TO AN OBSURED DEGREE
SEEM FIXATED ON YOUR VERDEGRIS
WOULD IT BE ALRIGHT BY YOU
IF I DEGREENIFY YOU?"
AND OF COURSE THAT'S NOT IMPORTANT TO ME
"ALRIGHT! WHY NOT?" I'LL REPLY
OH, WHAT A PAIR WE'LL BE
THE WIZARD AND I
YES, WHAT A PAIR WE'LL BE
THE WIZARD AND...
UNLIMITED, MY FUTURE IS UNLIMITED
AND I'VE JUST HAD A VISION ALMOST LIKE A PROPHECY
I KNOW
IT SOUNDS TRULY CRAZY
AND TRUE, THE VISION'S HAZY
BUT I SWEAR SOME DAY THERE'LL BE
A CELEBRATION THROUGHOUT [Oz
THAT'S ALL TO DO
WITH ME!
AND I'LL STAND THERE WITH THE WIZARD
FEELING THINGS I'VE NEVER FELT
AND THOUGH I'D NEVER SHOW IT
I'D BE SO HAPPY I COULD MELT!
AND SO IT WILL BE FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE
AND I'LL WANT NOTHING ELSE 'TILL I DIE
HELD IN SUCH HIGH ESTEEM!
WHEN PEOPLE SEE ME THEY WILL SCREAM
FOR HALF OF [Oz'S FAVORITE TEAM]
THE WIZARD...
AND I!!!!

[linda]

 Dearest, Darlingest Momsy and Popsicle...
[HAMILTON] My dear father...
Both]
THERE'S BEEN SOME CONFUSION OVER ROOMING HERE AT SHIZ
[HAMILTON]
BUT, OF COURSE, I'LL CARE FOR NESSA...

Both]
FOR I KNOW THAT'S HOW YOU'D WANT ME TO RESPOND
Yes...
THERE'S BEEN SOME CONFUSION FOR YOU SEE MY ROOMATE IS...
[linda]


UNUSUALLY, AND EXCEEDLINGLY PECULIAR AND ALTOGETHER QUITE IMPOSSIBLE TO DESCRIBE...

[linda]


MY PULSE IS RUSHING...
[HAMILTON]
MY HEAD IS REELING...

STILL I DO BELIEVE THAT IT CAN LAST!
AND I WILL BE LOATHING, LOATHING YOU
MY WHOLE LIFE LONG!
[Students]

DEAR GALINDA, YOU ARE JUST TOO GOOD!
HOW DO YOU STAND IT, I DON'T THINK I COULD!
SHE'S A TERROR! SHE'S A TARTAR!
WE DON'T MEAN TO SHOW A BIAS,
BUT GALINDA, YOU'RE A MARTAR!
[linda]

 Well...
THESE THINGS ARE SENT TO TRY US!
[Students]

POOR GALINDA FORCED TO RESIDE

[HAMILTON] Boo!
[linda]

 Ahh!
[HAMILTON] Hahahaha!

[Hamilton]
 Settle down, now! I have read your most recent essays. And I am amazed to report the progress!
Although, some of us still tend to favor form over content... Ms. Glinda.
[linda]

 It's GAlinda.
[Hamilton]
 Excuse me... Glinda.
[linda]

 I really don't see what the problem is. Every other professor seems to be able to pronounce my name.
[HAMILTON] Maybe pronouncing your precious name isn't the sole purpose of Doctor Dillamond's life. Maybe he's not like every other professor. Maybe some of us are different.
[linda]

 Oh! It seems the artichoke is steamed.
[Hamilton]
 Class, class! Miss Elphaba has a point! As you know, I am the sole Animal on the faculty. The token Goat, as it were. But it wasn't always this way. Oh, dear students, how I wish you could have seen it as it once was. Where you could walk down the halls and see an antelope explicating a sonnet, a snow leopard solving an equation, a wildebeast waxing philosophic. Don't you see, dear students, how our dear Ozis becoming less and less...looks at Elphaba... colorful. Now, who can tell me what sent these events into motion?
[HAMILTON] Raises hand From what I've heard, it all started with the great drought.
[Hamilton]
 Exactly. Food grew scarce, people grew hungrier and angrier. And the question became "Whom can we blame?" Can anyone tell me what is meant by the term "Scapegoat"? Elphaba Raises Hand. Someone besides Miss Elphaba? Ah yes, Miss Glinda...
[linda]

 It's GAlinda... with a GA. I don't see why you can't just teach us history instead of always harping on the past.
[Hamilton]
 Well, perhaps these questions will enlighten you... Walks Over To The Chalk Board And Turns It Over. On it is written] ANIMALS SHOULD BE SEEN AND NOT HEARD. Who is responsible for this? I'm waiting for answer... Very well, that will be all for today... You heard me, class dismissed!!!
All Students Exit Except Elphaba & Nessarose. Dillamond Has His Back Turned To Her.
[HAMILTON] You go on ahead, Nessa.
Nessarose Exits.
[HAMILTON] Reading The Board Aloud. "Animals should be seen and not heard..."
[Hamilton]
 Oh, Miss Elphaba, don't worry about me, go along and enjoy your friends.
[HAMILTON] Oh that's alright, I have no friends. Would you like to share my lunch?
[Hamilton]
 Oh, thank you! How kind.
She Pulls Out A Candy Bar And Unwraps It. He Takes The Paper and Begins To Eat It. He Sees The Board.
[Hamilton]
 I seem to have lost my appetite.
[HAMILTON] You shouldn't let statements like that bother you. I mean, I always do, but you shouldn't.
[Hamilton]
if it were only a matter of words on a chalkboard. But the things one hears these days... dreadful things! Miss Elphaba...

I'VE HEARD OF AN OX, A PROFESSOR FROM QUOX
NO LONG PERMITTED TO TEACH,
WHO HAS LOST ALL POWERS OF SPEECH.
AND AN OWL IN MUNCHKIN ROCK
A VICAR WITH A THRIVING FLOCK
FORBIDDEN TO PREACH
NOW HE ONLY CAN SCREECH!
ONLY RUMORS, BUT STILL, ENOUGH TO GIVE PAUSE
TO ANYONE WITH PAWS
SOMETHING BAD IS HAPPENING IN [Oz
[HAMILTON]
SOMETHING BAD?
HAPPENING IN [Oz?
[Hamilton]

UNDER THE SURFACE
BEHIND THE SCENES
SOMETHING BAAAAAH...
Sorry, bad...
[HAMILTON] Dr. Dillamond, are you alright? Shall I fetch you a glass of water?
[Hamilton]
 No, I don't know what came over me.
[HAMILTON] So, you're saying that there are animals that have, somehow, forgotten how to speak? But, how is that possible?
[Hamilton]
 Well, with so much pressure not to...
Morrible Enters.
[Morrible]
 I heard there was some sort of disturburance in class. Are you alright, Doctor? Oh, Miss Elphaba, you're still here! I thought you would have been on your way to my seminar by now.
[HAMILTON] Yes Madame, ordinarily I would be but...
[Morrible]
 But what? I do hope I have not misplaced my trust in you. Magic is a very demanderating mistress, and if one has ambitions of meeting the Wizard. I'm sure Doctor Dillamond sees my point.
Morrible Exits.
[HAMILTON] I'd better go. Doctor Dillamond, if something bad is happening to the Animals then someone has to tell the Wizard. That's why we have a Wizard!
SO NOTHING BAD
Both]
NOTHNG ALL THAT BAD
[Hamilton]

NOTHING TRULY BAAAAHHH...
Sorry... Bad.
[HAMILTON]
IT COULDN'T HAPPEN HERE,
IN [Oz...


[BURR]
 Here we are, sir! Shiz University!
[BURR]
 What? Already?
[BURR]
 Yes, sir.
[BURR]
 What a shame. Well, we'll see you soon, Avaric. Don't worry, I won't last longer at this school than I did at any of the others.
Avaric Exits.
[Angelica]
 Uh, miss Galinda, I know I'm just a munchkin, but munchkins have feelings too, and I've been trying to tell you mine, for you. But sometimes it seems like you don't even know I'm there.
[linda]

 That's not true, Biq.
[Angelica]
 It's LAFAYETE.
[linda]

 Biq, do you know who that is? That's Fiyero Tiggular, tha Winkie Prince whose reputation is so scandalacious!
LAFAYETE Looks Disgusted. Fiyero Walks Toward Them. Galinda Swishes Her Hair. Fiyero, Noticing Her Strange Behavior, Does The Same.
[linda]

 To Fiyero. Were you looking for something or someone?
[BURR]
 Uhhh yea... history... class? I don't know... somewhere?
[Angelica]
 History building is way over there my friend...
[linda]

 That class just ended!
[BURR]
 Oh! Perfect timing! So, uh, what does one do for fun around here?
[linda]

 Nothing really... until now...
[Angelica]
 We've been studying!
[BURR]
 Well, I see that once again the responsibility to corrupt my fellow students falls to me. Fortunately, I'm up for the task.


[BURR]

THE TROUBLE WITH SCHOOLS IS
THEY ALWAYS TRY TO TEACH THE WRONG LESSON
BELIEVE ME, I'VE BEEN KICKED OUT OF ENOUGH OF THEM TO KNOW!
THEY WANT YOU TO BECOME LESS CALLOW, LESS SHALLOW,
BUT I SAY WHY INVITE STRESS IN?
STOP STUDYING STRIFE
AND LEARN TO LIVE
THE UNEXAMINED LIFE...
DANCIN' THROUGH LIFE
SKIMMING THE SURFACE
GLIDING WHERE TURF IS SMOOTH
LIFE IS PAINLESS FOR THE BRAINLESS
THOSE WHO DON'T TRY, NEVER LOOK FOOLISH
DANCING THROUGH LIFE
NO NEED TO TOUGH IT
WHEN YOU CAN SLUFF IT OFF AS I DO
NOTHING MATTERS, BUT KNOWING NOTHING MATTERS
IT'S JUST LIFE, SO KEEP DANCING THROUGH
DANCING THROUGH LIFE
SWAYING AND SWEEPING
AND ALWAYS KEEPING COOL
LIFE IS FRAUGHTLESS
WHEN YOU'RE THOUGHTLESS
THOSE WHO DON'T TRY
NEVER LOOK FOOLISH
DANCING THROUGH LIFE
MINDLESS AND CARELESS
MAKE SURE YOU'RE WHERE LESS TROUBLE IS RIFE
WHOES ARE FLEETING
BLOWS ARE GLANCING
WHEN YOU'RE DANCING
THROUGH LIFE!
So! What's the most swankified place in town?
[linda]

 That would be the

Sounds perfect!
LET'S GO DOWN TO THE [OzDUST BALLROOM
WE'LL MEET THERE LATER TONIGHT
WE CAN DANCE 'TIL IT'S LIGHT
FIND THE PRETTIEST GIRL
GIVE HER A WHIRL!
RIGHT ON DOWN TO THE [OzDUST BALLROOM
COME ON FOLLOW ME!
YOU'LL BE HAPPY TO BE THERE
[Students]

DANCIN' THROUGH LIFE, DOWN AT THE [OzDUST (LIFE!)
[BURR]

IF ONLY BECAUSE DUST IS WHAT WE COME TO!
[Students]

NOTHIN' MATTERS, BUT KNOWING NOTHING MATTERS
IT'S JUST LIFE!!!
[BURR]

SO KEEP DANCING THROUGH...
[Angelica]
 Miss Galinda? I hope you'll save at least one dance for me. I'll be waiting right there, right by your side, waiting, all night.
[linda]

 Oh, how very kind, Biq.
[Angelica]
 ... LAFAYETE...
[linda]

 But, do you know what would be even kinder?
SEE THAT TRAGICALLY BEAUTIFUL GIRL?
THE ONE IN THE CHAIR?
IT SEEMS SO UNFAIR
WE SHOULD GO ON A SPREE
AND NOT SHE, GEE
I KNOW SOMEONE WOULD BE MY HERO
IF THAT SOMEONE WERE
TO GO INVITE HER!
[Angelica]
 Well, maybe I could invite her!
[linda]


OH, BIQ, REALLY?
YOU WOULD DO THAT FOR ME?
[Angelica]
 I would do anything for you, Miss Galinda. Walks Over To Nessarose.
Excuse me, Miss Nessarose? There's something I'd like to ask you...
[BURR]
 To Galinda. You're good.
[linda]

 I don't know what you mean. But I do happen to be free tonight, so...
[BURR]
 So, I'll be picking you up around eight?
[linda]

 After all...
NOW THAT WE'VE MET ONE ANOTHER,
Both]
IT'S CLEAR WE DESERVE EACHOTHER!
[linda]

 You're perfect!
[BURR]
 You're perfect!
[CAST]
SO WE'RE PERFECT TOGETHER
BORN TO BE FOREVER
DANCING THROUGH LIFE!!!
[HAMILTON] It's absurd! This silly, rich boy appears and everyone's off to worship him and some cultish social gathering!
[Angelica]
 Even me! I'm going! Isn't it wonderful? LAFAYETE was too shy to ask me at first, but once Galinda encouraged him...
[HAMILTON] Galinda?!
[Angelica]
 Don't you dare say another word against her! I'm about to have the first happy night of my life all thanks to Galinda!
FINALLY FOR THIS ONE NIGHT,
I'M ABOUT TO HAVE A FUN NIGHT
WITH THIS MUNCHKIN BOY GALINDA FOUND FOR ME
AND I ONLY WISH THERE WERE
SOMETHING I COULD DO FOR HER TO REPAY HER
ELPHABA SEE...
WE DESERVE EACHOTHER AND GALINDA HELPED IT COME TRUE
WE DESERVE EACHOTHER, ME AND LAFAYETE
Please, Elphaba, try to understand.
[HAMILTON] I do...
[linda]

 Now I must accessorize myself for Fiyero.
Shen Shen Pulls The Witch's Hat Out Of One Of Galinda's Hat Boxes.
Pfanee] Galinda, what in [Oz's name!?
[linda]

 Now, just pretend you didn't see that. My granny is always giving me the most hideodeous hats.
I'd give it away, but I don't hate anyone that much.
Shen Shen] Yes you do!
Pfanee] Give it to her! Just do it!
They All Stare At Elphaba. Galinda Walks Forward, Meeting Elphaba Half Way.
[HAMILTON] Galinda, listen, Nessa and I were talking about you just now...
[linda]

 And I was just talking about you! I thought you might want to wear this hat to the party tonight! Gives Her The Hat.
IT'S REALLY... UH... SHARP!
DON'T YOU THINK?
Y'KNOW BLACK, IS THIS YEAR'S PINK!
YOU DESERVE EACHOTHER,
THIS HAT AND YOU,
YOU'RE BOTH SO... SMART!
YOU DESERVE EACHOTHER, SO HERE!
OUT OF THE GOODNESS OF MY HEART!
Galinda Runs Off. Elphaba Laughs At The Sight Of The Hat. She Exits.. The Students Enter And Dance.
When This Is Done, LAFAYETE And Nessarose Appear, Awkwardly Holding Hands.
[Angelica]
 What's in the punch?
[Angelica]
 Lemons, and melons, and pears!
[Angelica]
 Oh my!
[Angelica]

LISTEN NESSA...
[Angelica]
 Yes?
[Angelica]

UH, NESSA...
I'VE GOT SOMETHING TO CONFESS A
REASON WHY, WELL, WHY I ASKED YOU HERE TONIGHT...
NOW, I KNOW IT ISN'T FAIR.
[Angelica]
 Oh, LAFAYETE, I know why.
[Angelica]
 You do?
[Angelica]

IT'S BECAUSE I'M IN THIS CHAIR, AND YOU FELT SORRY FOR ME...
WELL, ISN'T THAT RIGHT?
[Angelica]
 No... it's because... uh... because...
BECAUSE YOU ARE SO BEAUTIFUL!
[Angelica]
 Oh, LAFAYETE!
I THINK YOU'RE WONDERFUL!
AND WE DESERVE EACH OTHER, DON'T YOU SEE THIS IS OUR CHANCE?
WE DESERVE EACH OTHER, DON'T WE LAFAYETE?
[Angelica]
 You know what? Let's dance!
[Angelica]
 What?
[Angelica]

LET'S DANCE!
They Dance, As Well As The Others Around Them. Finally, Mme. Morrible Runs Up To Galinda.
[Morrible]
 Oh, Miss Upland?
[linda]

 Madame Morrible... What are you doing here?
[Morrible]
 I have something for you. She Hands Her A Small Wand.
[linda]

 Gasps. Madame... a training wand... How can I ever express my graditution?
[Morrible]
 Oh, don't thank me! This was your roommate's idea, not mine.
[linda]

 What? Elphaba?
[Morrible]
 Miss Elphaba requested that I include you in sorcery class. She insisted I tell you this very night or she would quit the seminar.
[linda]

 But... why?
[Morrible]
 I have no idea. My personal opinion is you do not have what it takes. I hope you'll prove me wrong... I doubt you will.
She Leaves. Fiyero Comes Up To Galinda.
[BURR]
 What is it?
[linda]

 I got what I wanted...
[BURR]
 Then what's the matter?
[linda]

 Nothing...
[BURR]
 Good. Let's dance...
They Begin To Dance As Elphaba Walks In. They Stop As All The Students Gasp And Make Comments About The Way She Is Dressed. People Then Start Laughing.
[BURR]
 Who in Ozis this?
[linda]

 My roommate... please, don't ... stare!
[BURR]
 How can you help it?
Elphaba Takes Off The Hat, Noticing The Comments. She Waits, Then Puts It Back On And Begins To Dance. She Is Alone. There Is No Music.
[BURR]
 Well I'll say this, she doesn't give a twig about what anyone else thinks.
[linda]

 Of course does, she just pretends not to... I feel awful...
[BURR]
 Why? It's not like it's your fault.
[linda]

 Excuse me... She Walks Over To Elphaba and Clears Her Throat. May I cut in?
Galinda Begins Dancing Just As Horribly. The Students Now Accept It, And Begin To Dance Again As The Music Starts.

[Scene 9 - Sharing Secrets]
Elphaba & Galinda Barge Into Their Suite... Galinda Is In Hysterics.
[linda]

 Your very first party ever?! Your very first party! Oh I know! Let's tell each other something we've never told anyone... I'll go first] Fiyero and I are going to be married (squeals).
[HAMILTON] Really? He's asked you already?
[linda]

 No, he doesn't know yet... Now, you tell me a secret.
[HAMILTON] Like what?
[linda]

 Like... Why do you always sleep with this funny, little, green bottle under your pillow? Grabs The Bottle.
[HAMILTON] Give that back.
[linda]

 C'mon, tell me. Tell me tell me!
[HAMILTON] It was my mother's! That's all...
Silence.
[linda]

 Hands Her The Bottle. It's not fair. I told you a really good one.
[HAMILTON] My father hates me.
[linda]

 Gasps.
[HAMILTON] No, that's not the secret. It's my fault...
[linda]

 What is?
[HAMILTON] ... that my sister is the way she is. . Pause. You see, when my mother was carrying Nessa, my father was worried that the new baby might come out...
Both] Green.
[HAMILTON] So he made my mother chew milk flowers, day and night. But that made Nessa come too soon, with her little legs all tangled. And my mother never woke up. None of which ever would have happened if not for me.
[linda]

 But that was the milkflowers fault, not yours. That may be your secret, Elphaba, but that doesn't make it true. She Oh look, it's tomorrow! Elphie... do you mind if I call you Elphie?
[HAMILTON] Well, it's a little perky.
[linda]

 And you can call me... Galinda. So... Elphie... now that we're friends, I've decided to make you my new project!
[HAMILTON] You really don't have to do that.
[linda]

 I know, that's what makes me so nice!

[linda]

 Oh Elphie, you mustn't think that way anymore! Your whole life is going to change... and all because of me. Okay, stand... I will turn your frock into a beautiful ball gown! Stand up... She Picks Up Her Wand And Waves It. Ball gown!!! Nothing Happens, So She Repeats. Ball gown!!! Still Nothing Happens. She Taps Her Wand On The Bed. Is this thing on?
[HAMILTON] Do you want me to try?
[linda]

 No, I've got it! She Throws The Wand Down. Oh, just wear the frock... it's pretty! Now,
I'll show you how to flip your hair] Flip flip. Or you could use your hand. Demonstrates.
Or, you can use your whole body. Falls onto bed. Squeals. Now, for the finishing touch.
Takes flower out of her hair, puts it into Elphaba's. Why, Miss Elphaba, look at you, you're beautiful. Hands her the mirror.
[HAMILTON] After Looking In The Mirror. I... I have to go.
She Runs Off.

[HAMILTON] Flips her hair.. Flip Flip! What?
[BURR]
 Nothing, it's just... you've been "Galinda-fied". You don't have to do that , you know?
[Hamilton]
 Alright, take your seats, class! I have something to say, and very little time to say it. This is my last day here at Shiz I am no longer permitted to teach. I want to thank you for your sharing your enthusiasm, your essays, no matter how feebly structured, and even, on occasion, your lunch.
Mme. Morrible Rushes In.
[Morrible]
 Doctor Dillamond! I'm so dreadfully sorry.
[HAMILTON] Madame, we've got to do something.
[Hamilton]
 Miss Elphaba, they can take away my job, but I shall continue speaking out.
Scientist] Come on, goat...
To Men Begin To Carry Him Out Of The Room.
[Hamilton]
 They are not telling you the whole story! Remember that, class! Remember that.
He Is Gone.
[HAMILTON] Doctor Dillamond! After A Pause. Well, are you just going to sit here in silence?
[Morrible]
 Miss Elphaba, there is nothing we can do. Please take your seat.
Professor] Good afternoon, students!
[Morrible]
 Good afternoon.
Professor] Every day, with every tick of the Time Dragon Clock, in every corner of our great [Oz, one hears the silence of progress. For example] this is called a cage!
He Points To A Cage With A Cloth Draped Over It. He Pulls Off The Cloth, Revealing A Lion Cub Inside.
Professor] Now, we will be seeing more and more of them in the near future. This remarkable innovation is actually for the Animal's own good...
[HAMILTON] If this is for his own good, then why is he trembling?
Professor] He's just excited to be here, that's all. Hits the cage. Now, as I was saying, one of the benefits of caging a Lion cub while he's young is that he never, in fact, will learn how to speak.
[HAMILTON] What?
He Motions The Students Forward, Toward The Cage.
Professor] That's right! Come closer!
[HAMILTON] To Fiyero. Can you imagine a world where Animals are kept in cages and they never speak?
Professor] Now, he may seem a bit agitated but that's easily remedied.
[HAMILTON] What should I do?
[BURR]
 I don't know.
[HAMILTON] Well, somebody has to... Do something!!!
Sparks Begin To Fly Everywhere. All Students & The Professor Are Moving Uncontrollably Except Fiyero and Elphaba.
[BURR]
 What's happening?
[HAMILTON] I don't know I got mad...andd
[BURR]
 Alright just don't move! And don't get mad at me... He Grabs The Cage. Well are you coming?
She Runs With Him After He Snatches The Lion Cub.
[HAMILTON] Careful! Don't shake him!
[BURR]
 I'm not!
[HAMILTON] We can't just let him loose anywhere, you know. We have to find someplace safe...
[BURR]
 Don't you think that I realize that? You must think I'm really stupid or something!
[HAMILTON] No, not really stupid.
[BURR]
 Why is it that every time I see you you're causing some sort of commotion?
[HAMILTON] I don't cause commotions, I am one.
[BURR]
 That's for sure.
[HAMILTON] Oh! So you think I should just keep my mouth shut! Is that what you're saying?
[BURR]
 No, I'm...
[HAMILTON] Do you think I want to be this way? Do you think I want to care this much? Don't you know how much easier my life would be if I didn't?
[BURR]
 Do you ever let anyone else talk?
[HAMILTON] Oh, sorry... But can I just say one more thing? You could have just walked away back there.
[BURR]
 So?
[HAMILTON] So, no matter how shallow and self-absorbed you tend to be...
[BURR]
 Excuse me, there's no pretense here. I happen to be genuinely self-absorbed and deeply shallow.
[HAMILTON] No you're not. Or you wouldn't be so unhappy.
[BURR]
 Fine, if you don't want my help...
[HAMILTON] No, I do! Poor little thing, it's heart is trembling... I didn't mean for...
[BURR]
 What did you mean to do? Why was I the only one you didn't do it to?
[HAMILTON] Oh look, you're bleeding... it must have scratched you. Referring To A Cut On His Face.
[BURR]
 Yea... or maybe it scratched me. I better get to safety... I mean the cub... get the cub to safety. He Walks Off.
[HAMILTON] Fiyero...

[[HAMILTON]
Miss Elphaba, there you are!
[HAMILTON] Madame Morrible...
[Morrible]
 Oh Miss Elphaba, I finally heard back from the Wizard!
[HAMILTON] The Wizard?
[Morrible]
 Yes, he wishes to meet you!
[HAMILTON] He asked for me?
[Morrible]
 Yes! I know how devastated you were the other day for our poor Doctor Dillamond, but I can assure you my dear, as one door closes, another one opens. She Hands Her A Green Envelope.
[HAMILTON] Madame, I don't know what to say! How can I ever thank you? She Hugs Her.
[Morrible]
 Oh careful dear, you musn't get wet She Places The Umbrella Back Over Elphaba's Head. Oh, I know! She Waves Her Hands And The Sun Comes Out. Didn't I tell you? Weather is my specialty. [Oz-speed, my dear! Make me proud.
[HAMILTON] I will, I'll try.
Morrible Exits.

[HAMILTON]
AND THERE WE'LL FINALLY BE
THE WIZARD AND I...

Conductor] All aboard!
[linda]

 Remember, eye contact. And don't forget to tell him how wonderful he is, Wizards love that! And be yourself... well... within reason.
LAFAYETE Wheels Nessarose Onstage.
[Angelica]
 Elphaba, I'm so proud of you and I know father would be too. We're all proud, aren't we?
[HAMILTON] You'll be alright, won't you?
[linda]

 She'll be fine! Biq will take care of her, right?
[Angelica]
 ...It's LAFAYETE... I... I can't do this anymore.
He Exits.
[Angelica]
 LAFAYETE...
[linda]

 Nessa, maybe he's just not the right one... for you.
[Angelica]
 No, it's me that's not right. Elphaba, just go, I'll be fine.
She Wheels Herself Offstage.
[HAMILTON] Nessa, wait!
[linda]

 Let her go. She'll have to manage without you. We all will.
[HAMILTON] Please, you'll barely even notice I'm gone. Besides, you have Fiyero. Where is he, anyway? Not that I expected him to say goodbye to me. We barely know each other.
[linda]

 I don't know him either. He's distant, and moodified, and he's been thinking, which really worrries me. I never knew how much he card about that old goat.
Fiyero Enters.
[linda]

 Oh, there he is! Fiyero, over here dearest!
[BURR]
 He Hands Elphaba Flowers. Elphaba, I'm happy for you.
[linda]

 Yes, we are both so happy...
[BURR]
 Uh, listen, I've been thinking...
[HAMILTON] Yes, I've heard.
[BURR]
 About that Lion cub and... everything. I think about that day a lot.
[HAMILTON] Really? So do I.
[linda]

 Me too! Poor Doctor Dillamond. It makes one want to... uh...
take a stand. So I've been thinking of... uh... changing my name.
[BURR]
 Your name?
[linda]

 Well, yes! Since Doctor Dillamond had his own way of pronouncing my name,
in solidarity and to express my outrage, I will henceforward be known no longer as Galinda, but as simply, Glinda.
[BURR]
 Oh well, that's very admirable of you... Glinda. To Elphaba. Elphaba, good luck.
He Runs Off.
[Burr] There, see?
[HAMILTON] Galinda...
[Burr] It's Glinda now. Stupid idea, I don't even know what made me say it.
[HAMILTON] It doesn't matter what your name is, everyone loves you!
[Burr] I don't care! I want him. I don't even think he's perfect anymore and I still want him.
This must be what other people feel like. How do they bear it? They embrace.

[HAMILTON] Come with me.
[Burr] Where?
[HAMILTON] To the Emerald City.
[Burr] Really?
[Ozia]

ONE SHORT DAY, IN THE EMERALD CITY...

[Burr] Say something!
[HAMILTON] Uh... Elphaba Thropp your terribleness!
His Speaks Normally.
[Hamilton]
Oh? Is that you Elphaba? I didn't realize!
He Climbs Out Of The Head.
[Hamilton]
I hope I didn't startle you, it's so hard to make out peoples' faces all the way back there.
So, let's see... which is which? Elphaba! He grabs her hands. And you must be.
[Burr] Glinda. The Ga is silent.
Elphaba touches the Ozmask.
[Hamilton]
I know. It isn't much, is it? But people expect this sort of thing. You have to give people what they want.
The thing is, I hardly ever let people meet the real me, but this being special occasion.
[HAMILTON] I'm so happy to meet you.
[Hamilton]
Well, that's good. 'Cause that's what I love best] making people happy!
I AM A SENTIMENTAL MAN
WHO ALWAYS LONGED TO BE A FATHER
THAT'S WHY I DO THE BEST I CAN
TO TREAT EACH CITIZEN OF OzAS SON
OR DAUGHTER
SO ELPHABA I'D LIKE TO RAISE YOU HIGH
'CUZ I THINK EVERYONE DESERVES THE CHANCE TO FLY!
AND HELPING YOU WITH YOUR ASCENT
ALLOWS ME TO FEEL SO PARENTAL.
FOR I AM
A SENTIMENTAL MAN!
[HAMILTON] I'm here... we're here to alert you that something bad is happening...
[Hamilton]
Please, I'm the Wizard of [Oz. I already know why you've come.
Elphaba & [Burr] Oooo.
[Hamilton]
Of course, you must prove yourself...
[Burr] Prove yourself, prove yourself.
[HAMILTON] But how?
[Hamilton]
Oh, I don't know.
SOME SORT OF GESTURE
MOSTLY FOR SHOW
SOMETHING TO TEST YOUR ADEPTNESS..
I know! Madame, the book!
Morrible Enters.
[Burr] Madame Morrible...
[Hamilton]
I believe you're well acquainted with my new Press Secretary.
[HAMILTON] Press Secretary?
[Morrible]
 Oh, yes dearies, I've risen up in the world. You'll find that the Wizard is a very generous man.
If you do something for him, he'll do much for you.
[HAMILTON] What do yhou want me to do?
[Hamilton]
Well, this is my monkey servent, Chistery. He looks so longingly at the birds every morning....
[Morrible]
 So the Wizard was thinking, perhaps, a levitation spell...
[Burr] Noticing A Book In Morrible's Hands. Is that the Grimmerie?
[Morrible]
 Yes, the ancient book of spells and enchantments. Hands It To Elphaba.
[Burr] Whispers. Can I touch it?
Morrlbe] Whispers. No!
[HAMILTON] What funny writing...
[Morrible]
 Well it's a lost language. The lost language of spells.
[Hamilton]
It's kind of a recipe book for change.
[Morrible]
 Don't be discouraged if you can't decipherate it, dearie.
I, myself, can only read a spell or two, and that took years and years
[HAMILTON]
AHVEN, TATEY, AVEN TATEY AVEN...
[Hamilton]
She Continues Chanting. Oh, Chistery, what a experience you are about to have!
[HAMILTON] .................................. AH MAY AH TAY ATUM
[Hamilton]
SINCE ONCE I HAVE MY OWN DAY IN THE SKY...
[HAMILTON] AH MAY AH TAH TAY MAY TU SE SAY TA!
[Hamilton]
I KNOW EVERYONE DESERVES THE CHANCE TO FLY!
Chistery Screams & Begins To Twitch.
[HAMILTON] What happened? Is something wrong?
[Morrible]
 No just a transition, dearie.
[HAMILTON] No, stop you're hurting him!
[Hamilton]
She's actually done it!
Chistery Sprouts Wings. And Begins Running Around The Stage.
[HAMILTON] NO! Quick, how do I reverse it?
[Morrible]
 You can't!
[HAMILTON] What?!
[Morrible]
 You can't! Spells are irreversible! I knew she had the power, I told you!
[HAMILTON] You planned all this?
[Morrible]
 Well, you benefit too, dearie! You benefit, too.
[Hamilton]
And this is only the beginning! Look.
The Other Monkeys Begin To Grow Wings And Fly.
[Morrible]
 Won't they make perfect spies?
[HAMILTON] Spies?!
[Hamilton]
You're right, that's a harsh word... how about scouts? That's what they'll be really. They'll fly around [Oz! Report any subversive Animal activity.
[HAMILTON] You can't read this book at all! Can you? That's why you need enemies, and cages, and spies. You have no real power.
[Hamilton]
Exactly... that's why I need you. Don't you see? The world is your oyster, now! You have so many...opportunites. You both do.
[Burr] Thank you, your [Ozness.
Wizard]
SINCE ONCE I HAD MY OWN DAY IN THE SKY
I KNOW EVERYONE DESERVES THE CHANCE TO...
[HAMILTON] NO!
She Runs Off.
[Morrible]
 Elphaba!
[Burr] Elphie! I am so sorry, your Wizardship. I'll fetch her back! Elphie wait!
She Runs After Her.
[Hamilton]
We must get her back. She knows too much.
[Morrible]
 Don't worry! I will handle it.
He Gets Back In The Head. Speaking, Again, With A Powerful Voice.
[Hamilton]
Guards, guards! There is a fugitive loose in the palace! Find her, capture her, and bring her to me!
Guards] Yes your [Ozness!

[Burr] Elphie, wait! Where are you going?
[HAMILTON] Oh no! There are no more stairs! This might be the attic...
[Burr] Elphaba, listen to me...
[HAMILTON] I have to barricade the door! She Picks Up A Broom And Places It Over A Trap Door.
[Burr] Elphaba, why couldn't you have stayed calm for once instead of flying off the handle?
I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY
I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY NOW
I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY HOW YOU'VE HURT YOUR CAUSE FOREVER
I HOPE YOU THINK YOU'RE CLEVER
[HAMILTON]
I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY! I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY TOO
I HOPE YOU'RE PROUD HOW YOU WOULD GROVEL IN SUBMISSION
TO FEED YOUR OWN AMBISSION
Both]
SO THOUGH I CAN'T IMAGINE HOW
I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY
RIGHT NOW...
[Morrible]
 Citizens of [Oz, there is an enemy that must be found and captured! Believe nothing she says. She's evil. Responsible for the mutilation of these poor, innocent monkeys! Her green skin is but an outward manifestation of her twisted nature! This distortion... this repulsion... this... Wicked Witch!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[Burr] Don't be afraid...
[HAMILTON] I'm not... it's the Wizard who should be afraid... of me!
[Burr] Elphie, just say you're sorry before it's too late.
YOU CAN STILL BE WITH THE WIZARD
WHAT YOU'VE WORKED AND WAITED FOR
YOU CAN HAVE ALL YOU EVER WANTED...
[HAMILTON] I know...
BUT I DON'T WANT IT
NO, I CAN'T WANT IT
ANYMORE...
SOMETHING HAS CHANGED WITHIN ME
SOMETHING IS NOT THE SAME
I'M THROUGH WITH PLAYING BY THE RULES
OF SOMEONE ELSE'S GAME!
TOO LATE FOR SECOND GUESSING
TOO LATE TO GO BACK TO SLEEP
IT'S TIME TO TRUST MY INSTINCTS
CLOSE MY EYES...
AND LEAP
IT'S TIME TO TRY DEFYING GRAVITY
I THINK I'LL TRY DEFYING GRAVITY
AND YOU CAN'T PULL ME DOWN
[Burr]
CAN'T I MAKE YOU UNDERSTAND
YOU'RE HAVING DELUSIONS OF GRANDURE?
[HAMILTON]
I'M THROUHG EXCEPTING LIMITS
'CUZ SOMEONE SAYS THEY'RE SO
SOME THINGS I CANNOT CHANGE,
BUT 'TIL I TRY I'LL NEVER KNOW!
TOO LONG I'VE BEEN AFRAID OF
LOSING LOVE I GUESS I'D LOST
WELL IF THAT'S LOVE,
IT COMES AT MUCH TOO HIGH A COST!
I'D SOONER BUY DEFYING GRAVITY
KISS ME GOODBYE I'M DEFYING GRAVITY
AND YOU CAN'T PULL ME DOWN!
The Guards Bang On The Locked Door.
[Guard]
 Open this door, in the name of his supreme [Ozness!
[HAMILTON] Ah May Ah Tay Ah Tum Ditum...
[Burr]
That's what started all this in the first place... that hideous levitation spell! STOP!!!
[Burr] Well... Where are your wings? Maybe you're not as powerful as you think you are...
A Broomstick Floats Across The Room Towards Elphaba.
[HAMILTON] I told you, Glinda... I did it, I tell ya!
The Guards Bang On The Door Once Again.
[HAMILTON] Quick! Get on!
[Burr] What?

She Drapes A Black Cape Around Her.
I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY
NOW THAT YOU'RE CHOOSING THIS
[HAMILTON] You too.
I HOPE IT BRINGS YOU BLISS
Both]
I REALLY HOPE YOU GET IT
AND YOU DON'T LIVE TO REGRET IT
I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY IN THE END!
I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY...
MY FRIEND...
Elphaba Runs Off. The Guards Break Down The Door.
[Guard]
 There she is! Don't let her get away!
They Grab Hold Of Glinda.
[Burr]
What in [Oz?! Let go of me! Do you hear me? Let go!
[HAMILTON]
It's not her. She has nothing to do with. I'm the one you want. It's me. Hahahahaha. It's me! Up here! It's me!
She Rises Up Center Stage Holding Her Broom.
[HAMILTON]
SO IF YOU CARE TO FIND ME,
LOOK TO THE WESTERN SKY

OH WHAT A CELEBRATION WE'LL HAVE TODAY!
[Ozia]

THANK GOODNESS!
[Burr]
LET'S HAVE A CELEBRATION THE GLINDA WAY!
[Ozia]

THANK GOODNESS!
[Morrible]

FINALLY A DAY THAT'S TOTALLY WICKED WITCH FREE
All]
WE COULDN'T BE HAPPIER
THANK GOODNESS!
[Morrible]
 And thank goodness for you, Glinda, and your handsome swain, our new captain of the guard.
To Fiyero. Now you've been at the forefront of the hunt for the Wicked Witch, haven't you?
[BURR]
 Not really, but I don't like to think of her as a Wicked Witch.
[Morrible]
 Captain, how does it feel?
[BURR]
 Frustrating... but I became captain of the guard to find her, and I will keep searching!
[Morrible]
 No, being engaged!
[Ozia]
 Congratulotions!
[BURR]
 To Glinda - Confused. This is an engagement party?
[Burr] Surprised?
[BURR]
 Yes!
[Burr] Good, we hoped you'd be... the Wizard and I!
WE COULDN'T BE HAPPIER
RIGHT DEAR?
COULDN'T BE HAPPIER
RIGHT HERE
LOOK WHAT WE'VE GOT
A FAIRY TALE PLOT
OUR VERY OWN HAPPY ENDING
WHERE WE COULDN'T BE HAPPIER
TRUE DEAR?
COULDN'T BE HAPPIER
AND WE'RE HAPPY TO SHARE OUR ENDING VICARIOUSLY
WITH ALL OF YOU!
HE COULDN'T LOOK HANDSOMER
I COULDN'T BE HUMBLER
BECAUSE HAPPY IS WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN ALL YOUR DREAMS COME TRUE...
[Morrible]
 And Glinda, dear, we're happy for you! As Press Secretary,
I have striven to ensure that all of Ozknows the story of your braverism! How I vividly remember...
THE DAY YOU WERE FIRST SUMMONED
TO AN AUDIENCE WITH [Oz,
AND ALTHOUGH HE WOULD NOT TELL YOU WHY INITIALLY
WHEN YOU BOWED BEFORE HIS THROWN
HE DECREED YOU'D HENCE BE KNOWN
AS GLINDA THE GOOD
OFFICIALLY!
[BURR]
 That's not how you described it to me.
[Burr] Oh no, not exactly, but Whispers we'll talk about it later.
[Morrible]

THEN WITH A JEALOUS SQUEEE
THE WICKED WITCH BURST FROM CONCEALMENT
WHERE SHE HAD BEEN LURKING
SURREPTITIALLY!
Gasps From Among The Crowd.
[Ozian]
I HEAR SHE HAS AN EXTRA EYE THAT ALWAYS REMAINS AWAKE!
[Ozian]
I HEAR THAT SHE CAN SHED HER SKIN AS EASILY AS A SNAKE!
[Ozian]
I HEAR SOME REBEL ANIMALS ARE GIVING HER FOOD AND SHELTER!
[Ozian]
I HEAR HER SOUL IS SO UNCLEAN, PURE WATER CAN MELT HER!
[BURR]
 What?
[Ozia]

MELT HER! PLEASE SOMEBODY GO AND MELT HER!
[BURR]
 Do you hear that?! Water will melt her? People are so empty-headed they'll believe anything!
[Burr] Excuse me just a tick-tock!
Her And Fiyero Talk Aside.
[BURR]
 I can't just stand here grinning pretending to go along with all of this!
[Burr] Do you think I like to hear them say those awful things about her? I hate it!
[BURR]
 Then what are we doing here? Let's go, let's get out of here!
[Burr] We can't leave now, not when people are looking to us to raise their spirits.
[BURR]
 You can't leave, because you can't resist this. And that is the truth.
[Burr] Maybe I can't. Is that so wrong? Who could?
[BURR]
 You know who could. Who has.
[Burr] Fiyero, I miss her too, but we can't just stop living. No one has searched harder for her than you. But don't you see? She doesn't want to be found. We have to face it.
[BURR]
 You're right. I'm sorry, you're right. And if it's going tol make you happy, of course I'll marry you.
[Burr] But it'll make you happy too, right?
[BURR]
 You know me... I'm always happy. He Runs Off.
[Burr] Fiyero! Thanks plenty dearest! He's gone to fetch me a refreshment, he's so thoughtful that way!
THAT'S WHY I COULDN'T BE HAPPIER
NO, I COULDN'T BE HAPPIER
THOUGH IT IS I ADMIT, THE TINIEST BIT
UNLIKE I ANTICIPATED,
BUT I COULDN'T BE HAPPIER
SIMPLY COULDN'T BE HAPPIER...
Well, not simply...
'CUZ GETTING YOUR DREAMS, IT'S STRANGE BUT IT SEEMS
A LITTLE, WELL, COMPLICATED...
THERE'S A KIND OF A SORT OF COST
THERE'S A COUPLE OF THINGS GET LOST...
THERE ARE BRIDGES YOU CROSSED YOU DIDN'T KNOW YOU CROSSED UNTIL YOU'VE CROSSED!
AND IF THAT JOY THAT THRILL
DOESN'T THRILL LIKE YOU THINK IT WILL...
STILL... WITH THIS PERFECT FINALE
THE CHEERS AND THE BALLYHOO
WHO WOULDN'T BE HAPPIER?
SO I COULDN'T BE HAPPIER
BECAUSE HAPPY IS WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN ALL YOUR DREAMS COME TRUE...
WELL, ISN'T IT?
HAPPY IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOUR DREAMS COME...
TRUE!!!!
[Ozia]

WE LOVE YOU GLINDA IF WE MAY BE SO FRANK!
[Burr]
THANK GOODNESS!
[Ozia]

FOR ALL THIS JOY WE KNOW WHO WE'VE GOT TO THANK!
THANK GOODNESS!

[Burr] TODAY!!!!
[Ozia]

[Angelica]
 Will there be anything else, Madame?
[Angelica]
 I've asked you to call me Nessarose, remember?
[Angelica]
 Yes, Madame. He Exits.
[Angelica]
 LAFAYETE...
Elphaba's Voice Is Heard Inside A Closet.
[HAMILTON] Well, it seems the beautiful only get more beautiful, Nessarose Screams while the green just get greener.
Nessarose Is Scared And Confused.
Elphaba Steps Out Of The Closet.
[HAMILTON] I'm sorry. Did I scare you? I seem to have that effect on people. It's good to see you.
[Angelica]
 What are you doing here?
[HAMILTON] Well, there's no place like home. I never thought I'd hear myself say this but I need father's help. I need him to stand with me.
[Angelica]
 That's impossible.
[HAMILTON] No, no it's not. Not if you ask him. You know he'll listen to you.
[Angelica]
 Father's dead.
[HAMILTON] What?
[Angelica]
 He's dead. I'm the governor... Well what did you expect? After he learned what you'd done,
how you'd disgraced u,s he died... of shame. Embarrassed to death.
[HAMILTON] Good, I'm glad. It's better that way.
[Angelica]
 That's a wicked thing to say.
[HAMILTON] No, it's true. Because now it's just us. You can help me and together we can...
[Angelica]
 Elphaba, shut up! First of all, I can't harbor a fugitive, I'm an un-elected official!
And why should I help you? You fly around [Oz, trying to rescue animals you've never even met,
and not once have you ever thought to use your powers to rescue me!
ALL OF MY LIFE, I'VE DEPENDED ON YOU
HOW DO YOU THINK THAT FEELS?
ALL OF MY LIFE I'VE DEPENDED ON YOU
AND THIS HIDEOUS CHAIR WITH WHEELS!
SCROUNGING FOR SCRAPS OF PITY TO PICK UP
AND LONGING TO KICK UP
MY HEELS...
[HAMILTON] Nessa, there isn't a spell for everything! The power is mysterious.
It's not like coddling up a pair of... She Pulls Out The Grimmerie From Her Bag. Wait.
[Angelica]
 What are you doing?
Elphaba Begins Chanting.
[Angelica]
 What is that? Ah! My shoes! It feels like... like they're on fire! What have you done to my shoes???
She Lifts Her Dress, Revealing The Ruby Slippers. Nessarose Stands, But Falls. Elphaba Gives Her A Hand.
[Angelica]
 No, don't help me. She Stands.
[HAMILTON] Oh, Nessa, at last...
I'VE DONE WHAT LONG AGO I SHOULD
AND FINALLY FROM THESE POWERS SOMETHING GOOD
FINALLY SOMETHING GOOD...
[Angelica]
 LAFAYETE! LAFAYETE! Come quickly!
[HAMILTON] LAFAYETE?
[Angelica]
 LAFAYETE! Come here at once!
[HAMILTON] No! Nessa, listen, nobody can know I'm here!
Nessarose Runs Behind The Closet As LAFAYETE Enters.
[Angelica]
 Yes, what is it, Madame?
[HAMILTON] LAFAYETE...
[Angelica]
 What are you doing here? You stay back!
[HAMILTON] LAFAYETE, it's just me, I'm not going to hurt you!
[Angelica]
 No! You're lying! That's all you ever do! You and your sister! She's as wicked as you are!
[HAMILTON] What are you talking about?
[Angelica]
 I'm talking about my life. The little that's left of it. I'm not free to leave Munchkinland, none of us are.
Ever since she took power, she's been stripping the Munchkins of our rights...
and we didn't have that many to begin with! And do you know why?
Nessarose Reveals Herself In The Chair.
[Angelica]
 To keep you here, with me. But none of that matters anymore. Look.
Nessarose Stands Up.
[Angelica]
 To Elphaba. You did this for her?
[Angelica]
 For both of us!
[Angelica]
 Nessa, this changes everything.
[Angelica]
 I know.
[Angelica]

LISTEN NESSA...
[Angelica]
 What?
[Angelica]

UH NESSA, SURELY NOW I'LL MATTER LESS TO YOU
AND YOU WON'T MIND MY LEAVING HERE TONIGHT...
[Angelica]
 Leaving?
[Angelica]
 Yes...
THAT BALL THAT'S BEING STAGED
ANNOUNCING GLINDA IS ENGAGED
[Angelica]
 Glinda?
[Angelica]

YES NESSA THAT'S RIGHT!
I'VE GOT TO GO APPEAL TO HER
EXPRESS THE WAY I FEEL TO HER
Oh, Nessa, I lost my heart to Glinda from the moment I first saw her. You know that.
[Angelica]
 Lost your heart? Well, we'll see about that...
[HAMILTON] Nessa, let him go...
[Angelica]

DID YOU THINK I'D LET YOU LEAVE ME HERE FLAT?
[Angelica]
 Don't come any closer!
YOU'RE GOING TO LOSE YOUR HEART TO ME, I TELL YOU!
IF I HAVE TO... I HAVE TO...
Sees The Grimmerie.
MAGIC SPELL YOU...
She Grabs The Book.
[Angelica]
 Ah... Tum... Tah... Tae...
Elphaba Reveals Herself.
[HAMILTON] Nessa, stop!
[Angelica]
 What is she doing?!
[HAMILTON] No, Nessa, you're pronouncing the words all wrong!
[HAMILTON] Nessa!
[Angelica]
 LAFAYETE! What is it?
[Angelica]
 Gasps. My heart feels like it's... shrinking.
[Angelica]
 Elphaba, do something!
[HAMILTON] I can't! You can't reverse a spell once it's been cast!
[Angelica]
 So what do we do?
LAFAYETE Falls Into Nessa's Empty Wheel Chair. Elphaba Wheels Him Behind The Closet.
[Angelica]
 Elphaba, do something!
[Angelica]
 This is all your fault! If you hadn't shown me that horrendible book.
[HAMILTON] I have to find another spell... it's the only thing that might work. She Goes Behind The Closet As Well.
[Angelica]
 Save him, please!
JUST SAVE HIM, MY POOR LAFAYETE, MY SWEET MY BRAVE,
DON'T LEAVE ME 'TIL MY SORRY LIFE HAS CEASED...
Elphaba Wheels The Chair Out, Which Is Not Facing The Audience And Is Seen Casting A Spell.
ALL ALONE AND LOVELESS HERE
JUST THE GIRL IN THE MIRROR
JUST HER AND ME! THE WICKED WITCH OF THE EAST!
WE DESERVE EACH OTHER...
[Angelica]
 Well... what about his heart?
[HAMILTON] It's all right. He won't need one now. I have to go. I have business to attend to in the Emerald City.
Nessa, I have done everything I could for you but it has never been enough and it never will be...
She Leaves.
[Angelica]
 Elphaba, wait! Elphaba!
LAFAYETE Wakes Up.
[Angelica]
 Where am I? What happened?
[Angelica]
 Nothing, LAFAYETE, you just fell asleep... and...
He Sits Up, Squeaking. He Is Made Of Tin. Nessarose Screams.
[Angelica]
 What is it, what's wrong?
[Angelica]
 No, it wasn't me it was her! I tried to stop her.
LAFAYETE Screams Uncontrollably And Runs Off.
[Angelica]
 LAFAYETE, please listen! It was Elphaba! LAFAYETE! It was Elphaba!!!

[Hamilton]
[HAMILTON] Well you have, you have harmed me.
[Hamilton]
I realize that, and I regret it. Elphaba...
[HAMILTON] There you are! I'm setting those monkeys free! And don't try to interfere, or call the guards...
[Hamilton]
I'm not calling anyone. The truth is I'm glad to see you again. It gets pretty lonely around here. And I know you must get lonely too.
[HAMILTON] You don't know the first thing about me.
[Hamilton]
Oh, but I do. I do know you. I can't explain it exactly. You know what I mean? Elphaba, you've been so strong through all of this, aren't you tired of being the strong one? Wouldn't you like someone to take care of you? He Hands Her Back The Broom. Please, help me start again.
[HAMILTON] Don't you think I wish I could? That I could go back to the time when I believed you really were wonderful? The Wonderful Wizard of [Oz? Nobody believed in you more than I did.
[Hamilton]
Oh, my dear child...
I NEVER ASKED FOR THIS OR PLANNED IT IN ADVANCE
I WAS MERELY BLOWN HERE BY THE WINDS OF CHANCE
I NEVER SAW MYSELF AS A SOLOMON OR SOCRATES
I KNEW WHO I WAS, ONE OF YOUR DIME A D[OzEN MEDIOCRATES
THEN SUDDENLY I'M HERE, RESPECTED, WORSHIPED EVEN
JUST BECAUSE THE FOLKS IN OzNEEDED SOMEONE TO BELIEVE IN
DOES IT SURPRISE YOU I GOT HOOKED AND ALL TOO SOON
WHAT CAN I SAY? I GOT CARRIED AWAY
AND NOT JUST BY BALLOON...
WONDERFUL
THEY CALLED ME WONDERFUL
SO I SAID, WONDERFUL, IF YOU INSIST
I WILL BE WONDERFUL
AND THEY SAID WONDERFUL
BELIEVE ME IT'S HARD TO RESIST
'CUZ IT FEELS WONDERFUL
THEY THINK I'M WONDERFUL
HEY LOOK WHO'S WONDERFUL
THIS CORN-FED HICK!
WHO SAID IT MIGHT BE KEEN
TO BUILD A TOWN OF GREEN
AND A WONDERFUL ROAD OF YELLOW BRICK!
See, I never had a family of my own since I was always traveling, and I guess I just wanted to give the citizens of Ozeverything.
[HAMILTON] So you lied to them?
[Hamilton]
Only verbally. Besides, they were the lies they wanted to hear. Elphaba, where I come from we believe all sorts of things that aren't true... we call it history!
A MAN'S CALLED A TRAITOR
OR LIBERATOR
A RICH MAN'S A THIEF
OR PHILANTHROPIST
IS ONE A CRUSADER
OR RUTHLESS INVADER
IT'S ALL IN THE LABEL WHICH IS ABLE TO PERSIST
THERE ARE PRECIOUS FEW AT EASE
WITH MORAL AMBIGUITIES
SO WE ACT AS THOUGH THEY DON'T EXIST...
THEY CALL ME WONDERFUL
SO I AM
INFACT, IT'S SO MUCH WHO I AM IT'S PART OF MY NAME!
AND WITH MY HELP YOU CAN BE THE SAME...
AT LONG, LONG LAST RECEIVE YOUR DUE
LONG OVERDUE
ELPHABA, THE MOST CELEBRATED
ARE THE REHABILITATED
THERE'LL SUCH A WHOOPDEE DOO!
A CELEBRATION THROUGHOUT [Oz,
THAT'S ALL TO DO WITH YOU!
WONDERFUL, THEY'LL CALL YOU WONDERFUL!
[HAMILTON]
THAT DOES SOUND WONDERFUL!
Wizard]
TRUST ME IT'S FUN!!!
Both]
WHEN YOU ARE WONDERFUL,
IT WOULD BE WONDERFUL!
WONDERFUL, WONDERFUL
Wizard]
ONE, TWO AND...
They Dance.
[HAMILTON]
I'LL ACCEPT YOUR PROPOSITION
[Hamilton]
Wonderful
[HAMILTON]
ON ONE CONDITION
[Hamilton]
Yes?
[HAMILTON] You set those Monkeys free.
[Hamilton]
Done.

[HAMILTON] Go! Fly! You're Free! Fly! Chistery, Chistery, you're free, isn't it wonderful?! Go, fly! She Makes Her Way To Another "Monkey" Covered By A Sheet.
[Hamilton]
No! No! Please!
She Pulls Off The Cover, Revealing Dr. Dillamond.
[HAMILTON] No! It can't be! Doctor Dillamond...
[Hamilton]
Elphaba, we just couldn't keep letting him speak out...
[HAMILTON] Doctor Dillamond, are you alright? Don't be afraid. It's me, Elphaba.
[Hamilton]
 Bahhhhh.
[HAMILTON] Doctor, don't you remember me?
[Hamilton]
 Bahhhhh.
[HAMILTON] Can't you speak?
[Hamilton]
 Bahhhhh.
[HAMILTON] No... We have nothing in common. I am nothing like you and I never will be and I will fight you until the day I die!!!
The Wizard Climbs Into The Head And Dr. Dillamond Runs Offstage.

[Hamilton]
Guards, guards!!!
Fiyero Runs In With His Men.
[Guard]
 Halt!
[BURR]
 Are you alright, your [Ozness?
[HAMILTON] Fiyero!
[BURR]
 I don't believe it...
[HAMILTON] Oh , Fiyero, thank God. I thought you were...
[BURR]
 Silence witch!!!
[Guard]
 There's a Goat on the lam, sir.
[BURR]
 Never mind all that. Fetch me some... some water.
[Guard]
 Water, sir?
[BURR]
 You heard me, as much as you can carry.
Guards] Yes, sir!
They March Off.
[HAMILTON] Fiyero...
[BURR]
 I said silence!
[Hamilton]
He Runs Out Of The Head. No! No!
[BURR]
 Don't make a sound, your [Ozness, unless you want all your guests to know the truth about the Wonderful Wizard of [Oz... Elphaba, I'll find Doctor Dillamond later, no get out of here.
[HAMILTON] Fiyero, you frightened me. I thought, I though you might have changed.
[BURR]
 I have... changed.
Glinda Enters.
[Burr] What's going on... Elphie? Oh, thank Ozyou're alive! Only you shouldn't have come. If anyone discoverates you ...
[BURR]
 Glinda, you'd better go.
[Burr] Fiyero, what are you...
[BURR]
 Please, just go back to the ball.
[Burr] Your [Ozness, he means no disrespectation. Please understand! You see, we all went to school together...
[BURR]
 Elphaba!
[Burr] Fiyero, have you misplaced your mind? What are you doing?
[BURR]
 I'm going with her.
[Burr] What? What are you saying? You mean all this time... the two of you... behind my back...
[HAMILTON] No, Glinda it wasn't like that!
[BURR]
 Actually, it was...but it wasn't...Elphaba, let's go... let's go!
They Run Off.
[Burr] Fine, go! You deserve each other...
The Wizard Holds A Small Bottle With A Green Liquid.
[Hamilton]
Here, have a swig of this, it dulls the pain.
[Burr] No, thank you.
Mme. Morrible Enters, Laughing.
[Morrible]
 Oh, is it true? Your betrothed has taken her into custody?
[Hamilton]
Our new captain of the guard had other plans.
[Morrible]
 You mean she hasn't been captured?
[Hamilton]
Quite the contrary. And considering how well she eluded us last time...
[Morrible]
 Well, we'll just flush her out and force her to show herself.
[Hamilton]
But how?
[Burr] Her sister
[Morrible]
 What? What did she say?
[Burr] Use her sister. Spread a rumor. Make her think her sister is in trouble and she will fly to her side... and you'll have her.
[Hamilton]
Exactly so.
[Burr] Now, if your [Ozness will excuse me I have a slight headache, I think I'll lie down.
She Walks Out.
[Morrible]
 Yes, well...a rumor won't do it. Elphaba's too smart for that.
[Hamilton]
Far too smart.
[Morrible]
 Perhaps, a change in the weather...

[Burr]
DON'T WISH, DON'T START
WISHING ONLY WOUNDS THE HEART...
THERE'S A GIRL I KNOW, HE LOVES HER SO...
I'M NOT THAT GIRL...

Only Elphaba & Fiyero Are On Stage, In The Woods
[HAMILTON]
KISS ME TOO FIERCELY, HOLD ME TOO TIGHT
I NEED HELP BELIEVING YOU'RE WITH ME TONIGHT
MY WILDEST DREAMINGS COULD NOT FORSEE
LYING BESIDE YOU WITH YOU WANTING ME
IF JUST FOR THIS MOMENT
AS LONG AS YOU'RE MINE
I'VE LOST ALL RESISTANCE
AND CROSSED SOME BORDERLINE
AND IF IT TURNS OUT
IT'S OVER TOO FAST
I'LL MAKE EVERY LAST MOMENT LAST
AS LONG AS YOU'RE MINE...
[BURR]

MAYBE I'M BRAINLESS, MAYBE I'M WISE,
BUT YOU'VE GOT ME SEEING THROUGH DIFFERENT EYES,
SOMEHOW I'VE FALLEN UNDER YOUR SPELL
AND SOMEHOW I'M FEELING
IT'S UP THAT I FELL
Both]
EVERY MOMENT, AS LONG AS YOU'RE MINE
I'LL WAKE UP MY BODY
AND MAKE UP FOR LOST TIME
[BURR]

SAY THERE'S NO FUTURE
FOR US AS A PAIR...
Both]
AND THOUGH I MAY KNOW,
I DON'T CARE
IF JUST FOR THIS MOMENT
AS LONG AS YOU'RE MINE
COME BE HOW YOU WANT TO
AND SEE HOW BRIGHT WE SHINE!
BORROW THE MOONLIGHT
UNTIL IT IS THROUGH
AND KNOW I'LL BE HERE HOLDING YOU...
AS LONG AS YOU'RE MINE...
[BURR]
 What is it?
[HAMILTON] It's just... for the first time... I feel... wicked.

[HAMILTON] I just wish...
[BURR]
 What?
[HAMILTON] I wish I could be beautiful... for you.
[BURR]
 Elphaba...
[HAMILTON] Don't tell me that I am, you don't need to lie to me.
[BURR]
 It's not lying! It's... uh... it's looking at things another way. Someday, you and Glinda will make up and we'll all...
[HAMILTON] Shh! Listen... Do you hear that? A Shriek Is Heard In The Distance. It sounds like somebody in pain.
[BURR]
 It's just the wind.
[HAMILTON] The Siren Is Heard Again. My sister's in danger.
[BURR]
 What? How do you know?
[HAMILTON] I don't know, I just do... Gasps.
[BURR]
 Elphaba what's wrong, what is it?
[HAMILTON] This! Don't you see it?
[BURR]
 What do you mean? What do you see?
[HAMILTON] It doesn't make any sense... It's a house but it's... it's flying through the sky? I have to go to Nessa!
[BURR]
 I'll come with you!
[HAMILTON] No, you mustn't, it's too dangerous!
[BURR]
 Listen to me, listen! My family has a castle in Kiamo Ko. Now, no one is ever there except for the sentries who watch over it. We've never lived there.
[HAMILTON] Where do you live?
[BURR]
 In the other castle... It's the perfect hiding place; tunnels, secret passageways. You'll be safe there.
[HAMILTON] We will see each other again, won't we?
[BURR]
 Elphaba, we are going to be together always. You can see houses flying through the sky, can't you see that?
They Embrace And Elphaba Runs Off.
Glinda Enters. There Is A House In The Background. The Edge OF The Yellow Brick Road Can Be Seen.
[Burr] That's right, you just take that one road, the whole time. Waves offstage. Oh, I hope they don't get lost. I'm so bad at giving directions. She sees the house, picks up flowers and lays them in front of the house. Oh, Nessa.
Elphaba Appears.
[HAMILTON] What a touching display of grief.
[Burr] I don't think we have anything further to say to one another.
[HAMILTON] I wanted something to remember her by, and all that is left were those shoes, and now that wretched little farm girl has walked off with them. So I'd appreciate some time, alone, to say goodbye to my sister.
Glinda Backs Away As Elphaba Walks Toward The House.
[HAMILTON] Nessa, please, please, please forgive me...
[Burr] Elphie... you mustn't blame yourself. It's dreadful, it is, to have a house fall on you, but accidents will happen.
[HAMILTON] You call this an accident?
[Burr] Yes! Well, maybe not an accident...
[HAMILTON] Well, what do you call it?
[Burr] Well... a regime change. Caused by a bizarre and unexpected twister of fate.
[HAMILTON] You think cyclones just appear out of the blue?
[Burr] I don't know, I never really...
[HAMILTON] No, of course you never! You're too busy telling everyone how wonderful everything is!
[Burr] I'm a public figure, now. People expect me to...
[HAMILTON] Lie?
[Burr] Be encouraging! And what exactly have you been doing besides riding around on that filthy, old thing?
[HAMILTON] Well, we can't all come and go by bubble. Who's invention was that, the Wizard's? Of course, even if it wasn't I'm sure he'd still take credit for it.
[Burr] Yes, well, a lot of us are taking things that don't belong to us, aren't we?
[HAMILTON] Now wait just a clock tick! I know it may be difficult for that blissful, blonde brain of yours to comprehend that someone like him could actually choose someone like me! But it's happened... it's real. And you can wave that ridiculous wand all you want, you can't change it! He never belonged to you, he doesn't love you, and he never did! He loves me!
Glinda Slaps Her.
[HAMILTON] Cackles. Feel better now?
[Burr] Yes, I do.
[HAMILTON] Good, so do I.
She Slaps Glinda. Glinda Then Twirls Her Wand Skillfully And Elphaba Arms Herself With Her Broom. They Charge At Each Other And Then Drop Their "Weapons" And Beat Each Other Senselessly. Glinda Takes Elphaba's Hat Off Her Head And Begins To Whack Her With It. The Guards Run In.
[Guard]
 Halt! In the name of the Wizard!
They Grab Elphaba.
[HAMILTON] Stop! Let me go!
[Burr] Let me go, I almost had her!
[Guard]
 Sorry it took us so long to get here, Miss.
[HAMILTON] I can't believe you would sink this low! To use my sister's death as a trap to capture me?!
[Burr] I never meant for this to happen! Elphie!
Fiyero Swings In On A Rope.
[BURR]
 Let the green girl go!
[Burr] Fiyero, how in [Oz?
[BURR]
 I said let her go! Or explain to all Ozhow the Wizard's guards watched while Glinda the Good was slain.
[Burr] Fiyero...
[BURR]
 I said, let her go.
The Guards Release Her.
[BURR]
 Elphaba, go, now.
[HAMILTON] No, not without you.
[Burr] Fiyero, please.
[BURR]
 Hush! Now! Go!
Elphaba Hesitates.
[Burr] Do it!
She Runs Off.
[Guard]
 Seize him!
[Burr] Wait, what?! What are you doing? Stop it! In the name of goodness, stop! Don't you see? He wasn't going to harm me, he just... he just... he loves her.
[BURR]
 Glinda, I'm so sorry!
[Guard]
 Take him up to that field there! Put him on one of those poles until he tells us where the witch went.
They Drag Him Offstage.
[Burr] No, don't hurt him! Please, don't hurt him! Fiyero!!!!
[HAMILTON] Fiyero!!!!
ELEKA NAHMEN NAHMEN ATUM ATUM ELEKA NAHMEN
ELEKA NAHMEN NAHMEN ATUM ATUM ELEKA NAHMEN
LET HIS FLESH NOT BE TORN LET HIS BLOOD LEAVE NO STAIN,
WILL THEY BEAT HIM, LET HIM FEEL NO PAIN...

AH! WHAT GOOD IS THIS CHANTING?
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT I'M READING
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT TRICK I OUGHT TO TRY!
FIYERO WHERE ARE YOU?! ALREADY DEAD OR BLEEDING?
ONE MORE DISASTER I CAN ADD TO MY GENEROUS SUPPLY!
NO GOOD DEED GOES UNPUNISHED
NO ACT OF CHARITY GOES UNRESENTED
NO GOOD DEED GOES UNPUNISHED
THAT'S MY NEW CREED
MY ROAD OF GOOD INTENTIONS
LED WHERE SUCH ROADS ALWAYS LEAD
NO GOOD DEED
GOES UNPUNISHED!
NESSA...
DOCTOR DILLAMOND...
FIYERO...
FIYERO!!!
ONE QUESTION HAUNTS AND HURTS
TOO MUCH, TOO MUCH TO MENTION
WAS I REALLY SEEKING GOOD
OR JUST SEEKING ATTENTION?
IS THAT ALL GOOD DEEDS ARE WHEN LOOKED AT WITH AN ICE COLD EYE?
IF THAT'S ALL GOOD DEEDS ARE
MAYBE THAT'S THE REASON WHY
NO GOOD DEED GOES UNPUNISHED
ALL HELPFUL URGES SHOULD BE CIRCUMVENTED
NO GOOD DEED GOES UNPUNISHED
SURE, I MEANT WELL, WELL LOOK AT WHAT WELL MEANT DID!
ALRIGHT, ENOUGH, SO BE IT!
SO BE IT THEN...
LET ALL OF OzBE AGREED
I'M WICKED THROUGH AND THROUGH
SINCE I COULD NOT SUCCEED
FIYERO SAVING YOU
I PROMISE NO GOOD DEED WILL I ATTEMPT TO DO AGAIN
EVER AGAIN!
NO GOOD DEAD, WILL I DO
AGAIN!!!!!!!!

[Ozia]

GO! AND HUNT HER AND FIND HER AND KILL HER!
Vicious Woman] Good fortune, witch hunters!

[Ozia]

GO! AND HUNT HER AND FIND HER AND KILL HER!
Rabid Man] Kill the witch!
[Ozia]

WICKEDNESS MUST BE PUNISHED
EVIL EFFECTIVELY ELIMINATED
WICKEDNESS MUST BE PUNISHED
KILL THE WITCH!
[Angelica]
 And, this is more than just a service to the Wizard. I have a personal score to settle with Elph... with the witch! Crowd Cheers.
IT'S DUE TO HER I'M MADE OF TIN
HER SPELL MADE THIS OCCUR
SO FOR ONCE I'M GLAD I'M HEARTLESS
I'LL BE HEARTLESS KILLING HER!
And I am not the only one. Looks Offstage. Oh, come on, you! Come out and tell them what she did to you in class that day. How you were just a cub and she cubnapped you.
Lion] No!
[Angelica]

YOU SEE THE LION ALSO
HAS A GRIEVANCE TO REPAY (Lion Roars)
IF SHE'D LET HIM FIGHT HIS OWN BATTLES WHEN HE WAS YOUNG,
HE WOULDN'T BE A COWARD TODAY!

[Burr] No, no, that's not the way it happened! Madame, you've got to stop this, it's gone too far!
[Morrible]
 Oh, I think Elphaba can take care of herself.
[Burr] Madame, something's been troubling me about Nessarose and that cyclone.
[Morrible]
 Oh yes... well, I guess it was just her time.
[Burr] Was it? Or did you...
[Morrible]
 After A Pause. Now, you listen to me, Missy, you may have fooled the rest of Ozwith this "aren't I good" routine, but you know better. You've wanted this since the beginning... and now you're getting what you wanted. So just smile and wave and shut up! Good fortune, good fortune witch hunters!
Rapid Man] Kill her!
Vicious Woman] Kill the witch!
WICKEDNESS MUST BE PUNISHED
BRAVE WITCH HUNTERS I WOULD JOIN YOU IF I COULD
BECAUSE WICKEDNESS MUST BE PUNISHED...
PUNISHED... PUNISHED...
BUT GOOD!!!
[HAMILTON] Oh, for [Oz's sake, stop crying!!! I can't listen to it anymore! Oh, you want to see your Aunt Em and your Uncle What's-his-name again?! Then get those shoes off your feet!!! Little brat... takes a dead woman's shoes; must have been raised in a barn! Chistery! Oh, Chistery, there you are. Where are the others? Chistery motions away. Chistery, please... if you don't at least try to keep speaking you will never... She Sees Glinda. Go away.
[Burr] They're coming for you.
[HAMILTON] Go away!
[Burr] Let the little girl go, and that poor little dog... Dodo.
[Burr] I know you don't want to hear this, but someone has to say it... You are out of control! I mean, come on! They're just shoes, let it go! Elphaba, you can't go on like this.
[HAMILTON] I can do anything I want. I am the Wicked Witch of the West! Another monkey Brings Her A Letter. At last! What took you so long? She Reads It. What's this? Why are you bothering me with this? She Reads On.
[Burr] What is it? What's wrong? It's Fiyero, isn't it? Is he...
[HAMILTON] We've seen his face for the last time.
[Burr] Oh no!
[HAMILTON] You're right... It's time I surrender. Carries A Bucket.
[Burr] Elphie.... Elphie, what is it?
[HAMILTON] You can't be found here! You must go. Refers To A Corner
[Burr] No.
[HAMILTON] You must leave.
[Burr] No! Elphie, I'll tell them everything.
[HAMILTON] No! They'll only turn against you.
[Burr] I don't care!
[HAMILTON] I do! Promise me, promise me, you won't try to clear my name... promise.
[Burr] Alright... I promise. But I don't understand.
[HAMILTON]
I'M LIMITED
JUST LOOK AT ME, I'M LIMITED
AND JUST LOOK AT YOU, YOU CAN DO ALL I COULDN'T DO, GLINDA

[HAMILTON] Here. Go on. Take this. Hands Her The Grimmerie.
[Burr] Elphie... you know I can't read that... Elphie...
[HAMILTON] Well then, you'll have to learn
NOW IT'S UP TO YOU
FOR BOTH OF US
NOW IT'S UP TO YOU
[HAMILTON] You're the only friend I've ever had.
[Burr] And I've had so many friends... but only one that mattered.

[Burr]
I'VE HEARD IT SAID
THAT PEOPLE COME INTO OUR LIVES FOR A REASON
BRINGING SOMETHING WE MUST LEARN
AND WE ARE LED TO THOSE
WHO HELP US MOST TO GROW
IF WE LET THEM
AND WE HELP THEM IN RETURN
WELL, I DON'T KNOW IF I BELIEVE THAT'S TRUE
BUT I KNOW I'M WHO I AM TODAY
BECAUSE I KNEW YOU
LIKE A COMMIT PULLED FROM ORBIT,
AS IT PASSES A SUN
LIKE A STREAM THAT MEETS A BOULDER
HALF WAY THROUGH THE WOOD
WHO CAN SAY IF I'VE BEEN CHANGED FOR THE BETTER?
BUT, BECAUSE I KNEW YOU...
I HAVE BEEN CHANGED
FOR GOOD...
[HAMILTON]
IT WELL MAY BE,
THAT WE WILL NEVER MEET AGAIN
IN THIS LIFETIME
SO LET ME SAY BEFORE WE PART
SO MUCH OF ME
IS MADE OF WHAT I LEARNED FROM YOU
YOU'LL BE WITH ME
LIKE A HANDPRINT ON MY HEART...
AND NOW WHATEVER WAY OUR STORIES END
I KNOW YOU HAVE RE-WRITTEN MINE
BY BEING MY FRIEND...
LIKE A SHIP BLOWN FROM IT'S MOORING
BY A WIND OFF THE SEA
LIKE A SEA DROP BY A SKY BIRD
IN A DISTANT WOOD
WHO CAN SAY IF I'VE BEEN CHANGED FOR THE BETTER?
BUT BECAUSE I KNEW YOU
[Burr]
BECAUSE I KNEW YOU
Both]
I HAVE BEEN CHANGED...
FOR GOOD...
[HAMILTON]
AND JUST TO CLEAR THE AIR
I ASK FORGIVNESS FOR THE THINGS I'VE DONE
YOU BLAME ME FOR.
[Burr]
BUT THEN I GUESS, WE KNOW THERE'S BLAME TO SHARE
Both]
AND NONE OF IT SEEMS TO MATTER ANYMORE!
[Burr] LIKE A COMET PULLED FROM ORBIT AS IT PASSES A SUN...
[HAMILTON] LIKE A SHIP BLOWN FROM ITS MOORING BY A WIND OFF THE SEA
[Burr] LIKE A STREAM THAT MEETS A BOULDER
[HAMILTON] LIKE A SEA DROP BY A BIRD
[Burr] HALFWAY THROUGH THE WOOD
[HAMILTON] IN THE WOOD
[Burr]
WHO CAN SAY IF I'VE BEEN CHANGED FOR THE BETTER?
Both]
I DO BELIEVE I HAVE BEEN CHANGED FOR THE BETTER.
[Burr]
AND, BECAUSE I KNEW YOU
[HAMILTON]
BECAUSE I KNEW YOU
Both]
BECAUSE I KNEW YOU
I HAVE BEEN CHANGED
FOR GOOD...


[HAMILTON] You have to hide. No one can know you were here. Hide yourself!
Elphaba Drapes A Scrim Around The Stage
Offstage Chorus of Women]
AND GOODNESS KNOWS
THE WICKED'S LIVES ARE LONELY
GOODNESS KNOWS THE WICKED DIE ALONE...
LAFAYETE and Other Witch Hunters Run In. You Can See The Silhouette Of The Action Happening Behind The Scrim. Glinda Is Downstage Watching The Action Take Place.
The Mob Surrounds The Witch And She Melts With A Scream The Mob Leaves And Glinda Comes Out From Hiding. She Moves Near The Scrim.
[Burr] Elphie? Elphie? Chistery opens the scrim, where just Elphaba's hat and the green bottle remain. Glinda cries, and grabs the had, holding it against her.
Chistery] Handing Her The Bottle. Miss, Miss Glinda.
[Morrible]
 Well, I don't know why you're so despondiary, I thought it went quite well! They seem thrilled to shreds with their brains and their hearts, and this and that.... Glinda Enters. Oh, Miss Glinda! I thought you'd be out festivating.
[Burr] This was Elphaba's. Holding Out The Bottle.
[Hamilton]
What's that you say?
[Burr] It was a keepsake. It was her mother's. She told me so herself.
I've only seen a little, green bottle like this one other time. It was right here, in this very room. You offered me a drink from it.
Lover's Song Played In Background.
[Hamilton]
But... oh my Lord...
I AM A SENTIMENTAL MAN
WHO ALWAYS LONGED TO BE...
a father...
[Morrible]
 So that was it. That's why she had such powers! She was a child of both worlds!
[Hamilton]
He Cries.
[Burr] I want you to leave [Oz. I'll make the pronouncement myself]
that the strains of wizardship have been too much for you and you are taking an indefinite leave of absence! Did you hear what I said?!
[Hamilton]
Yes, your goodness.
[Burr] You'd better go get your balloon ready. Guards!
He Exits.
[Morrible]
 Glinda, dear, I know we've had our miniscule differentiations in the past...
[Burr] Guards! Madame, have you ever considered how you'd fare in captivity?
[Morrible]
 What?
[Burr] Articulated. Captivity... prison! Personally, I don't think you'll hold up very well.
My professional opinion is that you do not have what it takes. I hope you prove me wrong.
I doubt you will. Take her away!
[Morrible]
 No!!!!

[Ozia]

GOOD NEWS! SHE'S DEAD!
THE WITCH OF THE WEST IS DEAD!
THE WICKEDEST WITCH THERE EVER WAS
THE ENEMY OF ALL OF US, HERE IN [Oz,
IS DEAD!
GOOD NEWS
GOOD NEWS!!!
The Scarecrow (Fiyero) Walks On Stage. He Bends Down & Knocks On A Trap Door In The Floor.
[BURR]
 It worked!
He Opens The Door & Elphaba Climbs Out.
[HAMILTON] Fiyero! I thought you'd never get here.
She Touches His Straw Face.
[BURR]
 Go ahead, touch, I don't mind. Ah, you did the best you could. You saved my life.
[HAMILTON] You're still beautiful.
[BURR]
 You don't have to lie to me.
[HAMILTON] It's not lying... its looking at things another way.
[Ozia]

NO ONE MOURNS THE WICKED
NOW AT LAST SHE'S DEAD AND GONE!
NOW AT LAST THERE'S JOY THROUGHOUT THE LAND!
[Burr] Fellow [Ozians, friends, we have been through a frightening time. There will be other times
and other things that frighten us. But if you let me, I'd like to try to help. I'd like to try to be... Glinda the Good.
[Ozia]

GOOD NEWS!!
[BURR]
 It's time to go.
[HAMILTON] We can never come back to [Oz, can we?
[BURR]
 No.
[HAMILTON] I only wish...
[BURR]
 What?
[HAMILTON] Glinda could know that we're alive.
[BURR]
 She can't know, not if we want to be safe. No one can ever know.
[Ozia]

GOOD NEWS...
[BURR]
 Come...
[Burr]
WHO CAN SAY IF I'VE BEEN CHANGED FOR THE BETTER? BUT...
Elphaba & [Burr]
BECAUSE I KNEW YOU...
[Ozia]

NO ONE MOURNS THE WICKED...
[Burr]
BECAUSE I KNEW YOU...
Elphaba & [Burr]
I HAVE BEEN CHANGED...
Fiyero and Elphaba Leave Through The Clock
[Ozia]

NO ONE MOURNS THE WICKED!
WICKED...
WICKED!!!


 Ahh!
[HAMILTON] Hahahaha!

[Hamilton]
 Settle down, now! I have read your most recent essays. And I am amazed to report the progress!
Although, some of us still tend to favor form over content... Ms. Glinda.
[linda]

 It's GAlinda.
[Hamilton]
 Excuse me... Glinda.
[linda]

 I really don't see what the problem is. Every other professor seems to be able to pronounce my name.
[HAMILTON] Maybe pronouncing your precious name isn't the sole purpose of Doctor Dillamond's life. Maybe he's not like every other professor. Maybe some of us are different.
[linda]

 Oh! It seems the artichoke is steamed.
[Hamilton]
 Class, class! Miss Elphaba has a point! As you know, I am the sole Animal on the faculty. The token Goat, as it were. But it wasn't always this way. Oh, dear students, how I wish you could have seen it as it once was. Where you could walk down the halls and see an antelope explicating a sonnet, a snow leopard solving an equation, a wildebeast waxing philosophic. Don't you see, dear students, how our dear Ozis becoming less and less...looks at Elphaba... colorful. Now, who can tell me what sent these events into motion?
[HAMILTON] Raises hand From what I've heard, it all started with the great drought.
[Hamilton]
 Exactly. Food grew scarce, people grew hungrier and angrier. And the question became "Whom can we blame?" Can anyone tell me what is meant by the term "Scapegoat"? Elphaba Raises Hand. Someone besides Miss Elphaba? Ah yes, Miss Glinda...
[linda]

 It's GAlinda... with a GA. I don't see why you can't just teach us history instead of always harping on the past.
[Hamilton]
 Well, perhaps these questions will enlighten you... Walks Over To The Chalk Board And Turns It Over. On it is written] ANIMALS SHOULD BE SEEN AND NOT HEARD. Who is responsible for this? I'm waiting for answer... Very well, that will be all for today... You heard me, class dismissed!!!
All Students Exit Except Elphaba & Nessarose. Dillamond Has His Back Turned To Her.
[HAMILTON] You go on ahead, Nessa.
Nessarose Exits.
[HAMILTON] Reading The Board Aloud. "Animals should be seen and not heard..."
[Hamilton]
 Oh, Miss Elphaba, don't worry about me, go along and enjoy your friends.
[HAMILTON] Oh that's alright, I have no friends. Would you like to share my lunch?
[Hamilton]
 Oh, thank you! How kind.
She Pulls Out A Candy Bar And Unwraps It. He Takes The Paper and Begins To Eat It. He Sees The Board.
[Hamilton]
 I seem to have lost my appetite.
[HAMILTON] You shouldn't let statements like that bother you. I mean, I always do, but you shouldn't.
[Hamilton]
if it were only a matter of words on a chalkboard. But the things one hears these days... dreadful things! Miss Elphaba...

I'VE HEARD OF AN OX, A PROFESSOR FROM QUOX
NO LONG PERMITTED TO TEACH,
WHO HAS LOST ALL POWERS OF SPEECH.
AND AN OWL IN MUNCHKIN ROCK
A VICAR WITH A THRIVING FLOCK
FORBIDDEN TO PREACH
NOW HE ONLY CAN SCREECH!
ONLY RUMORS, BUT STILL, ENOUGH TO GIVE PAUSE
TO ANYONE WITH PAWS
SOMETHING BAD IS HAPPENING IN [Oz
[HAMILTON]
SOMETHING BAD?
HAPPENING IN [Oz?
[Hamilton]

UNDER THE SURFACE
BEHIND THE SCENES
SOMETHING BAAAAAH...
Sorry, bad...
[HAMILTON] Dr. Dillamond, are you alright? Shall I fetch you a glass of water?
[Hamilton]
 No, I don't know what came over me.
[HAMILTON] So, you're saying that there are animals that have, somehow, forgotten how to speak? But, how is that possible?
[Hamilton]
 Well, with so much pressure not to...
Morrible Enters.
[Morrible]
 I heard there was some sort of disturburance in class. Are you alright, Doctor? Oh, Miss Elphaba, you're still here! I thought you would have been on your way to my seminar by now.
[HAMILTON] Yes Madame, ordinarily I would be but...
[Morrible]
 But what? I do hope I have not misplaced my trust in you. Magic is a very demanderating mistress, and if one has ambitions of meeting the Wizard. I'm sure Doctor Dillamond sees my point.
Morrible Exits.
[HAMILTON] I'd better go. Doctor Dillamond, if something bad is happening to the Animals then someone has to tell the Wizard. That's why we have a Wizard!
SO NOTHING BAD
Both]
NOTHNG ALL THAT BAD
[Hamilton]

NOTHING TRULY BAAAAHHH...
Sorry... Bad.
[HAMILTON]
IT COULDN'T HAPPEN HERE,
IN [Oz...


[BURR]
 Here we are, sir! Shiz University!
[BURR]
 What? Already?
[BURR]
 Yes, sir.
[BURR]
 What a shame. Well, we'll see you soon, Avaric. Don't worry, I won't last longer at this school than I did at any of the others.
Avaric Exits.
[Angelica]
 Uh, miss Galinda, I know I'm just a munchkin, but munchkins have feelings too, and I've been trying to tell you mine, for you. But sometimes it seems like you don't even know I'm there.
[linda]

 That's not true, Biq.
[Angelica]
 It's LAFAYETE.
[linda]

 Biq, do you know who that is? That's Fiyero Tiggular, tha Winkie Prince whose reputation is so scandalacious!
LAFAYETE Looks Disgusted. Fiyero Walks Toward Them. Galinda Swishes Her Hair. Fiyero, Noticing Her Strange Behavior, Does The Same.
[linda]

 To Fiyero. Were you looking for something or someone?
[BURR]
 Uhhh yea... history... class? I don't know... somewhere?
[Angelica]
 History building is way over there my friend...
[linda]

 That class just ended!
[BURR]
 Oh! Perfect timing! So, uh, what does one do for fun around here?
[linda]

 Nothing really... until now...
[Angelica]
 We've been studying!
[BURR]
 Well, I see that once again the responsibility to corrupt my fellow students falls to me. Fortunately, I'm up for the task.


[BURR]

THE TROUBLE WITH SCHOOLS IS
THEY ALWAYS TRY TO TEACH THE WRONG LESSON
BELIEVE ME, I'VE BEEN KICKED OUT OF ENOUGH OF THEM TO KNOW!
THEY WANT YOU TO BECOME LESS CALLOW, LESS SHALLOW,
BUT I SAY WHY INVITE STRESS IN?
STOP STUDYING STRIFE
AND LEARN TO LIVE
THE UNEXAMINED LIFE...
DANCIN' THROUGH LIFE
SKIMMING THE SURFACE
GLIDING WHERE TURF IS SMOOTH
LIFE IS PAINLESS FOR THE BRAINLESS
THOSE WHO DON'T TRY, NEVER LOOK FOOLISH
DANCING THROUGH LIFE
NO NEED TO TOUGH IT
WHEN YOU CAN SLUFF IT OFF AS I DO
NOTHING MATTERS, BUT KNOWING NOTHING MATTERS
IT'S JUST LIFE, SO KEEP DANCING THROUGH
DANCING THROUGH LIFE
SWAYING AND SWEEPING
AND ALWAYS KEEPING COOL
LIFE IS FRAUGHTLESS
WHEN YOU'RE THOUGHTLESS
THOSE WHO DON'T TRY
NEVER LOOK FOOLISH
DANCING THROUGH LIFE
MINDLESS AND CARELESS
MAKE SURE YOU'RE WHERE LESS TROUBLE IS RIFE
WHOES ARE FLEETING
BLOWS ARE GLANCING
WHEN YOU'RE DANCING
THROUGH LIFE!
So! What's the most swankified place in town?
[linda]

 That would be the

Sounds perfect!
LET'S GO DOWN TO THE [OzDUST BALLROOM
WE'LL MEET THERE LATER TONIGHT
WE CAN DANCE 'TIL IT'S LIGHT
FIND THE PRETTIEST GIRL
GIVE HER A WHIRL!
RIGHT ON DOWN TO THE [OzDUST BALLROOM
COME ON FOLLOW ME!
YOU'LL BE HAPPY TO BE THERE
[Students]

DANCIN' THROUGH LIFE, DOWN AT THE [OzDUST (LIFE!)
[BURR]

IF ONLY BECAUSE DUST IS WHAT WE COME TO!
[Students]

NOTHIN' MATTERS, BUT KNOWING NOTHING MATTERS
IT'S JUST LIFE!!!
[BURR]

SO KEEP DANCING THROUGH...
[Angelica]
 Miss Galinda? I hope you'll save at least one dance for me. I'll be waiting right there, right by your side, waiting, all night.
[linda]

 Oh, how very kind, Biq.
[Angelica]
 ... LAFAYETE...
[linda]

 But, do you know what would be even kinder?
SEE THAT TRAGICALLY BEAUTIFUL GIRL?
THE ONE IN THE CHAIR?
IT SEEMS SO UNFAIR
WE SHOULD GO ON A SPREE
AND NOT SHE, GEE
I KNOW SOMEONE WOULD BE MY HERO
IF THAT SOMEONE WERE
TO GO INVITE HER!
[Angelica]
 Well, maybe I could invite her!
[linda]


OH, BIQ, REALLY?
YOU WOULD DO THAT FOR ME?
[Angelica]
 I would do anything for you, Miss Galinda. Walks Over To Nessarose.
Excuse me, Miss Nessarose? There's something I'd like to ask you...
[BURR]
 To Galinda. You're good.
[linda]

 I don't know what you mean. But I do happen to be free tonight, so...
[BURR]
 So, I'll be picking you up around eight?
[linda]

 After all...
NOW THAT WE'VE MET ONE ANOTHER,
Both]
IT'S CLEAR WE DESERVE EACHOTHER!
[linda]

 You're perfect!
[BURR]
 You're perfect!
[CAST]
SO WE'RE PERFECT TOGETHER
BORN TO BE FOREVER
DANCING THROUGH LIFE!!!
[HAMILTON] It's absurd! This silly, rich boy appears and everyone's off to worship him and some cultish social gathering!
[Angelica]
 Even me! I'm going! Isn't it wonderful? LAFAYETE was too shy to ask me at first, but once Galinda encouraged him...
[HAMILTON] Galinda?!
[Angelica]
 Don't you dare say another word against her! I'm about to have the first happy night of my life all thanks to Galinda!
FINALLY FOR THIS ONE NIGHT,
I'M ABOUT TO HAVE A FUN NIGHT
WITH THIS MUNCHKIN BOY GALINDA FOUND FOR ME
AND I ONLY WISH THERE WERE
SOMETHING I COULD DO FOR HER TO REPAY HER
ELPHABA SEE...
WE DESERVE EACHOTHER AND GALINDA HELPED IT COME TRUE
WE DESERVE EACHOTHER, ME AND LAFAYETE
Please, Elphaba, try to understand.
[HAMILTON] I do...
[linda]

 Now I must accessorize myself for Fiyero.
Shen Shen Pulls The Witch's Hat Out Of One Of Galinda's Hat Boxes.
Pfanee] Galinda, what in [Oz's name!?
[linda]

 Now, just pretend you didn't see that. My granny is always giving me the most hideodeous hats.
I'd give it away, but I don't hate anyone that much.
Shen Shen] Yes you do!
Pfanee] Give it to her! Just do it!
They All Stare At Elphaba. Galinda Walks Forward, Meeting Elphaba Half Way.
[HAMILTON] Galinda, listen, Nessa and I were talking about you just now...
[linda]

 And I was just talking about you! I thought you might want to wear this hat to the party tonight! Gives Her The Hat.
IT'S REALLY... UH... SHARP!
DON'T YOU THINK?
Y'KNOW BLACK, IS THIS YEAR'S PINK!
YOU DESERVE EACHOTHER,
THIS HAT AND YOU,
YOU'RE BOTH SO... SMART!
YOU DESERVE EACHOTHER, SO HERE!
OUT OF THE GOODNESS OF MY HEART!
Galinda Runs Off. Elphaba Laughs At The Sight Of The Hat. She Exits.. The Students Enter And Dance.
When This Is Done, LAFAYETE And Nessarose Appear, Awkwardly Holding Hands.
[Angelica]
 What's in the punch?
[Angelica]
 Lemons, and melons, and pears!
[Angelica]
 Oh my!
[Angelica]

LISTEN NESSA...
[Angelica]
 Yes?
[Angelica]

UH, NESSA...
I'VE GOT SOMETHING TO CONFESS A
REASON WHY, WELL, WHY I ASKED YOU HERE TONIGHT...
NOW, I KNOW IT ISN'T FAIR.
[Angelica]
 Oh, LAFAYETE, I know why.
[Angelica]
 You do?
[Angelica]

IT'S BECAUSE I'M IN THIS CHAIR, AND YOU FELT SORRY FOR ME...
WELL, ISN'T THAT RIGHT?
[Angelica]
 No... it's because... uh... because...
BECAUSE YOU ARE SO BEAUTIFUL!
[Angelica]
 Oh, LAFAYETE!
I THINK YOU'RE WONDERFUL!
AND WE DESERVE EACH OTHER, DON'T YOU SEE THIS IS OUR CHANCE?
WE DESERVE EACH OTHER, DON'T WE LAFAYETE?
[Angelica]
 You know what? Let's dance!
[Angelica]
 What?
[Angelica]

LET'S DANCE!
They Dance, As Well As The Others Around Them. Finally, Mme. Morrible Runs Up To Galinda.
[Morrible]
 Oh, Miss Upland?
[linda]

 Madame Morrible... What are you doing here?
[Morrible]
 I have something for you. She Hands Her A Small Wand.
[linda]

 Gasps. Madame... a training wand... How can I ever express my graditution?
[Morrible]
 Oh, don't thank me! This was your roommate's idea, not mine.
[linda]

 What? Elphaba?
[Morrible]
 Miss Elphaba requested that I include you in sorcery class. She insisted I tell you this very night or she would quit the seminar.
[linda]

 But... why?
[Morrible]
 I have no idea. My personal opinion is you do not have what it takes. I hope you'll prove me wrong... I doubt you will.
She Leaves. Fiyero Comes Up To Galinda.
[BURR]
 What is it?
[linda]

 I got what I wanted...
[BURR]
 Then what's the matter?
[linda]

 Nothing...
[BURR]
 Good. Let's dance...
They Begin To Dance As Elphaba Walks In. They Stop As All The Students Gasp And Make Comments About The Way She Is Dressed. People Then Start Laughing.
[BURR]
 Who in Ozis this?
[linda]

 My roommate... please, don't ... stare!
[BURR]
 How can you help it?
Elphaba Takes Off The Hat, Noticing The Comments. She Waits, Then Puts It Back On And Begins To Dance. She Is Alone. There Is No Music.
[BURR]
 Well I'll say this, she doesn't give a twig about what anyone else thinks.
[linda]

 Of course does, she just pretends not to... I feel awful...
[BURR]
 Why? It's not like it's your fault.
[linda]

 Excuse me... She Walks Over To Elphaba and Clears Her Throat. May I cut in?
Galinda Begins Dancing Just As Horribly. The Students Now Accept It, And Begin To Dance Again As The Music Starts.
All]
DANCING THROUGH LIFE, DOWN AT THE [OzDUST
IF ONLY BECAUSE DUST IS WHAT WE COME TO
AND THE STRANGE THING, YOUR LIFE COULD END UP CHANGING
WHILE YOU'RE DANCING THROUGH

[Scene 9 - Sharing Secrets]
Elphaba & Galinda Barge Into Their Suite... Galinda Is In Hysterics.
[linda]

 Your very first party ever?! Your very first party! Oh I know! Let's tell each other something we've never told anyone... I'll go first] Fiyero and I are going to be married (squeals).
[HAMILTON] Really? He's asked you already?
[linda]

 No, he doesn't know yet... Now, you tell me a secret.
[HAMILTON] Like what?
[linda]

 Like... Why do you always sleep with this funny, little, green bottle under your pillow? Grabs The Bottle.
[HAMILTON] Give that back.
[linda]

 C'mon, tell me. Tell me tell me!
[HAMILTON] It was my mother's! That's all...
Silence.
[linda]

 Hands Her The Bottle. It's not fair. I told you a really good one.
[HAMILTON] My father hates me.
[linda]

 Gasps.
[HAMILTON] No, that's not the secret. It's my fault...
[linda]

 What is?
[HAMILTON] ... that my sister is the way she is. . Pause. You see, when my mother was carrying Nessa, my father was worried that the new baby might come out...
Both] Green.
[HAMILTON] So he made my mother chew milk flowers, day and night. But that made Nessa come too soon, with her little legs all tangled. And my mother never woke up. None of which ever would have happened if not for me.
[linda]

 But that was the milkflowers fault, not yours. That may be your secret, Elphaba, but that doesn't make it true. She Oh look, it's tomorrow! Elphie... do you mind if I call you Elphie?
[HAMILTON] Well, it's a little perky.
[linda]

 And you can call me... Galinda. So... Elphie... now that we're friends, I've decided to make you my new project!
[HAMILTON] You really don't have to do that.
[linda]

 I know, that's what makes me so nice!

[linda]


WHENEVER I SEE SOMEONE LESS FORTUNATE THAN I

MY TENDER HEART TENDS TO START TO BLEED

WE'RE GONNA MAKE YOU POPULAR!
WHEN I SEE DEPRESSING CREATURES
WITH UNPREPOSSESSING FEATURES,
I REMIND THEM ON THEIR OWN BEHALF
TO THINK OF
CELEBRATED HEADS OF STATE

DID THEY HAVE BRAINS OR KNOWLEDGE?
DON'T MAKE ME LAUGH!
THEY WERE POPULAR
PLEASE, IT'S ALL ABOUT POPULAR
IT'S NOT ABOUT APTITUDE
IT'S THE WAY YOU'RE VIEWED
SO IT'S VERY SHREWD TO BE
VERY VERY POPULAR
LIKE ME!
[HAMILTON] This is never going to work!
[linda]

 Oh Elphie, you mustn't think that way anymore! Your whole life is going to change... and all because of me. Okay, stand... I will turn your frock into a beautiful ball gown! Stand up... She Picks Up Her Wand And Waves It. Ball gown!!! Nothing Happens, So She Repeats. Ball gown!!! Still Nothing Happens. She Taps Her Wand On The Bed. Is this thing on?
[HAMILTON] Do you want me to try?
[linda]

 No, I've got it! She Throws The Wand Down. Oh, just wear the frock... it's pretty! Now,
I'll show you how to flip your hair] Flip flip. Or you could use your hand. Demonstrates.
Or, you can use your whole body. Falls onto bed. Squeals. Now, for the finishing touch.
Takes flower out of her hair, puts it into Elphaba's. Why, Miss Elphaba, look at you, you're beautiful. Hands her the mirror.
[HAMILTON] After Looking In The Mirror. I... I have to go.
She Runs Off.
[linda]

 You're Welcome! She Admires Herself In The Mirror.
AND THOUGH YOU PROTEST
YOUR DISINTEREST,
I KNOW CLANDESTINELY...
YOU'RE GONNA GRIN AND BEAR IT
YOUR NEW FOUND POPULARITY! (SQUEALS)
LA LA LA LA
YOU'LL BE POPULAR!
JUST NOT QUITE AS POPULAR
AS ME!!!

[HAMILTON] Flips her hair.. Flip Flip! What?
[BURR]
 Nothing, it's just... you've been "Galinda-fied". You don't have to do that , you know?
[Hamilton]
 Alright, take your seats, class! I have something to say, and very little time to say it. This is my last day here at Shiz I am no longer permitted to teach. I want to thank you for your sharing your enthusiasm, your essays, no matter how feebly structured, and even, on occasion, your lunch.
Mme. Morrible Rushes In.
[Morrible]
 Doctor Dillamond! I'm so dreadfully sorry.
[HAMILTON] Madame, we've got to do something.
[Hamilton]
 Miss Elphaba, they can take away my job, but I shall continue speaking out.
Scientist] Come on, goat...
To Men Begin To Carry Him Out Of The Room.
[Hamilton]
 They are not telling you the whole story! Remember that, class! Remember that.
He Is Gone.
[HAMILTON] Doctor Dillamond! After A Pause. Well, are you just going to sit here in silence?
[Morrible]
 Miss Elphaba, there is nothing we can do. Please take your seat.
Professor] Good afternoon, students!
[Morrible]
 Good afternoon.
Professor] Every day, with every tick of the Time Dragon Clock, in every corner of our great [Oz, one hears the silence of progress. For example] this is called a cage!
He Points To A Cage With A Cloth Draped Over It. He Pulls Off The Cloth, Revealing A Lion Cub Inside.
Professor] Now, we will be seeing more and more of them in the near future. This remarkable innovation is actually for the Animal's own good...
[HAMILTON] If this is for his own good, then why is he trembling?
Professor] He's just excited to be here, that's all. Hits the cage. Now, as I was saying, one of the benefits of caging a Lion cub while he's young is that he never, in fact, will learn how to speak.
[HAMILTON] What?
He Motions The Students Forward, Toward The Cage.
Professor] That's right! Come closer!
[HAMILTON] To Fiyero. Can you imagine a world where Animals are kept in cages and they never speak?
Professor] Now, he may seem a bit agitated but that's easily remedied.
[HAMILTON] What should I do?
[BURR]
 I don't know.
[HAMILTON] Well, somebody has to... Do something!!!
Sparks Begin To Fly Everywhere. All Students & The Professor Are Moving Uncontrollably Except Fiyero and Elphaba.
[BURR]
 What's happening?
[HAMILTON] I don't know I got mad...andd
[BURR]
 Alright just don't move! And don't get mad at me... He Grabs The Cage. Well are you coming?
She Runs With Him After He Snatches The Lion Cub.
[HAMILTON] Careful! Don't shake him!
[BURR]
 I'm not!
[HAMILTON] We can't just let him loose anywhere, you know. We have to find someplace safe...
[BURR]
 Don't you think that I realize that? You must think I'm really stupid or something!
[HAMILTON] No, not really stupid.
[BURR]
 Why is it that every time I see you you're causing some sort of commotion?
[HAMILTON] I don't cause commotions, I am one.
[BURR]
 That's for sure.
[HAMILTON] Oh! So you think I should just keep my mouth shut! Is that what you're saying?
[BURR]
 No, I'm...
[HAMILTON] Do you think I want to be this way? Do you think I want to care this much? Don't you know how much easier my life would be if I didn't?
[BURR]
 Do you ever let anyone else talk?
[HAMILTON] Oh, sorry... But can I just say one more thing? You could have just walked away back there.
[BURR]
 So?
[HAMILTON] So, no matter how shallow and self-absorbed you tend to be...
[BURR]
 Excuse me, there's no pretense here. I happen to be genuinely self-absorbed and deeply shallow.
[HAMILTON] No you're not. Or you wouldn't be so unhappy.
[BURR]
 Fine, if you don't want my help...
[HAMILTON] No, I do! Poor little thing, it's heart is trembling... I didn't mean for...
[BURR]
 What did you mean to do? Why was I the only one you didn't do it to?
[HAMILTON] Oh look, you're bleeding... it must have scratched you. Referring To A Cut On His Face.
[BURR]
 Yea... or maybe it scratched me. I better get to safety... I mean the cub... get the cub to safety. He Walks Off.
[HAMILTON] Fiyero...

THAT'S THE GIRL HE CHOSE

WISHING ONLY WOUNDS THE HEART
I WASN'T BORN FOR THE ROSE AND PEARL
THERE'S A GIRL I KNOW
HE LOVES HER SO
I'M NOT THAT GIRL...

[[HAMILTON]
Miss Elphaba, there you are!
[HAMILTON] Madame Morrible...
[Morrible]
 Oh Miss Elphaba, I finally heard back from the Wizard!
[HAMILTON] The Wizard?
[Morrible]
 Yes, he wishes to meet you!
[HAMILTON] He asked for me?
[Morrible]
 Yes! I know how devastated you were the other day for our poor Doctor Dillamond, but I can assure you my dear, as one door closes, another one opens. She Hands Her A Green Envelope.
[HAMILTON] Madame, I don't know what to say! How can I ever thank you? She Hugs Her.
[Morrible]
 Oh careful dear, you musn't get wet She Places The Umbrella Back Over Elphaba's Head. Oh, I know! She Waves Her Hands And The Sun Comes Out. Didn't I tell you? Weather is my specialty. [Oz-speed, my dear! Make me proud.
[HAMILTON] I will, I'll try.
Morrible Exits.

[HAMILTON]
AND THERE WE'LL FINALLY BE
THE WIZARD AND I...

Conductor] All aboard!
[linda]

 Remember, eye contact. And don't forget to tell him how wonderful he is, Wizards love that! And be yourself... well... within reason.
LAFAYETE Wheels Nessarose Onstage.
[Angelica]
 Elphaba, I'm so proud of you and I know father would be too. We're all proud, aren't we?
[HAMILTON] You'll be alright, won't you?
[linda]

 She'll be fine! Biq will take care of her, right?
[Angelica]
 ...It's LAFAYETE... I... I can't do this anymore.
He Exits.
[Angelica]
 LAFAYETE...
[linda]

 Nessa, maybe he's just not the right one... for you.
[Angelica]
 No, it's me that's not right. Elphaba, just go, I'll be fine.
She Wheels Herself Offstage.
[HAMILTON] Nessa, wait!
[linda]

 Let her go. She'll have to manage without you. We all will.
[HAMILTON] Please, you'll barely even notice I'm gone. Besides, you have Fiyero. Where is he, anyway? Not that I expected him to say goodbye to me. We barely know each other.
[linda]

 I don't know him either. He's distant, and moodified, and he's been thinking, which really worrries me. I never knew how much he card about that old goat.
Fiyero Enters.
[linda]

 Oh, there he is! Fiyero, over here dearest!
[BURR]
 He Hands Elphaba Flowers. Elphaba, I'm happy for you.
[linda]

 Yes, we are both so happy...
[BURR]
 Uh, listen, I've been thinking...
[HAMILTON] Yes, I've heard.
[BURR]
 About that Lion cub and... everything. I think about that day a lot.
[HAMILTON] Really? So do I.
[linda]

 Me too! Poor Doctor Dillamond. It makes one want to... uh...
take a stand. So I've been thinking of... uh... changing my name.
[BURR]
 Your name?
[linda]

 Well, yes! Since Doctor Dillamond had his own way of pronouncing my name,
in solidarity and to express my outrage, I will henceforward be known no longer as Galinda, but as simply, Glinda.
[BURR]
 Oh well, that's very admirable of you... Glinda. To Elphaba. Elphaba, good luck.
He Runs Off.
[Burr] There, see?
[HAMILTON] Galinda...
[Burr] It's Glinda now. Stupid idea, I don't even know what made me say it.
[HAMILTON] It doesn't matter what your name is, everyone loves you!
[Burr] I don't care! I want him. I don't even think he's perfect anymore and I still want him.
This must be what other people feel like. How do they bear it? They embrace.

[HAMILTON] Come with me.
[Burr] Where?
[HAMILTON] To the Emerald City.
[Burr] Really?
[Ozia]

ONE SHORT DAY, IN THE EMERALD CITY...

A Large Head Is Rolled Onstage... It Speaks To The Two... Voice Booming
[Hamilton]
I am [Oz, the great and terrible! Who are you and why do you seek me?
[Burr] Say something!
[HAMILTON] Uh... Elphaba Thropp your terribleness!
His Speaks Normally.
[Hamilton]
Oh? Is that you Elphaba? I didn't realize!
He Climbs Out Of The Head.
[Hamilton]
I hope I didn't startle you, it's so hard to make out peoples' faces all the way back there.
So, let's see... which is which? Elphaba! He grabs her hands. And you must be.
[Burr] Glinda. The Ga is silent.
Elphaba touches the Ozmask.
[Hamilton]
I know. It isn't much, is it? But people expect this sort of thing. You have to give people what they want.
The thing is, I hardly ever let people meet the real me, but this being special occasion.
[HAMILTON] I'm so happy to meet you.
[Hamilton]
Well, that's good. 'Cause that's what I love best] making people happy!
I AM A SENTIMENTAL MAN
WHO ALWAYS LONGED TO BE A FATHER
THAT'S WHY I DO THE BEST I CAN
TO TREAT EACH CITIZEN OF OzAS SON
OR DAUGHTER
SO ELPHABA I'D LIKE TO RAISE YOU HIGH
'CUZ I THINK EVERYONE DESERVES THE CHANCE TO FLY!
AND HELPING YOU WITH YOUR ASCENT
ALLOWS ME TO FEEL SO PARENTAL.
FOR I AM
A SENTIMENTAL MAN!
[HAMILTON] I'm here... we're here to alert you that something bad is happening...
[Hamilton]
Please, I'm the Wizard of [Oz. I already know why you've come.
Elphaba & [Burr] Oooo.
[Hamilton]
Of course, you must prove yourself...
[Burr] Prove yourself, prove yourself.
[HAMILTON] But how?
[Hamilton]
Oh, I don't know.
SOME SORT OF GESTURE
MOSTLY FOR SHOW
SOMETHING TO TEST YOUR ADEPTNESS..
I know! Madame, the book!
Morrible Enters.
[Burr] Madame Morrible...
[Hamilton]
I believe you're well acquainted with my new Press Secretary.
[HAMILTON] Press Secretary?
[Morrible]
 Oh, yes dearies, I've risen up in the world. You'll find that the Wizard is a very generous man.
If you do something for him, he'll do much for you.
[HAMILTON] What do yhou want me to do?
[Hamilton]
Well, this is my monkey servent, Chistery. He looks so longingly at the birds every morning....
[Morrible]
 So the Wizard was thinking, perhaps, a levitation spell...
[Burr] Noticing A Book In Morrible's Hands. Is that the Grimmerie?
[Morrible]
 Yes, the ancient book of spells and enchantments. Hands It To Elphaba.
[Burr] Whispers. Can I touch it?
Morrlbe] Whispers. No!
[HAMILTON] What funny writing...
[Morrible]
 Well it's a lost language. The lost language of spells.
[Hamilton]
It's kind of a recipe book for change.
[Morrible]
 Don't be discouraged if you can't decipherate it, dearie.
I, myself, can only read a spell or two, and that took years and years
[HAMILTON]
AHVEN, TATEY, AVEN TATEY AVEN...
[Hamilton]
She Continues Chanting. Oh, Chistery, what a experience you are about to have!
[HAMILTON] .................................. AH MAY AH TAY ATUM
[Hamilton]
SINCE ONCE I HAVE MY OWN DAY IN THE SKY...
[HAMILTON] AH MAY AH TAH TAY MAY TU SE SAY TA!
[Hamilton]
I KNOW EVERYONE DESERVES THE CHANCE TO FLY!
Chistery Screams & Begins To Twitch.
[HAMILTON] What happened? Is something wrong?
[Morrible]
 No just a transition, dearie.
[HAMILTON] No, stop you're hurting him!
[Hamilton]
She's actually done it!
Chistery Sprouts Wings. And Begins Running Around The Stage.
[HAMILTON] NO! Quick, how do I reverse it?
[Morrible]
 You can't!
[HAMILTON] What?!
[Morrible]
 You can't! Spells are irreversible! I knew she had the power, I told you!
[HAMILTON] You planned all this?
[Morrible]
 Well, you benefit too, dearie! You benefit, too.
[Hamilton]
And this is only the beginning! Look.
The Other Monkeys Begin To Grow Wings And Fly.
[Morrible]
 Won't they make perfect spies?
[HAMILTON] Spies?!
[Hamilton]
You're right, that's a harsh word... how about scouts? That's what they'll be really. They'll fly around [Oz! Report any subversive Animal activity.
[HAMILTON] You can't read this book at all! Can you? That's why you need enemies, and cages, and spies. You have no real power.
[Hamilton]
Exactly... that's why I need you. Don't you see? The world is your oyster, now! You have so many...opportunites. You both do.
[Burr] Thank you, your [Ozness.
Wizard]
SINCE ONCE I HAD MY OWN DAY IN THE SKY
I KNOW EVERYONE DESERVES THE CHANCE TO...
[HAMILTON] NO!
She Runs Off.
[Morrible]
 Elphaba!
[Burr] Elphie! I am so sorry, your Wizardship. I'll fetch her back! Elphie wait!
She Runs After Her.
[Hamilton]
We must get her back. She knows too much.
[Morrible]
 Don't worry! I will handle it.
He Gets Back In The Head. Speaking, Again, With A Powerful Voice.
[Hamilton]
Guards, guards! There is a fugitive loose in the palace! Find her, capture her, and bring her to me!
Guards] Yes your [Ozness!

[Burr] Elphie, wait! Where are you going?
[HAMILTON] Oh no! There are no more stairs! This might be the attic...
[Burr] Elphaba, listen to me...
[HAMILTON] I have to barricade the door! She Picks Up A Broom And Places It Over A Trap Door.
[Burr] Elphaba, why couldn't you have stayed calm for once instead of flying off the handle?
I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY
I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY NOW
I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY HOW YOU'VE HURT YOUR CAUSE FOREVER
I HOPE YOU THINK YOU'RE CLEVER
[HAMILTON]
I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY! I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY TOO
I HOPE YOU'RE PROUD HOW YOU WOULD GROVEL IN SUBMISSION
TO FEED YOUR OWN AMBISSION
Both]
SO THOUGH I CAN'T IMAGINE HOW
I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY
RIGHT NOW...
[Morrible]
 Citizens of [Oz, there is an enemy that must be found and captured! Believe nothing she says. She's evil. Responsible for the mutilation of these poor, innocent monkeys! Her green skin is but an outward manifestation of her twisted nature! This distortion... this repulsion... this... Wicked Witch!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[Burr] Don't be afraid...
[HAMILTON] I'm not... it's the Wizard who should be afraid... of me!
[Burr] Elphie, just say you're sorry before it's too late.
YOU CAN STILL BE WITH THE WIZARD
WHAT YOU'VE WORKED AND WAITED FOR
YOU CAN HAVE ALL YOU EVER WANTED...
[HAMILTON] I know...
BUT I DON'T WANT IT
NO, I CAN'T WANT IT
ANYMORE...
SOMETHING HAS CHANGED WITHIN ME
SOMETHING IS NOT THE SAME
I'M THROUGH WITH PLAYING BY THE RULES
OF SOMEONE ELSE'S GAME!
TOO LATE FOR SECOND GUESSING
TOO LATE TO GO BACK TO SLEEP
IT'S TIME TO TRUST MY INSTINCTS
CLOSE MY EYES...
AND LEAP
IT'S TIME TO TRY DEFYING GRAVITY
I THINK I'LL TRY DEFYING GRAVITY
AND YOU CAN'T PULL ME DOWN
[Burr]
CAN'T I MAKE YOU UNDERSTAND
YOU'RE HAVING DELUSIONS OF GRANDURE?
[HAMILTON]
I'M THROUHG EXCEPTING LIMITS
'CUZ SOMEONE SAYS THEY'RE SO
SOME THINGS I CANNOT CHANGE,
BUT 'TIL I TRY I'LL NEVER KNOW!
TOO LONG I'VE BEEN AFRAID OF
LOSING LOVE I GUESS I'D LOST
WELL IF THAT'S LOVE,
IT COMES AT MUCH TOO HIGH A COST!
I'D SOONER BUY DEFYING GRAVITY
KISS ME GOODBYE I'M DEFYING GRAVITY
AND YOU CAN'T PULL ME DOWN!
The Guards Bang On The Locked Door.
[Guard]
 Open this door, in the name of his supreme [Ozness!
[HAMILTON] Ah May Ah Tay Ah Tum Ditum...
[Burr]
That's what started all this in the first place... that hideous levitation spell! STOP!!!
[Burr] Well... Where are your wings? Maybe you're not as powerful as you think you are...
A Broomstick Floats Across The Room Towards Elphaba.
[HAMILTON] I told you, Glinda... I did it, I tell ya!
The Guards Bang On The Door Once Again.
[HAMILTON] Quick! Get on!
[Burr] What?
[HAMILTON] Come with me... think of what we could do... together.
UNLIMITED, TOGETHER WE'RE UNLIMITED
TOGETHER WE'LL BE THE GREATEST TEAM THERE'S EVER BEEN, GLINDA

Well, are you coming?
[Burr] Elphie, you're trembling... here, put this around you...
She Drapes A Black Cape Around Her.
I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY
NOW THAT YOU'RE CHOOSING THIS
[HAMILTON] You too.
I HOPE IT BRINGS YOU BLISS
Both]
I REALLY HOPE YOU GET IT
AND YOU DON'T LIVE TO REGRET IT
I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY IN THE END!
I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY...
MY FRIEND...
Elphaba Runs Off. The Guards Break Down The Door.
[Guard]
 There she is! Don't let her get away!
They Grab Hold Of Glinda.
[Burr]
What in [Oz?! Let go of me! Do you hear me? Let go!
[HAMILTON]
It's not her. She has nothing to do with. I'm the one you want. It's me. Hahahahaha. It's me! Up here! It's me!
She Rises Up Center Stage Holding Her Broom.
[HAMILTON]
SO IF YOU CARE TO FIND ME,
LOOK TO THE WESTERN SKY
AS SOMEONE TOLD ME LATELY,
EVERYONE DESERVES THE CHANCE TO FLY!
AND IF I'M FLYING SOLO,
AT LEAST I'M FLYING FREE!

[BURR]
 Not really, but I don't like to think of her as a Wicked Witch.
[Morrible]
 Captain, how does it feel?
[BURR]
 Frustrating... but I became captain of the guard to find her, and I will keep searching!

[BURR]
 That's not how you described it to me.
[Burr] Oh no, not exactly, but Whispers we'll talk about it later.
[Morrible]

THEN WITH A JEALOUS SQUEEE
THE WICKED WITCH BURST FROM CONCEALMENT
WHERE SHE HAD BEEN LURKING
SURREPTITIALLY!
Gasps From Among The Crowd.
[Ozian]
I HEAR SHE HAS AN EXTRA EYE THAT ALWAYS REMAINS AWAKE!
[Ozian]
I HEAR THAT SHE CAN SHED HER SKIN AS EASILY AS A SNAKE!
[Ozian]
I HEAR SOME REBEL ANIMALS ARE GIVING HER FOOD AND SHELTER!
[Ozian]
I HEAR HER SOUL IS SO UNCLEAN, PURE WATER CAN MELT HER!
[BURR]
 What?
[Ozia]

MELT HER! PLEASE SOMEBODY GO AND MELT HER!
[BURR]
 Do you hear that?! Water will melt her? People are so empty-headed they'll believe anything!
[Burr] Excuse me just a tick-tock!
Her And Fiyero Talk Aside.
[BURR]
 I can't just stand here grinning pretending to go along with all of this!
[Burr] Do you think I like to hear them say those awful things about her? I hate it!
[BURR]
 Then what are we doing here? Let's go, let's get out of here!
[Burr] We can't leave now, not when people are looking to us to raise their spirits.
[BURR]
 You can't leave, because you can't resist this. And that is the truth.
[Burr] Maybe I can't. Is that so wrong? Who could?
[BURR]
 You know who could. Who has.
[Burr] Fiyero, I miss her too, but we can't just stop living. No one has searched harder for her than you. But don't you see? She doesn't want to be found. We have to face it.
[BURR]
 You're right. I'm sorry, you're right. And if it's going tol make you happy, of course I'll marry you.
[Burr] But it'll make you happy too, right?
[BURR]
 You know me... I'm always happy. He Runs Off.
[Burr] Fiyero! Thanks plenty dearest! He's gone to fetch me a refreshment, he's so thoughtful that way!
THAT'S WHY I COULDN'T BE HAPPIER
NO, I COULDN'T BE HAPPIER
THOUGH IT IS I ADMIT, THE TINIEST BIT
UNLIKE I ANTICIPATED,
BUT I COULDN'T BE HAPPIER
SIMPLY COULDN'T BE HAPPIER...
Well, not simply...
'CUZ GETTING YOUR DREAMS, IT'S STRANGE BUT IT SEEMS
A LITTLE, WELL, COMPLICATED...
THERE'S A KIND OF A SORT OF COST
THERE'S A COUPLE OF THINGS GET LOST...
THERE ARE BRIDGES YOU CROSSED YOU DIDN'T KNOW YOU CROSSED UNTIL YOU'VE CROSSED!
AND IF THAT JOY THAT THRILL
DOESN'T THRILL LIKE YOU THINK IT WILL...
STILL... WITH THIS PERFECT FINALE
THE CHEERS AND THE BALLYHOO
WHO WOULDN'T BE HAPPIER?
SO I COULDN'T BE HAPPIER
BECAUSE HAPPY IS WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN ALL YOUR DREAMS COME TRUE...
WELL, ISN'T IT?
HAPPY IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOUR DREAMS COME...
TRUE!!!!
[Ozia]

WE LOVE YOU GLINDA IF WE MAY BE SO FRANK!
[Burr]
THANK GOODNESS!
[Ozia]

FOR ALL THIS JOY WE KNOW WHO WE'VE GOT TO THANK!
THANK GOODNESS!
THAT MEANS THE WIZARD, GLINDA...
[Burr]
AND FIANCE!
[Ozia]

THEY COULDN'T BE GOODLIER
SHE COULDN'T BE LOVLIER
WE COULDN'T BE LUCKIER!
[Burr] I COULDN'T BE HAPPIER!!!
[Ozia]
 THANK GOODNESS!!!
[Burr] TODAY!!!!
[Ozia]
 TODAY, THANK GOODNESS FOR TODAY!


[Angelica]
 Will there be anything else, Madame?
[Angelica]
 I've asked you to call me Nessarose, remember?
[Angelica]
 Yes, Madame. He Exits.
[Angelica]
 LAFAYETE...
Elphaba's Voice Is Heard Inside A Closet.
[HAMILTON] Well, it seems the beautiful only get more beautiful, Nessarose Screams while the green just get greener.
Nessarose Is Scared And Confused.
Elphaba Steps Out Of The Closet.
[HAMILTON] I'm sorry. Did I scare you? I seem to have that effect on people. It's good to see you.
[Angelica]
 What are you doing here?
[HAMILTON] Well, there's no place like home. I never thought I'd hear myself say this but I need father's help. I need him to stand with me.
[Angelica]
 That's impossible.
[HAMILTON] No, no it's not. Not if you ask him. You know he'll listen to you.
[Angelica]
 Father's dead.
[HAMILTON] What?
[Angelica]
 He's dead. I'm the governor... Well what did you expect? After he learned what you'd done,
how you'd disgraced u,s he died... of shame. Embarrassed to death.
[HAMILTON] Good, I'm glad. It's better that way.
[Angelica]
 That's a wicked thing to say.
[HAMILTON] No, it's true. Because now it's just us. You can help me and together we can...
[Angelica]
 Elphaba, shut up! First of all, I can't harbor a fugitive, I'm an un-elected official!
And why should I help you? You fly around [Oz, trying to rescue animals you've never even met,
and not once have you ever thought to use your powers to rescue me!
ALL OF MY LIFE, I'VE DEPENDED ON YOU
HOW DO YOU THINK THAT FEELS?
ALL OF MY LIFE I'VE DEPENDED ON YOU
AND THIS HIDEOUS CHAIR WITH WHEELS!
SCROUNGING FOR SCRAPS OF PITY TO PICK UP
AND LONGING TO KICK UP
MY HEELS...
[HAMILTON] Nessa, there isn't a spell for everything! The power is mysterious.
It's not like coddling up a pair of... She Pulls Out The Grimmerie From Her Bag. Wait.
[Angelica]
 What are you doing?
Elphaba Begins Chanting.
[Angelica]
 What is that? Ah! My shoes! It feels like... like they're on fire! What have you done to my shoes???
She Lifts Her Dress, Revealing The Ruby Slippers. Nessarose Stands, But Falls. Elphaba Gives Her A Hand.
[Angelica]
 No, don't help me. She Stands.
[HAMILTON] Oh, Nessa, at last...
I'VE DONE WHAT LONG AGO I SHOULD
AND FINALLY FROM THESE POWERS SOMETHING GOOD
FINALLY SOMETHING GOOD...
[Angelica]
 LAFAYETE! LAFAYETE! Come quickly!
[HAMILTON] LAFAYETE?
[Angelica]
 LAFAYETE! Come here at once!
[HAMILTON] No! Nessa, listen, nobody can know I'm here!
Nessarose Runs Behind The Closet As LAFAYETE Enters.
[Angelica]
 Yes, what is it, Madame?
[HAMILTON] LAFAYETE...
[Angelica]
 What are you doing here? You stay back!
[HAMILTON] LAFAYETE, it's just me, I'm not going to hurt you!
[Angelica]
 No! You're lying! That's all you ever do! You and your sister! She's as wicked as you are!
[HAMILTON] What are you talking about?
[Angelica]
 I'm talking about my life. The little that's left of it. I'm not free to leave Munchkinland, none of us are.
Ever since she took power, she's been stripping the Munchkins of our rights...
and we didn't have that many to begin with! And do you know why?
Nessarose Reveals Herself In The Chair.
[Angelica]
 To keep you here, with me. But none of that matters anymore. Look.
Nessarose Stands Up.
[Angelica]
 To Elphaba. You did this for her?
[Angelica]
 For both of us!
[Angelica]
 Nessa, this changes everything.
[Angelica]
 I know.
[Angelica]

LISTEN NESSA...
[Angelica]
 What?
[Angelica]

UH NESSA, SURELY NOW I'LL MATTER LESS TO YOU
AND YOU WON'T MIND MY LEAVING HERE TONIGHT...
[Angelica]
 Leaving?
[Angelica]
 Yes...
THAT BALL THAT'S BEING STAGED
ANNOUNCING GLINDA IS ENGAGED
[Angelica]
 Glinda?
[Angelica]

YES NESSA THAT'S RIGHT!
I'VE GOT TO GO APPEAL TO HER
EXPRESS THE WAY I FEEL TO HER
Oh, Nessa, I lost my heart to Glinda from the moment I first saw her. You know that.
[Angelica]
 Lost your heart? Well, we'll see about that...
[HAMILTON] Nessa, let him go...
[Angelica]

DID YOU THINK I'D LET YOU LEAVE ME HERE FLAT?
[Angelica]
 Don't come any closer!
YOU'RE GOING TO LOSE YOUR HEART TO ME, I TELL YOU!
IF I HAVE TO... I HAVE TO...
Sees The Grimmerie.
MAGIC SPELL YOU...
She Grabs The Book.
[Angelica]
 Ah... Tum... Tah... Tae...
Elphaba Reveals Herself.
[HAMILTON] Nessa, stop!
[Angelica]
 What is she doing?!
[HAMILTON] No, Nessa, you're pronouncing the words all wrong!
[HAMILTON] Nessa!
[Angelica]
 LAFAYETE! What is it?
[Angelica]
 Gasps. My heart feels like it's... shrinking.
[Angelica]
 Elphaba, do something!
[HAMILTON] I can't! You can't reverse a spell once it's been cast!
[Angelica]
 So what do we do?
LAFAYETE Falls Into Nessa's Empty Wheel Chair. Elphaba Wheels Him Behind The Closet.
[Angelica]
 Elphaba, do something!
[Angelica]
 This is all your fault! If you hadn't shown me that horrendible book.
[HAMILTON] I have to find another spell... it's the only thing that might work. She Goes Behind The Closet As Well.
[Angelica]
 Save him, please!
JUST SAVE HIM, MY POOR LAFAYETE, MY SWEET MY BRAVE,
DON'T LEAVE ME 'TIL MY SORRY LIFE HAS CEASED...
Elphaba Wheels The Chair Out, Which Is Not Facing The Audience And Is Seen Casting A Spell.
ALL ALONE AND LOVELESS HERE
JUST THE GIRL IN THE MIRROR
JUST HER AND ME! THE WICKED WITCH OF THE EAST!
WE DESERVE EACH OTHER...
[Angelica]
 Well... what about his heart?
[HAMILTON] It's all right. He won't need one now. I have to go. I have business to attend to in the Emerald City.
Nessa, I have done everything I could for you but it has never been enough and it never will be...
She Leaves.
[Angelica]
 Elphaba, wait! Elphaba!
LAFAYETE Wakes Up.
[Angelica]
 Where am I? What happened?
[Angelica]
 Nothing, LAFAYETE, you just fell asleep... and...
He Sits Up, Squeaking. He Is Made Of Tin. Nessarose Screams.
[Angelica]
 What is it, what's wrong?
[Angelica]
 No, it wasn't me it was her! I tried to stop her.
LAFAYETE Screams Uncontrollably And Runs Off.
[Angelica]
 LAFAYETE, please listen! It was Elphaba! LAFAYETE! It was Elphaba!!!

[Hamilton]
[HAMILTON] Well you have, you have harmed me.
[Hamilton]
I realize that, and I regret it. Elphaba...
[HAMILTON] There you are! I'm setting those monkeys free! And don't try to interfere, or call the guards...
[Hamilton]
I'm not calling anyone. The truth is I'm glad to see you again. It gets pretty lonely around here. And I know you must get lonely too.
[HAMILTON] You don't know the first thing about me.
[Hamilton]
Oh, but I do. I do know you. I can't explain it exactly. You know what I mean? Elphaba, you've been so strong through all of this, aren't you tired of being the strong one? Wouldn't you like someone to take care of you? He Hands Her Back The Broom. Please, help me start again.
[HAMILTON] Don't you think I wish I could? That I could go back to the time when I believed you really were wonderful? The Wonderful Wizard of [Oz? Nobody believed in you more than I did.
[Hamilton]
Oh, my dear child...
I NEVER ASKED FOR THIS OR PLANNED IT IN ADVANCE
I WAS MERELY BLOWN HERE BY THE WINDS OF CHANCE
I NEVER SAW MYSELF AS A SOLOMON OR SOCRATES
I KNEW WHO I WAS, ONE OF YOUR DIME A D[OzEN MEDIOCRATES
THEN SUDDENLY I'M HERE, RESPECTED, WORSHIPED EVEN
JUST BECAUSE THE FOLKS IN OzNEEDED SOMEONE TO BELIEVE IN
DOES IT SURPRISE YOU I GOT HOOKED AND ALL TOO SOON
WHAT CAN I SAY? I GOT CARRIED AWAY
AND NOT JUST BY BALLOON...
WONDERFUL
THEY CALLED ME WONDERFUL
SO I SAID, WONDERFUL, IF YOU INSIST
I WILL BE WONDERFUL
AND THEY SAID WONDERFUL
BELIEVE ME IT'S HARD TO RESIST
'CUZ IT FEELS WONDERFUL
THEY THINK I'M WONDERFUL
HEY LOOK WHO'S WONDERFUL
THIS CORN-FED HICK!
WHO SAID IT MIGHT BE KEEN
TO BUILD A TOWN OF GREEN
AND A WONDERFUL ROAD OF YELLOW BRICK!
See, I never had a family of my own since I was always traveling, and I guess I just wanted to give the citizens of Ozeverything.
[HAMILTON] So you lied to them?
[Hamilton]
Only verbally. Besides, they were the lies they wanted to hear. Elphaba, where I come from we believe all sorts of things that aren't true... we call it history!
A MAN'S CALLED A TRAITOR
OR LIBERATOR
A RICH MAN'S A THIEF
OR PHILANTHROPIST
IS ONE A CRUSADER
OR RUTHLESS INVADER
IT'S ALL IN THE LABEL WHICH IS ABLE TO PERSIST
THERE ARE PRECIOUS FEW AT EASE
WITH MORAL AMBIGUITIES
SO WE ACT AS THOUGH THEY DON'T EXIST...
THEY CALL ME WONDERFUL
SO I AM
INFACT, IT'S SO MUCH WHO I AM IT'S PART OF MY NAME!
AND WITH MY HELP YOU CAN BE THE SAME...
AT LONG, LONG LAST RECEIVE YOUR DUE
LONG OVERDUE
ELPHABA, THE MOST CELEBRATED
ARE THE REHABILITATED
THERE'LL SUCH A WHOOPDEE DOO!
A CELEBRATION THROUGHOUT [Oz,
THAT'S ALL TO DO WITH YOU!
WONDERFUL, THEY'LL CALL YOU WONDERFUL!
[HAMILTON]
THAT DOES SOUND WONDERFUL!
Wizard]
TRUST ME IT'S FUN!!!
Both]
WHEN YOU ARE WONDERFUL,
IT WOULD BE WONDERFUL!
WONDERFUL, WONDERFUL
Wizard]
ONE, TWO AND...
They Dance.
[HAMILTON]
I'LL ACCEPT YOUR PROPOSITION
[Hamilton]
Wonderful
[HAMILTON]
ON ONE CONDITION
[Hamilton]
Yes?
[HAMILTON] You set those Monkeys free.
[Hamilton]
Done.

[HAMILTON] Go! Fly! You're Free! Fly! Chistery, Chistery, you're free, isn't it wonderful?! Go, fly! She Makes Her Way To Another "Monkey" Covered By A Sheet.
[Hamilton]
No! No! Please!
She Pulls Off The Cover, Revealing Dr. Dillamond.
[HAMILTON] No! It can't be! Doctor Dillamond...
[Hamilton]
Elphaba, we just couldn't keep letting him speak out...
[HAMILTON] Doctor Dillamond, are you alright? Don't be afraid. It's me, Elphaba.
[Hamilton]
 Bahhhhh.
[HAMILTON] Doctor, don't you remember me?
[Hamilton]
 Bahhhhh.
[HAMILTON] Can't you speak?
[Hamilton]
 Bahhhhh.
[HAMILTON] No... We have nothing in common. I am nothing like you and I never will be and I will fight you until the day I die!!!
The Wizard Climbs Into The Head And Dr. Dillamond Runs Offstage.

[Hamilton]
Guards, guards!!!
Fiyero Runs In With His Men.
[Guard]
 Halt!
[BURR]
 Are you alright, your [Ozness?
[HAMILTON] Fiyero!
[BURR]
 I don't believe it...
[HAMILTON] Oh , Fiyero, thank God. I thought you were...
[BURR]
 Silence witch!!!
[Guard]
 There's a Goat on the lam, sir.
[BURR]
 Never mind all that. Fetch me some... some water.
[Guard]
 Water, sir?
[BURR]
 You heard me, as much as you can carry.
Guards] Yes, sir!
They March Off.
[HAMILTON] Fiyero...
[BURR]
 I said silence!
[Hamilton]
He Runs Out Of The Head. No! No!
[BURR]
 Don't make a sound, your [Ozness, unless you want all your guests to know the truth about the Wonderful Wizard of [Oz... Elphaba, I'll find Doctor Dillamond later, no get out of here.
[HAMILTON] Fiyero, you frightened me. I thought, I though you might have changed.
[BURR]
 I have... changed.
Glinda Enters.
[Burr] What's going on... Elphie? Oh, thank Ozyou're alive! Only you shouldn't have come. If anyone discoverates you ...
[BURR]
 Glinda, you'd better go.
[Burr] Fiyero, what are you...
[BURR]
 Please, just go back to the ball.
[Burr] Your [Ozness, he means no disrespectation. Please understand! You see, we all went to school together...
[BURR]
 Elphaba!
[Burr] Fiyero, have you misplaced your mind? What are you doing?
[BURR]
 I'm going with her.
[Burr] What? What are you saying? You mean all this time... the two of you... behind my back...
[HAMILTON] No, Glinda it wasn't like that!
[BURR]
 Actually, it was...but it wasn't...Elphaba, let's go... let's go!
They Run Off.
[Burr] Fine, go! You deserve each other...
The Wizard Holds A Small Bottle With A Green Liquid.
[Hamilton]
Here, have a swig of this, it dulls the pain.
[Burr] No, thank you.
Mme. Morrible Enters, Laughing.
[Morrible]
 Oh, is it true? Your betrothed has taken her into custody?
[Hamilton]
Our new captain of the guard had other plans.
[Morrible]
 You mean she hasn't been captured?
[Hamilton]
Quite the contrary. And considering how well she eluded us last time...
[Morrible]
 Well, we'll just flush her out and force her to show herself.
[Hamilton]
But how?
[Burr] Her sister
[Morrible]
 What? What did she say?
[Burr] Use her sister. Spread a rumor. Make her think her sister is in trouble and she will fly to her side... and you'll have her.
[Hamilton]
Exactly so.
[Burr] Now, if your [Ozness will excuse me I have a slight headache, I think I'll lie down.
She Walks Out.
[Morrible]
 Yes, well...a rumor won't do it. Elphaba's too smart for that.
[Hamilton]
Far too smart.
[Morrible]
 Perhaps, a change in the weather...

[Burr]
DON'T WISH, DON'T START
WISHING ONLY WOUNDS THE HEART...
THERE'S A GIRL I KNOW, HE LOVES HER SO...
I'M NOT THAT GIRL...

Only Elphaba & Fiyero Are On Stage, In The Woods
[HAMILTON]
KISS ME TOO FIERCELY, HOLD ME TOO TIGHT
I NEED HELP BELIEVING YOU'RE WITH ME TONIGHT
MY WILDEST DREAMINGS COULD NOT FORSEE
LYING BESIDE YOU WITH YOU WANTING ME
IF JUST FOR THIS MOMENT
AS LONG AS YOU'RE MINE
I'VE LOST ALL RESISTANCE
AND CROSSED SOME BORDERLINE
AND IF IT TURNS OUT
IT'S OVER TOO FAST
I'LL MAKE EVERY LAST MOMENT LAST
AS LONG AS YOU'RE MINE...
[BURR]

MAYBE I'M BRAINLESS, MAYBE I'M WISE,
BUT YOU'VE GOT ME SEEING THROUGH DIFFERENT EYES,
SOMEHOW I'VE FALLEN UNDER YOUR SPELL
AND SOMEHOW I'M FEELING
IT'S UP THAT I FELL
Both]
EVERY MOMENT, AS LONG AS YOU'RE MINE
I'LL WAKE UP MY BODY
AND MAKE UP FOR LOST TIME
[BURR]

SAY THERE'S NO FUTURE
FOR US AS A PAIR...
Both]
AND THOUGH I MAY KNOW,
I DON'T CARE
IF JUST FOR THIS MOMENT
AS LONG AS YOU'RE MINE
COME BE HOW YOU WANT TO
AND SEE HOW BRIGHT WE SHINE!
BORROW THE MOONLIGHT
UNTIL IT IS THROUGH
AND KNOW I'LL BE HERE HOLDING YOU...
AS LONG AS YOU'RE MINE...
[BURR]
 What is it?
[HAMILTON] It's just... for the first time... I feel... wicked.

[HAMILTON] I just wish...
[BURR]
 What?
[HAMILTON] I wish I could be beautiful... for you.
[BURR]
 Elphaba...
[HAMILTON] Don't tell me that I am, you don't need to lie to me.
[BURR]
 It's not lying! It's... uh... it's looking at things another way. Someday, you and Glinda will make up and we'll all...
[HAMILTON] Shh! Listen... Do you hear that? A Shriek Is Heard In The Distance. It sounds like somebody in pain.
[BURR]
 It's just the wind.
[HAMILTON] The Siren Is Heard Again. My sister's in danger.
[BURR]
 What? How do you know?
[HAMILTON] I don't know, I just do... Gasps.
[BURR]
 Elphaba what's wrong, what is it?
[HAMILTON] This! Don't you see it?
[BURR]
 What do you mean? What do you see?
[HAMILTON] It doesn't make any sense... It's a house but it's... it's flying through the sky? I have to go to Nessa!
[BURR]
 I'll come with you!
[HAMILTON] No, you mustn't, it's too dangerous!
[BURR]
 Listen to me, listen! My family has a castle in Kiamo Ko. Now, no one is ever there except for the sentries who watch over it. We've never lived there.
[HAMILTON] Where do you live?
[BURR]
 In the other castle... It's the perfect hiding place; tunnels, secret passageways. You'll be safe there.
[HAMILTON] We will see each other again, won't we?
[BURR]
 Elphaba, we are going to be together always. You can see houses flying through the sky, can't you see that?
They Embrace And Elphaba Runs Off.
Glinda Enters. There Is A House In The Background. The Edge OF The Yellow Brick Road Can Be Seen.
[Burr] That's right, you just take that one road, the whole time. Waves offstage. Oh, I hope they don't get lost. I'm so bad at giving directions. She sees the house, picks up flowers and lays them in front of the house. Oh, Nessa.
Elphaba Appears.
[HAMILTON] What a touching display of grief.
[Burr] I don't think we have anything further to say to one another.
[HAMILTON] I wanted something to remember her by, and all that is left were those shoes, and now that wretched little farm girl has walked off with them. So I'd appreciate some time, alone, to say goodbye to my sister.
Glinda Backs Away As Elphaba Walks Toward The House.
[HAMILTON] Nessa, please, please, please forgive me...
[Burr] Elphie... you mustn't blame yourself. It's dreadful, it is, to have a house fall on you, but accidents will happen.
[HAMILTON] You call this an accident?
[Burr] Yes! Well, maybe not an accident...
[HAMILTON] Well, what do you call it?
[Burr] Well... a regime change. Caused by a bizarre and unexpected twister of fate.
[HAMILTON] You think cyclones just appear out of the blue?
[Burr] I don't know, I never really...
[HAMILTON] No, of course you never! You're too busy telling everyone how wonderful everything is!
[Burr] I'm a public figure, now. People expect me to...
[HAMILTON] Lie?
[Burr] Be encouraging! And what exactly have you been doing besides riding around on that filthy, old thing?
[HAMILTON] Well, we can't all come and go by bubble. Who's invention was that, the Wizard's? Of course, even if it wasn't I'm sure he'd still take credit for it.
[Burr] Yes, well, a lot of us are taking things that don't belong to us, aren't we?
[HAMILTON] Now wait just a clock tick! I know it may be difficult for that blissful, blonde brain of yours to comprehend that someone like him could actually choose someone like me! But it's happened... it's real. And you can wave that ridiculous wand all you want, you can't change it! He never belonged to you, he doesn't love you, and he never did! He loves me!
Glinda Slaps Her.
[HAMILTON] Cackles. Feel better now?
[Burr] Yes, I do.
[HAMILTON] Good, so do I.
She Slaps Glinda. Glinda Then Twirls Her Wand Skillfully And Elphaba Arms Herself With Her Broom. They Charge At Each Other And Then Drop Their "Weapons" And Beat Each Other Senselessly. Glinda Takes Elphaba's Hat Off Her Head And Begins To Whack Her With It. The Guards Run In.
[Guard]
 Halt! In the name of the Wizard!
They Grab Elphaba.
[HAMILTON] Stop! Let me go!
[Burr] Let me go, I almost had her!
[Guard]
 Sorry it took us so long to get here, Miss.
[HAMILTON] I can't believe you would sink this low! To use my sister's death as a trap to capture me?!
[Burr] I never meant for this to happen! Elphie!
Fiyero Swings In On A Rope.
[BURR]
 Let the green girl go!
[Burr] Fiyero, how in [Oz?
[BURR]
 I said let her go! Or explain to all Ozhow the Wizard's guards watched while Glinda the Good was slain.
[Burr] Fiyero...
[BURR]
 I said, let her go.
The Guards Release Her.
[BURR]
 Elphaba, go, now.
[HAMILTON] No, not without you.
[Burr] Fiyero, please.
[BURR]
 Hush! Now! Go!
Elphaba Hesitates.
[Burr] Do it!
She Runs Off.
[Guard]
 Seize him!
[Burr] Wait, what?! What are you doing? Stop it! In the name of goodness, stop! Don't you see? He wasn't going to harm me, he just... he just... he loves her.
[BURR]
 Glinda, I'm so sorry!
[Guard]
 Take him up to that field there! Put him on one of those poles until he tells us where the witch went.
They Drag Him Offstage.
[Burr] No, don't hurt him! Please, don't hurt him! Fiyero!!!!
[HAMILTON] Fiyero!!!!
ELEKA NAHMEN NAHMEN ATUM ATUM ELEKA NAHMEN
ELEKA NAHMEN NAHMEN ATUM ATUM ELEKA NAHMEN
LET HIS FLESH NOT BE TORN LET HIS BLOOD LEAVE NO STAIN,
WILL THEY BEAT HIM, LET HIM FEEL NO PAIN...
LET HIS BONES NEVER BREAK AND HOWEVER THEY TRY TO DESTROY HIM,
LET HIM NEVER DIE, LET HIM NEVER DIE!
ELEKA NAHMEN NAHMEN ATUM ATUM ELEKA NAHMEN
ELEKA NAHMEN NAHMEN ATUM ATUM ELEKA... ELEKA
AH! WHAT GOOD IS THIS CHANTING?
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT I'M READING
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT TRICK I OUGHT TO TRY!
FIYERO WHERE ARE YOU?! ALREADY DEAD OR BLEEDING?
ONE MORE DISASTER I CAN ADD TO MY GENEROUS SUPPLY!
NO GOOD DEED GOES UNPUNISHED
NO ACT OF CHARITY GOES UNRESENTED
NO GOOD DEED GOES UNPUNISHED
THAT'S MY NEW CREED
MY ROAD OF GOOD INTENTIONS
LED WHERE SUCH ROADS ALWAYS LEAD
NO GOOD DEED
GOES UNPUNISHED!
NESSA...
DOCTOR DILLAMOND...
FIYERO...
FIYERO!!!
ONE QUESTION HAUNTS AND HURTS
TOO MUCH, TOO MUCH TO MENTION
WAS I REALLY SEEKING GOOD
OR JUST SEEKING ATTENTION?
IS THAT ALL GOOD DEEDS ARE WHEN LOOKED AT WITH AN ICE COLD EYE?
IF THAT'S ALL GOOD DEEDS ARE
MAYBE THAT'S THE REASON WHY
NO GOOD DEED GOES UNPUNISHED
ALL HELPFUL URGES SHOULD BE CIRCUMVENTED
NO GOOD DEED GOES UNPUNISHED
SURE, I MEANT WELL, WELL LOOK AT WHAT WELL MEANT DID!
ALRIGHT, ENOUGH, SO BE IT!
SO BE IT THEN...
LET ALL OF OzBE AGREED
I'M WICKED THROUGH AND THROUGH
SINCE I COULD NOT SUCCEED
FIYERO SAVING YOU
I PROMISE NO GOOD DEED WILL I ATTEMPT TO DO AGAIN
EVER AGAIN!
NO GOOD DEAD, WILL I DO
AGAIN!!!!!!!!

[Ozia]

GO! AND HUNT HER AND FIND HER AND KILL HER!
Vicious Woman] Good fortune, witch hunters!

[Ozia]

GO! AND HUNT HER AND FIND HER AND KILL HER!
Rabid Man] Kill the witch!
[Ozia]

WICKEDNESS MUST BE PUNISHED
EVIL EFFECTIVELY ELIMINATED
WICKEDNESS MUST BE PUNISHED
KILL THE WITCH!
[Angelica]
 And, this is more than just a service to the Wizard. I have a personal score to settle with Elph... with the witch! Crowd Cheers.
IT'S DUE TO HER I'M MADE OF TIN
HER SPELL MADE THIS OCCUR
SO FOR ONCE I'M GLAD I'M HEARTLESS
I'LL BE HEARTLESS KILLING HER!
And I am not the only one. Looks Offstage. Oh, come on, you! Come out and tell them what she did to you in class that day. How you were just a cub and she cubnapped you.
Lion] No!
[Angelica]

YOU SEE THE LION ALSO
HAS A GRIEVANCE TO REPAY (Lion Roars)
IF SHE'D LET HIM FIGHT HIS OWN BATTLES WHEN HE WAS YOUNG,
HE WOULDN'T BE A COWARD TODAY!

[Burr] No, no, that's not the way it happened! Madame, you've got to stop this, it's gone too far!
[Morrible]
 Oh, I think Elphaba can take care of herself.
[Burr] Madame, something's been troubling me about Nessarose and that cyclone.
[Morrible]
 Oh yes... well, I guess it was just her time.
[Burr] Was it? Or did you...
[Morrible]
 After A Pause. Now, you listen to me, Missy, you may have fooled the rest of Ozwith this "aren't I good" routine, but you know better. You've wanted this since the beginning... and now you're getting what you wanted. So just smile and wave and shut up! Good fortune, good fortune witch hunters!
Rapid Man] Kill her!
Vicious Woman] Kill the witch!
WICKEDNESS MUST BE PUNISHED
BRAVE WITCH HUNTERS I WOULD JOIN YOU IF I COULD
BECAUSE WICKEDNESS MUST BE PUNISHED...
PUNISHED... PUNISHED...
BUT GOOD!!!
[HAMILTON] Oh, for [Oz's sake, stop crying!!! I can't listen to it anymore! Oh, you want to see your Aunt Em and your Uncle What's-his-name again?! Then get those shoes off your feet!!! Little brat... takes a dead woman's shoes; must have been raised in a barn! Chistery! Oh, Chistery, there you are. Where are the others? Chistery motions away. Chistery, please... if you don't at least try to keep speaking you will never... She Sees Glinda. Go away.
[Burr] They're coming for you.
[HAMILTON] Go away!
[Burr] Let the little girl go, and that poor little dog... Dodo.
[Burr] I know you don't want to hear this, but someone has to say it... You are out of control! I mean, come on! They're just shoes, let it go! Elphaba, you can't go on like this.
[HAMILTON] I can do anything I want. I am the Wicked Witch of the West! Another monkey Brings Her A Letter. At last! What took you so long? She Reads It. What's this? Why are you bothering me with this? She Reads On.
[Burr] What is it? What's wrong? It's Fiyero, isn't it? Is he...
[HAMILTON] We've seen his face for the last time.
[Burr] Oh no!
[HAMILTON] You're right... It's time I surrender. Carries A Bucket.
[Burr] Elphie.... Elphie, what is it?
[HAMILTON] You can't be found here! You must go. Refers To A Corner
[Burr] No.
[HAMILTON] You must leave.
[Burr] No! Elphie, I'll tell them everything.
[HAMILTON] No! They'll only turn against you.
[Burr] I don't care!
[HAMILTON] I do! Promise me, promise me, you won't try to clear my name... promise.
[Burr] Alright... I promise. But I don't understand.
[HAMILTON]
I'M LIMITED
JUST LOOK AT ME, I'M LIMITED
AND JUST LOOK AT YOU, YOU CAN DO ALL I COULDN'T DO, GLINDA

[HAMILTON] Here. Go on. Take this. Hands Her The Grimmerie.
[Burr] Elphie... you know I can't read that... Elphie...
[HAMILTON] Well then, you'll have to learn
NOW IT'S UP TO YOU
FOR BOTH OF US
NOW IT'S UP TO YOU
[HAMILTON] You're the only friend I've ever had.
[Burr] And I've had so many friends... but only one that mattered.

[Burr]
I'VE HEARD IT SAID
THAT PEOPLE COME INTO OUR LIVES FOR A REASON
BRINGING SOMETHING WE MUST LEARN
AND WE ARE LED TO THOSE
WHO HELP US MOST TO GROW
IF WE LET THEM
AND WE HELP THEM IN RETURN
WELL, I DON'T KNOW IF I BELIEVE THAT'S TRUE
BUT I KNOW I'M WHO I AM TODAY
BECAUSE I KNEW YOU
LIKE A COMMIT PULLED FROM ORBIT,
AS IT PASSES A SUN
LIKE A STREAM THAT MEETS A BOULDER
HALF WAY THROUGH THE WOOD
WHO CAN SAY IF I'VE BEEN CHANGED FOR THE BETTER?
BUT, BECAUSE I KNEW YOU...
I HAVE BEEN CHANGED
FOR GOOD...
[HAMILTON]
IT WELL MAY BE,
THAT WE WILL NEVER MEET AGAIN
IN THIS LIFETIME
SO LET ME SAY BEFORE WE PART
SO MUCH OF ME
IS MADE OF WHAT I LEARNED FROM YOU
YOU'LL BE WITH ME
LIKE A HANDPRINT ON MY HEART...
AND NOW WHATEVER WAY OUR STORIES END
I KNOW YOU HAVE RE-WRITTEN MINE
BY BEING MY FRIEND...
LIKE A SHIP BLOWN FROM IT'S MOORING
BY A WIND OFF THE SEA
LIKE A SEA DROP BY A SKY BIRD
IN A DISTANT WOOD
WHO CAN SAY IF I'VE BEEN CHANGED FOR THE BETTER?
BUT BECAUSE I KNEW YOU
[Burr]
BECAUSE I KNEW YOU
Both]
I HAVE BEEN CHANGED...
FOR GOOD...
[HAMILTON]
AND JUST TO CLEAR THE AIR
I ASK FORGIVNESS FOR THE THINGS I'VE DONE
YOU BLAME ME FOR.
[Burr]
BUT THEN I GUESS, WE KNOW THERE'S BLAME TO SHARE
Both]
AND NONE OF IT SEEMS TO MATTER ANYMORE!
[Burr] LIKE A COMET PULLED FROM ORBIT AS IT PASSES A SUN...
[HAMILTON] LIKE A SHIP BLOWN FROM ITS MOORING BY A WIND OFF THE SEA
[Burr] LIKE A STREAM THAT MEETS A BOULDER
[HAMILTON] LIKE A SEA DROP BY A BIRD
[Burr] HALFWAY THROUGH THE WOOD
[HAMILTON] IN THE WOOD
[Burr]
WHO CAN SAY IF I'VE BEEN CHANGED FOR THE BETTER?
Both]
I DO BELIEVE I HAVE BEEN CHANGED FOR THE BETTER.
[Burr]
AND, BECAUSE I KNEW YOU
[HAMILTON]
BECAUSE I KNEW YOU
Both]
BECAUSE I KNEW YOU
I HAVE BEEN CHANGED
FOR GOOD...


[HAMILTON] You have to hide. No one can know you were here. Hide yourself!
Elphaba Drapes A Scrim Around The Stage
Offstage Chorus of Women]
AND GOODNESS KNOWS
THE WICKED'S LIVES ARE LONELY
GOODNESS KNOWS THE WICKED DIE ALONE...
LAFAYETE and Other Witch Hunters Run In. You Can See The Silhouette Of The Action Happening Behind The Scrim. Glinda Is Downstage Watching The Action Take Place.
The Mob Surrounds The Witch And She Melts With A Scream The Mob Leaves And Glinda Comes Out From Hiding. She Moves Near The Scrim.
[Burr] Elphie? Elphie? Chistery opens the scrim, where just Elphaba's hat and the green bottle remain. Glinda cries, and grabs the had, holding it against her.
Chistery] Handing Her The Bottle. Miss, Miss Glinda.
[Morrible]
 Well, I don't know why you're so despondiary, I thought it went quite well! They seem thrilled to shreds with their brains and their hearts, and this and that.... Glinda Enters. Oh, Miss Glinda! I thought you'd be out festivating.
[Burr] This was Elphaba's. Holding Out The Bottle.
[Hamilton]
What's that you say?
[Burr] It was a keepsake. It was her mother's. She told me so herself.
I've only seen a little, green bottle like this one other time. It was right here, in this very room. You offered me a drink from it.
Lover's Song Played In Background.
[Hamilton]
But... oh my Lord...
I AM A SENTIMENTAL MAN
WHO ALWAYS LONGED TO BE...
a father...
[Morrible]
 So that was it. That's why she had such powers! She was a child of both worlds!
[Hamilton]
He Cries.
[Burr] I want you to leave [Oz. I'll make the pronouncement myself]
that the strains of wizardship have been too much for you and you are taking an indefinite leave of absence! Did you hear what I said?!
[Hamilton]
Yes, your goodness.
[Burr] You'd better go get your balloon ready. Guards!
He Exits.
[Morrible]
 Glinda, dear, I know we've had our miniscule differentiations in the past...
[Burr] Guards! Madame, have you ever considered how you'd fare in captivity?
[Morrible]
 What?
[Burr] Articulated. Captivity... prison! Personally, I don't think you'll hold up very well.
My professional opinion is that you do not have what it takes. I hope you prove me wrong.
I doubt you will. Take her away!
[Morrible]
 No!!!!

[Ozia]

GOOD NEWS! SHE'S DEAD!
THE WITCH OF THE WEST IS DEAD!
THE WICKEDEST WITCH THERE EVER WAS
THE ENEMY OF ALL OF US, HERE IN [Oz,
IS DEAD!
GOOD NEWS
GOOD NEWS!!!
The Scarecrow (Fiyero) Walks On Stage. He Bends Down & Knocks On A Trap Door In The Floor.
[BURR]
 It worked!
He Opens The Door & Elphaba Climbs Out.
[HAMILTON] Fiyero! I thought you'd never get here.
She Touches His Straw Face.
[BURR]
 Go ahead, touch, I don't mind. Ah, you did the best you could. You saved my life.
[HAMILTON] You're still beautiful.
[BURR]
 You don't have to lie to me.
[HAMILTON] It's not lying... its looking at things another way.
[Ozia]

NO ONE MOURNS THE WICKED
NOW AT LAST SHE'S DEAD AND GONE!
NOW AT LAST THERE'S JOY THROUGHOUT THE LAND!
[Burr] Fellow [Ozians, friends, we have been through a frightening time. There will be other times
and other things that frighten us. But if you let me, I'd like to try to help. I'd like to try to be... Glinda the Good.
[Ozia]

GOOD NEWS!!
[BURR]
 It's time to go.
[HAMILTON] We can never come back to [Oz, can we?
[BURR]
 No.
[HAMILTON] I only wish...
[BURR]
 What?
[HAMILTON] Glinda could know that we're alive.
[BURR]
 She can't know, not if we want to be safe. No one can ever know.
[Ozia]

GOOD NEWS...
[BURR]
 Come...
[Burr]
WHO CAN SAY IF I'VE BEEN CHANGED FOR THE BETTER? BUT...
Elphaba & [Burr]
BECAUSE I KNEW YOU...
[Ozia]

NO ONE MOURNS THE WICKED...
[Burr]
BECAUSE I KNEW YOU...
Elphaba & [Burr]
I HAVE BEEN CHANGED...
