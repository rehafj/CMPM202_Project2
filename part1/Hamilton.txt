[BURR]
How does a bastard, orphan, son of a whore and a
Scotsman, dropped in the middle of a
Forgotten spot in the Caribbean by providence
Impoverished, in squalor
Grow up to be a hero and a scholar?

[LAURENS]
The ten-dollar founding father without a father
Got a lot farther by working a lot harder
By being a lot smarter
By being a self-starter
By fourteen, they placed him in charge of a
Trading charter

[JEFFERSON]
And every day while slaves were being slaughtered and carted
Away across the waves, he struggled and kept his guard up
Inside, he was longing for something to be a part of
The brother was ready to beg, steal, borrow, or barter

[MADISON]
Then a hurricane came, and devastation reigned
Our man saw his future drip, dripping down the drain
Put a pencil to his temple, connected it to his brain
And he wrote his first refrain, a testament to his pain

[BURR]
Well, the word got around, they said, "This kid is insane, man"
Took up a collection just to send him to the mainland
"Get your education, don't forget from whence you came, and
The world is gonna know your name. What's your name, man?"

[HAMILTON]
Alexander Hamilton
My name is Alexander Hamilton
And there's a million things I haven't done
But just you wait, just you wait...

[ELIZA]
When he was ten his father split, full of it, debt-ridden
Two years later, see Alex and his mother bed-ridden
Half-dead sittin in their own sick, the scent thick

[COMPANY]
And Alex got better but his mother went quick

[WASHINGTON]
Moved in with a cousin, the cousin committed suicide
Left him with nothin' but ruined pride, something new inside
A voice saying
[WASHINGTON]
"You gotta fend for yourself." [COMPANY]
"Alex, you gotta fend for yourself."

[WASHINGTON]
He started retreatin' and readin' every treatise on the shelf
[BURR]
There would have been nothin' left to do
For someone less astute
He woulda been dead or destitute
Without a cent of restitution
Started workin', clerkin' for his late mother's landlord
Tradin' sugar cane and rum and all the things he can't afford
Scammin' for every book he can get his hands on
Plannin' for the future see him now as he stands on
The bow of a ship headed for a new land
In New York you can be a new man

[COMPANY]
In New York you can
Be a new man-
In New York you can
Be a new man-

[COMPANY]
Scammin'

Plannin'
Oooh...

[HAMILTON]
Just you wait!

Just you wait!

[COMPANY]
In New York you can be a new man-

[WOMEN]
In New York-

[MEN]
New York-

[HAMILTON]
Just you wait!
[COMPANY]
Alexander Hamilton

We are waiting in the wings for you

You could never back down
You never learned to take your time!

Oh, Alexander Hamilton

When America sings for you
Will they know what you overcame?
Will they know you rewrote the game?
The world will never be the same, oh

[BURR]
The ship is in the harbor now
See if you can spot him

Another immigrant
Comin' up from the bottom

His enemies destroyed his rep
America forgot him
[COMPANY]
Alexander Hamilton

Waiting in the wings for you

You never learned to take your time!

Oh, Alexander Hamilton
Alexander Hamilton...
America sings for you
Will they know what you overcame?
Will they know you rewrote the game?
The world will never be the same, oh

[MEN]
Just you wait

[COMPANY]
Just you wait

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE]
We fought with him

[LAURENS]
Me? I died for him

[WASHINGTON]
Me? I trusted him

[ELIZA/ANGELICA/MARIA]
Me? I loved him

[BURR]
And me? I'm the damn fool that shot him

[COMPANY]
There's a million things I haven't done
But just you wait!

[BURR]
What's your name, man?

Aaron Burr, Sir

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[COMPANY]
1776. New York City

[HAMILTON]
Pardon me. Are you Aaron Burr, sir?

[BURR]
That depends. Who's asking?

[HAMILTON]
Oh, well, sure, sir
I'm Alexander Hamilton, I'm at your service, sir
I have been looking for you

[BURR]
I'm getting nervous

[HAMILTON]
Sir...
I heard your name at Princeton. I was seeking an accelerated course of study when I got sort of out of sorts with a buddy of yours. I may have punched him. It's a blur, sir. He handles the financials?

[BURR]
You punched the bursar

[HAMILTON]
Yes!
I wanted to do what you did. Graduate in two, then join the revolution. He looked at me like I was stupid, I'm not stupid

So how'd you do it? How'd you graduate so fast?

[BURR]
It was my parents' dying wish before they passed

[HAMILTON]
You're an orphan. Of course! I'm an orphan
God, I wish there was a war!
Then we could prove that we're worth more
Than anyone bargained for...

[BURR]
Can I buy you a drink?

[HAMILTON]
That would be nice

[BURR]
While we're talking, let me offer you some free advice
Talk less

[HAMILTON]
What?

[BURR]
Smile more

[HAMILTON]
Ha

[BURR]
Don't let them know what you're against or what you're for

[HAMILTON]
You can't be serious

[BURR]
You wanna get ahead?

[HAMILTON]
Yes

[BURR]
Fools who run their mouths off wind up dead

[LAURENS]
Yo yo yo yo yo!
What time is it?

[LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
Show time!

[BURR]
...like I said...

[LAURENS]
Show time! Show time! Yo!
I'm John Laurens in the place to be!
Two pints o' Sam Adams, but I'm workin' on three, uh!
Those redcoats don't want it with me!
Cuz I will pop chick-a pop these cops till I'm free!

[LAFAYETTE]
Oui oui, mon ami, je m'appelle Lafayette!
The Lancelot of the revolutionary set!
I came from afar just to say "Bonsoir!"
Tell the King "Casse toi!" Who's the best?
C'est moi!

[MULLIGAN]
Brrrah brraaah! I am Hercules Mulligan
Up in it, lovin' it, yes I heard ya mother said "Come again?"
Lock up ya daughters and horses, of course
It's hard to have intercourse over four sets of corsets...

[LAURENS]
No more sex, pour me another brew, son!
Let's raise a couple more...

[LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
To the revolution!

[LAURENS]
Well, if it ain't the prodigy of Princeton college!

[MULLIGAN]
Aaron Burr!

[LAURENS]
Give us a verse, drop some knowledge!

[BURR]
Good luck with that: you're takin' a stand
You spit. I'm ‘a sit. We'll see where we land

[LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
Boooo!

[LAURENS]
Burr, the revolution's imminent. What do you stall for?

[HAMILTON]
If you stand for nothing, Burr, what'll you fall for?
[LAURENS]
Ooh
Who are you? [MULLIGAN]
Ooh

Who are you? [LAFAYETTE]
Ooh

Who are you?

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE/LAURENS]
Ooh, who is this kid? What's he gonna do?

My Shot

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[HAMILTON]
I am not throwing away my shot!
I am not throwing away my shot!
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot!
I'm ‘a get a scholarship to King's College
I prob'ly shouldn't brag, but dag, I amaze and astonish
The problem is I got a lot of brains but no polish
I gotta holler just to be heard
With every word, I drop knowledge!
I'm a diamond in the rough, a shiny piece of coal
Tryin' to reach my goal. My power of speech: unimpeachable
Only nineteen but my mind is older
These New York City streets get colder, I shoulder
Ev'ry burden, ev'ry disadvantage
I have learned to manage, I don't have a gun to brandish
I walk these streets famished
The plan is to fan this spark into a flame
But damn, it's getting dark, so let me spell out the name
I am the-

[HAMILTON/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN/LAURENS]
A-L-E-X-A-N-D
E-R-we are-meant to be...

[HAMILTON]
A colony that runs independently
Meanwhile, Britain keeps shittin' on us endlessly
Essentially, they tax us relentlessly
Then King George turns around, runs a spending spree
He ain't ever gonna set his descendants free
So there will be a revolution in this century
Enter me!

[LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN/LAURENS]
(He says in parentheses)

[HAMILTON]
Don't be shocked when your hist'ry book mentions me
I will lay down my life if it sets us free
Eventually, you'll see my ascendancy
[HAMILTON]
And I am not throwing away
My shot
I am not throwing away
My shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot
[LAURENS]
My shot!

My shot!

And I'm not throwing away my shot.

[HAMILTON/MULLIGAN/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE]
I am not throwing away my shot
I am not throwing away my shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot
It's time to take a shot!

[LAFAYETTE]
I dream of life without a monarchy
The unrest in France will lead to ‘onarchy?
‘Onarchy? How you say, how you say, ‘anarchy?'
When I fight, I make the other side panicky
With my-

[HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
Shot!

[MULLIGAN]
Yo, I'm a tailor's apprentice
And I got y'all knuckleheads in loco parentis
I'm joining the rebellion cuz I know it's my chance
To socially advance, instead of sewin' some pants!
I'm gonna take a-

[HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
Shot!

[LAURENS]
But we'll never be truly free
Until those in bondage have the same rights as you and me
You and I. Do or die. Wait till I sally in
On a stallion with the first black battalion
Have another-

[HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
Shot!

[BURR]
Geniuses, lower your voices
You keep out of trouble and you double your choices
I'm with you, but the situation is fraught
You've got to be carefully taught:
If you talk, you're gonna get shot!

[HAMILTON]
Burr, check what we got
Mister Lafayette, hard rock like Lancelot
I think your pants look hot
Laurens, I like you a lot
Let's hatch a plot blacker than the kettle callin' the pot...
What are the odds the gods would put us all in one spot
Poppin' a squat on conventional wisdom, like it or not
A bunch of revolutionary manumission abolitionists?
Give me a position, show me where the ammunition is!

Oh, am I talkin' too loud?
Sometimes I get over excited, shoot off at the mouth
I never had a group of friends before
I promise that I'll make y'all proud

[LAURENS]
Let's get this guy in front of a crowd

[HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN/ENSEMBLE]
I am not throwing away my shot
I am not throwing away my shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot

I am not throwing away my shot
I am not throwing away my shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot
[LAURENS]
Ev'rybody sing:
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Hey!
Whoa!
Wooh!!
Whoa!
Ay, let ‘em hear ya!

Let's go!

I said shout it to the rooftops!
Said, to the rooftops!
Come on!

MULLIGAN]
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

Whoa!

[LAURENS]
Rise up!
When you're living on your knees, you rise up
Tell your brother that he's gotta rise up
Tell your sister that she's gotta rise up
[LAURENS AND ENSEMBLE]
When are these colonies gonna rise up?
When are these colonies gonna rise up?
When are these colonies gonna rise up?
When are these colonies gonna rise up?

Rise up!
[COMPANY]
Whoa! Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!

Rise up!

[HAMILTON]
I imagine death so much it feels more like a memory
When's it gonna get me?
In my sleep? Seven feet ahead of me?
If I see it comin', do I run or do I let it be?
Is it like a beat without a melody?
See, I never thought I'd live past twenty
Where I come from some get half as many
Ask anybody why we livin' fast and we laugh, reach for a flask
We have to make this moment last, that's plenty

Scratch that
This is not a moment, it's the movement
Where all the hungriest brothers with
Something to prove went?
Foes oppose us, we take an honest stand
We roll like Moses, claimin' our promised land
And? If we win our independence?
‘Zat a guarantee of freedom for our descendants?
Or will the blood we shed begin an endless
Cycle of vengeance and death with no defendants?
I know the action in the street is excitin'
But Jesus, between all the bleedin' ‘n fightin'
I've been readin' ‘n writin'
We need to handle our financial situation
Are we a nation of states? What's the state of our nation?
I'm past patiently waitin'. I'm passionately
Smashin' every expectation
Every action's an act of creation!
I'm laughin' in the face of casualties and sorrow
For the first time, I'm thinkin' past tomorrow

[HAMILTON AND COMPANY]
And I am not throwing away my shot
I am not throwing away my shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot

They pull up in their carriages and gawk

Farmer Refuted

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[SEABURY]
Hear ye, hear ye! My name is Samuel Seabury
And I present "Free Thoughts on the
Proceedings of the Continental Congress!"
Heed not the rabble who scream revolution
They have not your interests at heart

[MULLIGAN]
Oh my God. Tear this dude apart

[SEABURY]
Chaos and bloodshed are not a solution
Don't let them lead you astray
This Congress does not speak for me

[BURR]
Let him be

[SEABURY]
They're playing a dangerous game
I pray the king shows you his mercy
For shame, for shame...
[HAMILTON]
Yo!
He'd have you all unravel at the
Sound of screams but the
Revolution is comin'
The have-nots are gonna
Win this
It's hard to listen to you with a straight face

Chaos and bloodshed already haunt us, honestly you shouldn't even talk. And what about Boston? Look at the cost, n' all that we've lost n' you talk
About Congress?!

My dog speaks more eloquently than thee!

But strangely, your mange is the same

Is he in Jersey?

For the revolution!
[SEABURY]
Heed not the rabble
Who scream
Revolution, they
Have not your
Interests
At heart

Chaos and bloodshed are
Not a
Solution. Don't
Let them lead you
Astray
This Congress does not
Speak for me

They're playing a dangerous game

I pray the king shows you his mercy

For shame

For shame,

[COMPANY]
For the revolution!

[SEABURY]
Heed-

[HAMILTON]
If you repeat yourself again I'm gonna-

Scream-

Honestly, look at me, please don't read!

[SEABURY]
Not your interests-

Don't modulate the key then not debate with me!
Why should a tiny island across the sea regulate the price of tea?

[BURR]
Alexander, please!

You'll Be Back

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[KING GEORGE]
You say
The price of my love's not a price that you're willing to pay
You cry
In your tea which you hurl in the sea when you see me go by
Why so sad?
Remember we made an arrangement when you went away
Now you're making me mad
Remember, despite our estrangement, I'm your man
You'll be back
Soon you'll see
You'll remember you belong to me
You'll be back
Time will tell
You'll remember that I served you well
Oceans rise
Empires fall
We have seen each other through it all
And when push
Comes to shove
I will send a fully armed battalion
To remind you of my love!

Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da
Da da dat dat da ya da!
Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da
Da da dat dat da...

You say our love is draining and you can't go on
You'll be the one complaining when I am gone...
And no, don't change the subject
Cuz you're my favorite subject
My sweet, submissive subject
My loyal, royal subject
Forever and ever and ever and ever and ever...

You'll be back
Like before
I will fight the fight and win the war
For your love
For your praise
And I'll love you till my dying days
When you're gone
I'll go mad
So don't throw away this thing we had

Cuz when push comes to shove
I will kill your friends and family to remind you of my love
Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da
Da da dat dat da ya da!
Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da
Da da dat-
Everybody!

[ENSEMBLE]
Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da
Da da dat dat da ya da!
Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da da da da

Let down my guard and tell the people how I feel a second?
Now I'm the model of a modern major general
The venerated Virginian veteran whose men are all
Lining up, to put me up on a pedestal
Writin' letters to relatives
Embellishin' my elegance and eloquence
But the elephant is in the room
The truth is in ya face when ya hear the British cannons go...

[ENSEMBLE]
Boom!

[WASHINGTON]
Any hope of success is fleeting
How can I keep leading when the people I'm
Leading keep retreating?
We put a stop to the bleeding as the British take Brooklyn
Knight takes rook, but look
[WASHINGTON]
We are outgunned

Outmanned

Outnumbered
Outplanned

We gotta make an all out stand
Ayo, I'm gonna need a right-hand man

Incoming!
[ENSEMBLE]
What?

What?

Buck, buck, buck, buck, buck!

Buck, buck, buck, buck, buck!

[HAMILTON]
They're battering down the Battery check the damages

[MULLIGAN]
Rah!

[HAMILTON]
We gotta stop ‘em and rob ‘em of their advantages

[MULLIGAN]
Rah!

[HAMILTON]
Let's take a stand with the stamina God has granted us
Hamilton won't abandon ship
Yo, let's steal their cannons-
[MULLIGAN]
Shh-boom! [COMPANY]
Boom!

[WASHINGTON]
Goes the cannon, watch the blood and the shit spray and...

[COMPANY]
Boom!

[WASHINGTON]
Goes the cannon, we're abandonin' Kips Bay and...

[COMPANY]
Boom!

[WASHINGTON]
There's another ship and...

[COMPANY]
Boom!

[WASHINGTON]
We just lost the southern tip and...

[COMPANY]
Boom!

[WASHINGTON]
We gotta run to Harlem quick, we can't afford another slip
Guns and horses giddyup
I decide to divvy up
My forces, they're skittish as the British cut the city up
This close to giving up, facing mad scrutiny
I scream in the face of this mass mutiny:
Are these the men with which I am to defend America?
We ride at midnight, Manhattan in the distance
I cannot be everywhere at once, people
I'm in dire need of assistance...

[BURR]
Your excellency, sir!

[WASHINGTON]
Who are you?

[BURR]
Aaron Burr, Sir?
Permission to state my case?

[WASHINGTON]
As you were

[BURR]
Sir
I was a captain under General Montgomery
Until he caught a bullet in the neck in Quebec
And well, in summary
I think that I could be of some assistance
I admire how you keep firing on the British
From a distance

[WASHINGTON]
Huh

[BURR]
I have some questions, a couple of suggestions on how to fight instead of fleeing west

[WASHINGTON]
Yes?

[BURR]
Well-

[HAMILTON]
Your excellency, you wanted to see me?

[WASHINGTON]
Hamilton, come in, have you met Burr?

[HAMILTON]
Yes, sir

[HAMILTON AND BURR]
We keep meeting

[BURR]
As I was saying, sir, I look forward to seeing your strategy play out

[WASHINGTON]
Burr?

[BURR]
Sir?

[WASHINGTON]
Close the door on your way out

[HAMILTON]
Have I done something wrong, sir?

[WASHINGTON]
On the contrary
I called you here because our odds are beyond scary
Your reputation precedes you, but I have to laugh

[HAMILTON]
Sir?

[WASHINGTON]
Hamilton, how come no one can get you on their staff?

[HAMILTON]
Sir!

[WASHINGTON]
Don't get me wrong, you're a young man, of great renown
I know you stole British cannons when we were still downtown
Nathaniel Green and Henry Knox wanted to hire you...

[HAMILTON]
To be their Secretary? I don't think so

[WASHINGTON]
Why're you upset?

[HAMILTON]
I'm not-

[WASHINGTON]
It's alright, you want to fight, you've got a hunger
I was just like you when I was younger
Head full of fantasies of dyin' like a martyr?

[HAMILTON]
Yes

[WASHINGTON]
Dying is easy, young man. Living is harder

[HAMILTON]
Why are you telling me this?

[WASHINGTON]
I'm being honest
I'm working with a third of what our Congress has promised
We are a powder keg about to explode
I need someone like you to lighten the load. So?

[COMPANY (EXCEPT HAMILTON)]
I am not throwin' away my shot!
I am not throwin' away my shot!
Ayo, I'm just like my country, I'm young
Scrappy and hungry!

[HAMILTON]
I am not throwing away my shot!

[WASHINGTON]
Son

[WASHINGON AND COMPANY]
We are outgunned, outmanned!

[HAMILTON]
You need all the help you can get
I have some friends. Laurens, Mulligan
Marquis de Lafayette, okay, what else?

[WASHINGTON AND COMPANY]
Outnumbered, outplanned!

[HAMILTON]
We'll need some spies on the inside
Some King's men who might let some things slide
[HAMILTON]
I'll write to Congress and tell ‘em we need supplies, you rally the guys, master the element of surprise

I'll rise above my station, organize your information, ‘til we rise to the occasion of our new nation. Sir!

[ENSEMBLE]
Here comes the General!

[HAMILTON]
Rise up!

[HAMILTON]
Rise up!

[ENSEMBLE]
Here comes the General!

[HAMILTON]
Rise up! [COMPANY]
Boom!

Chicka-boom!

A Winter's Ball

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[BURR]
How does the bastard, orphan, son of a whore
Go on and on
Grow into more of a phenomenon?
Watch this obnoxious, arrogant, loudmouth bother
Be seated at the right hand of the father
Washington hires Hamilton right on sight
But Hamilton still wants to fight, not write
Now Hamilton's skill with a quill is undeniable
But what do we have in common? We're
Reliable with the

[ALL MEN]
Ladies!

[BURR]
There are so many to deflower!

[ALL MEN]
Ladies!

[BURR]
Looks! Proximity to power

[ALL MEN]
Ladies!

[BURR]
They delighted and distracted him
Martha Washington named her feral tomcat after him!

[HAMILTON]
That's true

[FULL COMPANY]
1780

[BURR]
A winter's ball
And the Schuyler sisters are the envy of all
Yo, if you can marry a sister, you're rich, son

[HAMILTON]
Is it a question of if, Burr, or which one?

Hey

Helpless

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[HAMILTON/BURR/LAURENS/ALL WOMEN (EXCEPT ELIZA)]
Hey hey hey hey
[ELIZA]
Ohh, I do I do I do I
Dooo! Hey!
Ohh, I do I do I do I
Dooo! Boy you got me [ALL WOMEN]
Hey hey hey hey
Hey hey hey hey
Hey hey hey hey
Hey hey hey

[ELIZA AND WOMEN]
Helpless!
Look into your eyes, and the sky's the limit I'm helpless!
Down for the count, and I'm drownin' in ‘em

[ELIZA]
I have never been the type to try and grab the spotlight
We were at a revel with some rebels on a hot night
Laughin' at my sister as she's dazzling the room
Then you walked in and my heart went "Boom!"
Tryin' to catch your eye from the side of the ballroom
Everybody's dancin' and the band's top volume

[ELIZA AND WOMEN]
Grind to the rhythm as we wine and dine
[ELIZA]
Grab my sister, and
Whisper, "Yo, this
One's mine."

My sister made her way across the room to you
And I got nervous, thinking "What's she gonna do?"
She grabbed you by the arm, I'm thinkin' "I'm through"
Then you look back at me and suddenly I'm
Helpless!

Oh, look at those eyes

Oh!
Yeah, I'm
Helpless, I know

I'm so into you
I am so into you

I know I'm down for the count
And I'm drownin' in ‘em.

[ALL WOMEN]
Oooh

Oooh

Oooh

Oooh

Helpless!

Look into your eyes
And the sky's the limit
I'm
Helpless!
Down for the count
And I'm drownin' in ‘em

I'm helpless!

Look into your eyes
And the sky's the limit I'm helpless!

Down for the count
And I'm drownin' in ‘em.

[HAMILTON]
Where are you taking me?

[ANGELICA]
I'm about to change your life

[HAMILTON]
Then by all means, lead the way

[ELIZA]
Elizabeth Schuyler. It's a pleasure to meet you

[HAMILTON]
Schuyler?

[ANGELICA]
My sister

[ELIZA]
Thank you for all your service

[HAMILTON]
If it takes fighting a war for us to meet, it will have been worth it

[ANGELICA]
I'll leave you to it

[ELIZA AND WOMEN]
One week later

[ELIZA]
I'm writin' a letter nightly
Now my life gets better, every letter that you write me
Laughin' at my sister, cuz she wants to form a harem

[ANGELICA]
I'm just sayin', if you really loved me, you would share him
[ELIZA]
Ha!
Two weeks later
In the living room stressin'
My father's stone-faced
While you're asking for his blessin'
I'm dying inside, as
You wine
And dine
And I'm tryin' not to cry
‘cause there's nothing that your mind can't do
My father makes his way across the room
To you
I panic for a second, thinking
"we're through"
But then he shakes your hand and says
"Be true"
And you turn back to me, smiling, and I'm
Helpless!

Helpless!
Hoo!

That boy is mine
That boy is mine!

Helpless! Helpless!
Down for the count
And I'm drownin' in em

[ALL WOMEN]
Stressin'

Blessin'

Oooh

Oooh

Oooh

Oooh

Helpless!
Look into your eyes
And the sky's the
Limit I'm
Helpless!
Down for the count
And I'm drownin' in
‘em I'm
Helpless!

Look into your eyes
And the sky's the
Limit I'm
Helpless!
Down for the count
And I'm drownin' in em

[HAMILTON]
Eliza, I don't have a dollar to my name
An acre of land, a troop to command, a dollop of fame
All I have's my honor, a tolerance for pain
A couple of college credits and my top-notch brain
Insane, your family brings out a different side of me
Peggy confides in me, Angelica tried to take a bite of me
No stress, my love for you is never in doubt
We'll get a little place in Harlem and we'll figure it out
I've been livin' without a family since I was a child
My father left, my mother died, I grew up buckwild
But I'll never forget my mother's face, that was real
And long as I'm alive, Eliza, swear to God
You'll never feel so...

[HAMILTON]
Eliza...

I've never felt so-

My life is gon' be fine cuz Eliza's in it.
[ELIZA]
I do I do I do I do!

I do I do I do I do!

Hey, yeah, yeah!

I'm down for the count
I'm-

I look into your eyes, and the sky's the limit
I'm

...drownin' in ‘em. [ALL WOMEN]
Helpless!

Helpless!

Helpless!

Down for the count
And I'm drownin' in ‘em

Helpless!

Helpless!

Helpless!

Down for the count
And I'm drownin' in ‘em.

Satisfied

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[LAURENS]
Alright, alright. That's what I'm talkin' about!
Now everyone give it up for the maid of honor
Angelica Schuyler!
[ANGELICA]
A toast to the groom!

To the bride!

From your sister

Who is always by your side

To your union

And the hope that you provide

May you always...

Be satisfied.

[ALL MEN]
To the groom!
To the groom!
To the groom!

To the bride!
To the bride!

Angelica!
Angelica!
Angelica!

By your side!

To the union!
To the revolution!

You provide!
You provide!

[HAMILTON AND MEN]
Always-

Rewind-

[ALL WOMEN]
To the groom!

To the bride!

To the bride!

[ELIZA AND WOMEN]
Angelica!

By your side!

To the union!
To the revolution!

You provide!

Always-

Rewind-

[ANGELICA]
I remember that night, I just might
Regret that night for the rest of my days

I remember those soldier boys
Tripping over themselves to win our praise

I remember that dreamlike candlelight
Like a dream that you can't quite place

But Alexander, I'll never forget the first
Time I saw your face

I have never been the same
Intelligent eyes in a hunger-pang frame
And when you said "Hi," I forgot my dang name
Set my heart aflame, ev'ry part aflame

[FULL COMPANY]
This is not a game...

[HAMILTON]
You strike me as a woman who has never been satisfied

[ANGELICA]
I'm sure I don't know what you mean. You forget yourself

[HAMILTON]
You're like me. I'm never satisfied

[ANGELICA]
Is that right?

[HAMILTON]
I have never been satisfied

[ANGELICA]
My name is Angelica Schuyler

[HAMILTON]
Alexander Hamilton

[ANGELICA]
Where's your fam'ly from?

[HAMILTON]
Unimportant. There's a million things I haven't done but
Just you wait, just you wait...

[ANGELICA]
So so so-
So this is what it feels like to match wits
With someone at your level! What the hell is the catch? It's
The feeling of freedom, of seein' the light
It's Ben Franklin with a key and a kite! You see it, right?
The conversation lasted two minutes, maybe three minutes
Ev'rything we said in total agreement, it's
A dream and it's a bit of a dance
A bit of a posture, it's a bit of a stance. He's a
Bit of a flirt, but I'm ‘a give it a chance
I asked about his fam'ly, did you see his answer?
His hands started fidgeting, he looked askance?
He's penniless, he's flying by the seat of his pants

Handsome, boy, does he know it!
Peach fuzz, and he can't even grow it!
I wanna take him far away from this place
Then I turn and see my sister's face and she is...

[ELIZA]
Helpless...

[ANGELICA]
And I know she is...

[ELIZA]
Helpless...

[ANGELICA]
And her eyes are just...

[ELIZA]
Helpless...

[ANGELICA]
And I realize

[ANGELICA AND COMPANY]
Three fundamental truths at the exact same time...

[HAMILTON]
Where are you taking me?

[ANGELICA]
I'm about to change your life

[HAMILTON]
Then by all means, lead the way

[COMPANY (EXCEPT ANGELICA)]
Number one!

[ANGELICA]
I'm a girl in a world in which
My only job is to marry rich
My father has no sons so I'm the one
Who has to social climb for one
So I'm the oldest and the wittiest and the gossip in
New York City is insidious
Alexander is penniless
Ha! That doesn't mean I want him any less

[ELIZA]
Elizabeth Schuyler. It's a pleasure to meet you

[HAMILTON]
Schuyler?

[ANGELICA]
My sister

[COMPANY]
Number two!

[ANGELICA]
He's after me cuz I'm a Schuyler sister
That elevates his status, I'd
Have to be naïve to set that aside
Maybe that is why I introduce him to Eliza
Now that's his bride
Nice going, Angelica, he was right
You will never be satisfied

[ELIZA]
Thank you for all your service

[HAMILTON]
If it takes fighting a war for us to meet, it will have been worth it

[ANGELICA]
I'll leave you to it

[COMPANY]
Number three!

[ANGELICA]
I know my sister like I know my own mind
You will never find anyone as trusting or as kind
If I tell her that I love him she'd be silently resigned
He'd be mine
She would say, "I'm fine"

[ANGELICA AND COMPANY]
She'd be lying

[ANGELICA]
But when I fantasize at night
It's Alexander's eyes
As I romanticize what might
Have been if I hadn't sized him
Up so quickly
At least my dear Eliza's his wife;
At least I keep his eyes in my life...
[ANGELICA]
To the groom!

To the bride!

From your sister

Who is always by your side

To your union

And the hope that you provide

May you always

Be satisfied

And I know

She'll be happy as

His bride
And I know [ALL MEN (EXCEPT HAMILTON)]
To the groom!
To the groom!
To the groom!

To the bride!
To the bride!

Angelica!
Angelica!

By your side

To the union!
To the revolution!

You provide!
You provide!

[HAMILTON AND MEN]
Always-

Be satisfied

Be satisfied

[MEN]
Be satisfied
Be satisfied
Be satisfied
Be satisfied

Be satisfied
Be satisfied

Be satisfied
Be satisfied
Be satisfied
Be satisfied.

[ALL WOMEN (EXCEPT ELIZA)]
To the groom!

To the bride!

To the bride!

[ELIZA AND WOMEN]
Angelica!

By your side

To the union!
To the revolution!

You provide!

Always-

Be satisfied

[WOMEN]
Be satisfied

Be satisfied

The Story of Tonight (Reprise)

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[LAURENS]
I may not live to see our glory!

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE]
I may not live to see our glory!

[LAURENS]
But I've seen wonders great and small

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE]
I've seen wonders great and small

[LAURENS]
‘Cause if the tomcat can get married

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE]
If Alexander can get married-

[LAURENS]
There's hope for our ass, after all!

[LAFAYETTE]
Raise a glass to freedom

[LAURENS/MULLIGAN]
Hey!
Something you will never see again!

[MULLIGAN]
No matter what she tells you

[LAFAYETTE]
Let's have another round tonight!

[LAURENS]
Raise a glass to the four of us!

[LAFAYETTE/HAMILTON]
Ho!

[MULLIGAN]
To the newly not poor of us!

[LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/HAMILTON]
Woo!

[LAFAYETTE]
We'll tell the story of tonight

[LAURENS]
Let's have another round-

[HAMILTON]
Well, if it isn't Aaron Burr

[BURR]
Sir!

[HAMILTON]
I didn't think that you would make it

[BURR]
To be sure

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE]
Burr!

[BURR]
I came to say congratulations

[MULLIGAN]
Spit a verse, Burr!

[BURR]
I see the whole gang is here

[LAFAYETTE]
You are the worst, Burr!

[HAMILTON]
Ignore them. Congrats to you, Lieutenant Colonel
I wish I had your command instead of manning George's journal

[BURR]
No, you don't

[HAMILTON]
Yes, I do

[BURR]
Now, be sensible
From what I hear, you've made yourself indispensable

[LAURENS]
Well, well, I heard
You've got a special someone on the side, Burr

[HAMILTON]
Is that so?

[LAURENS]
What are you tryin' to hide, Burr?

[BURR]
I should go

[HAMILTON]
No, these guys should go

[LAFAYETTE]
What?

[LAURENS]
No!

[HAMILTON]
Leave us alone

[MULLIGAN]
Man...

[HAMILTON]
It's alright, Burr. I wish you'd brought this girl with you tonight, Burr

[BURR]
You're very kind, but I'm afraid it's unlawful, sir

[HAMILTON]
What do you mean?

[BURR]
She's married

[HAMILTON]
I see

[BURR]
She's married to a British officer

[HAMILTON]
Oh shit...

[BURR]
Congrats again, Alexander. Smile more
I'll see you on the other side of the war

[HAMILTON]
I will never understand you
If you love this woman, go get her! What are you waiting for?

[BURR]
I'll see you on the other side of the war

[HAMILTON]
I'll see you on the other side of the war

Wait For It

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[BURR]
Theodosia writes me a letter everyday
I'm keeping the bed warm while her husband is away
He's on the British side in Georgia
He's trying to keep the colonies in line
But he can keep all of Georgia
Theodosia, she's mine

Love doesn't discriminate
Between the sinners
And the saints
It takes and it takes and it takes
And we keep loving anyway
We laugh and we cry
And we break
And we make our mistakes
And if there's a reason I'm by her side
When so many have tried
Then I'm willing to wait for it
I'm willing to wait for it
[BURR]
My grandfather was a fire and brimstone preacher

But there are things that the
Homilies and hymns won't teach ya

My mother was a genius

My father commanded respect

When they died they left no instructions
Just a legacy to protect

[MEN]
Preacher, preacher
Preacher

Teach ya, teach ya, teach ya

Respect, respect

[WOMEN]
Genius

[BURR/ENSEMBLE]
Death doesn't discriminate
Between the sinners
And the saints
It takes and it takes and it takes
And we keep living anyway
We rise and we fall
And we break
And we make our mistakes
And if there's a reason I'm still alive
When everyone who loves me has died
I'm willing to wait for it
I'm willing to wait for it

He plays and he raises the stakes
And if there's a reason
He seems to thrive when so few survive, then Goddamnit-
[BURR]
I'm willing to wait for it

I'm willing to wait for it...

Between the sinners and the saints
It takes and it takes and it takes

Stay Alive

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[ELIZA]
Stay alive...

[ELIZA/ANGELICA/ENSEMBLE WOMEN]
Stay alive...

[HAMILTON]
I have never seen the General so despondent
I have taken over writing all his correspondence
Congress writes, "George, attack the British forces."
I shoot back, we have resorted to eating our horses
Local merchants deny us equipment, assistance
They only take British money, so sing a song of sixpence

[WASHINGTON]
The cavalry's not coming

[HAMILTON]
Sir!

[WASHINGTON]
Alex, listen. There's only one way for us to win this
Provoke outrage, outright

[HAMILTON]
That's right

[WASHINGTON]
Don't engage, strike by night
Remain relentless ‘til their troops take flight

[HAMILTON]
Make it impossible to justify the cost of the fight

[WASHINGTON]
Outrun

[HAMILTON]
Outrun

[WASHINGTON]
Outlast

[HAMILTON]
Outlast

[WASHINGTON]
Hit ‘em quick, get out fast

[HAMILTON]
Chick-a-plao!

[WASHINGTON]
Stay alive ‘til this horror show is past
We're gonna fly a lot of flags half-mast

[HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE]
Raise a glass!

[MULLIGAN]
I go back to New York and my apprenticeship

[LAFAYETTE]
I ask for French aid, I pray that France has sent a ship

[LAURENS]
I stay at work with Hamilton
We write essays against slavery
And every day's a test of our camaraderie
And bravery

[HAMILTON]
We cut supply lines, we steal contraband
We pick and choose our battles and places to take a stand
And ev'ry day
"Sir, entrust me with a command,"
And ev'ry day

[WASHINGTON]
No

[HAMILTON]
He dismisses me out of hand
[HAMILTON]
Instead of me
He promotes
Charles Lee
Makes him second-in-command:

[LEE]
Charles Lee. [ELIZA/ANGELICA]
Stay alive...

[LEE]
I'm a General. Whee!!!!

[HAMILTON]
Yeah. He's not the choice I would have gone with

[HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE]
He shits the bed at the Battle of Monmouth

[WASHINGTON]
Ev'ryone attack!

[LEE]
Retreat!

[WASHINGTON]
Attack!

[LEE]
Retreat!

[WASHINGTON]
What are you doing, Lee? Get back on your feet!

[LEE]
But there's so many of them!

[WASHINGTON]
I'm sorry, is this not your speed?!
Hamilton!

[HAMILTON]
Ready, sir!

[WASHINGTON]
Have Lafayette take the lead!

[HAMILTON]
Yes, sir!

[LAURENS]
A thousand soldiers die in a hundred degree heat

[LAFAYETTE]
As we snatch a stalemate from the jaws of defeat

[HAMILTON]
Charles Lee was left behind
Without a pot to piss in
He started sayin' this to anybody who would listen:

[LEE]
Washington cannot be left alone to his devices
Indecisive, from crisis to crisis
The best thing he can do for the revolution
Is turn n' go back to plantin' tobacco in Mount Vernon

[COMPANY]
Oo!!

[WASHINGTON]
Don't do a thing. History will prove him wrong

[HAMILTON]
But, sir!

[WASHINGTON]
We have a war to fight, let's move along

[LAURENS]
Strong words from Lee, someone oughta hold him to it

[HAMILTON]
I can't disobey direct orders

[LAURENS]
Then I'll do it
Alexander, you're the closest friend I've got

[HAMILTON]
Laurens, do not throw away your shot

Ten Duel Commandments

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[MEN]
One, two, three, four

[FULL COMPANY]
Five, six, seven, eight, nine...

[BURR/HAMILTON/LAURENS/LEE]
It's the Ten Duel Commandments

[FULL COMPANY]
It's the Ten Duel Commandments
Number one!

[LAURENS]
The challenge: demand satisfaction
If they apologize, no need for further action

[COMPANY]
Number two!

[LAURENS]
If they don't, grab a friend, that's your second

[HAMILTON]
Your lieutenant when there's reckoning to be reckoned

[COMPANY]
Number three!

[LEE]
Have your seconds meet face to face

[BURR]
Negotiate a peace...

[HAMILTON]
Or negotiate a time and place

[BURR]
This is commonplace, ‘specially ‘tween recruits

[COMPANY]
Most disputes die, and no one shoots
Number four!

[LAURENS]
If they don't reach a peace, that's alright
Time to get some pistols and a doctor on site

[HAMILTON]
You pay him in advance, you treat him with civility

[BURR]
You have him turn around so he can have deniability

[COMPANY]
Five!

[LEE]
Duel before the sun is in the sky

[COMPANY]
Pick a place to die where it's high and dry
Number six!

[HAMILTON]
Leave a note for your next of kin
Tell ‘em where you been. Pray that hell or heaven lets you in

[COMPANY]
Seven!

[LEE]
Confess your sins. Ready for the moment of adrenaline when you finally face your opponent

[COMPANY]
Number eight!

[LAURENS/LEE/HAMILTON/BURR]
Your last chance to negotiate
Send in your seconds, see if they can set the record straight...

[BURR]
Alexander

[HAMILTON]
Aaron Burr, sir

[BURR]
Can we agree that duels are dumb and immature?

[HAMILTON]
Sure
But your man has to answer for his words, Burr

[BURR]
With his life? We both know that's absurd, sir

[HAMILTON]
Hang on, how many men died because Lee was inexperienced and ruinous?

[BURR]
Okay, so we're doin' this

[COMPANY]
Number nine!

[HAMILTON]
Look ‘em in the eye, aim no higher
Summon all the courage you require
Then count

[MEN]
One two three four

[FULL COMPANY]
Five six seven eight nine

[HAMILTON/BURR]
Number

[COMPANY]
Ten paces!

[HAMILTON/BURR]
Fire!

Meet Me Inside

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[HAMILTON]
Lee, do you yield?

[BURR]
You shot him in the side!
Yes, he yields!

[LAURENS]
I'm satisfied

[BURR]
Yo, we gotta clear the field!

[HAMILTON]
Go! We won

[COMPANY]
Here comes the General!

[BURR]
This should be fun

[WASHINGTON]
What is the meaning of this? Mr. Burr, get a medic for the General

[BURR]
Yes, sir

[WASHINGTON]
Lee, you will never agree with me
But believe me, these young men don't speak for me
Thank you for your service

[BURR]
Let's ride!

[WASHINGTON]
Hamilton!

[HAMILTON]
Sir!

[WASHINGTON]
Meet me inside

[COMPANY]
Meet him inside! Meet him inside!
Meet him inside, meet him, meet him inside!

[WASHINGTON]
Son-

[HAMILTON]
Don't call me son

[WASHINGTON]
This war is hard enough
Without infighting-

[HAMILTON]
Lee called you out. We called his bluff

[WASHINGTON]
You solve nothing, you aggravate our allies to the south

[HAMILTON]
You're absolutely right, John should have shot him in the mouth
That would've shut him up

[WASHINGTON]
Son-

[HAMILTON]
I'm notcha son-

[WASHINGTON]
Watch your tone
I am not a maiden in need of defending, I am grown

[HAMILTON (OVERLAPPING)]
Charles Lee, Thomas Conway
These men take your name and they rake it
Through the mud

[WASHINGTON]
My name's been through a lot, I can take it

[HAMILTON]
Well, I don't have your name. I don't have your titles
I don't have your land
But, if you-

[WASHINGTON]
No-

[HAMILTON]
If you gave me command of a battalion, a group of men to lead, I could fly above my station after the war

[WASHINGTON]
Or you could die and we need you alive

[HAMILTON]
I'm more than willing to die-

[WASHINGTON]
Your wife needs you alive, son, I need you alive-

[HAMILTON]
Call me son one more time-

[WASHINGTON]
Go home, Alexander
That's an order from your commander

[HAMILTON]
Sir-

[WASHINGTON]
Go home

That Would Be Enough

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[ELIZA]
Look around, look around at how lucky we are
To be alive right now
Look around, look around...

[HAMILTON]
How long have you known?

[ELIZA]
A month or so

[HAMILTON]
Eliza, you should have told me

[ELIZA]
I wrote to the General a month ago

[HAMILTON]
No

[ELIZA]
I begged him to send you home

[HAMILTON]
You should have told me

[ELIZA]
I'm not sorry
[ELIZA]
I knew you'd fight
Until the war was won

But you deserve a chance to meet your son
Look around, look around at how lucky we are
To be alive right now.
[HAMILTON]
The war's not
Done.

[HAMILTON]
Will you relish being a poor man's wife
Unable to provide for your life?

[ELIZA]
I relish being your wife
Look around, look around...

Look at where you are
Look at where you started
The fact that you're alive is a miracle
Just stay alive, that would be enough

And if this child
Shares a fraction of your smile
Or a fragment of your mind, look out world!
That would be enough

I don't pretend to know
The challenges you're facing
The worlds you keep erasing and creating in your mind

But I'm not afraid
I know who I married
So long as you come home at the end of the day
That would be enough

We don't need a legacy
We don't need money
If I could grant you peace of mind

If you could let me inside your heart...
Oh, let me be a part of the narrative
In the story they will write someday
Let this moment be the first chapter:
Where you decide to stay
And I could be enough
And we could be enough
That would be enough

Guns and Ships

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[BURR]
How does a ragtag volunteer army in need of a shower
Somehow defeat a global superpower?
How do we emerge victorious from the quagmire?
Leave the battlefield waving Betsy Ross' flag higher?
Yo. Turns out we have a secret weapon!
An immigrant you know and love who's unafraid to step in!
He's constantly confusin', confoundin' the British henchmen
Ev'ryone give it up for America's favorite fighting Frenchman!

[COMPANY]
Lafayette!

[LAFAYETTE]
I'm takin this horse by the reins makin'
Redcoats redder with bloodstains

[COMPANY]
Lafayette!

[LAFAYETTE]
And I'm never gonna stop until I make ‘em
Drop and burn ‘em up and scatter their remains, I'm

[COMPANY]
Lafayette!

[LAFAYETTE]
Watch me engagin' em! Escapin' em!
Enragin' em! I'm-

[COMPANY]
Lafayette!

[LAFAYETTE]
I go to France for more funds

[COMPANY]
Lafayette!

[LAFAYETTE]
I come back with more

[LAFAYETTE AND ENSEMBLE]
Guns
And ships
And so the balance shifts

[WASHINGTON]
We rendezvous with Rochambeau, consolidate their gifts

[LAFAYETTE]
We can end this war at Yorktown, cut them off at sea, but
For this to succeed, there's someone else we need:

[WASHINGTON]
I know

[WASHINGTON AND COMPANY]
Hamilton!

[LAFAYETTE]
Sir, he knows what to do in a trench
Ingenuitive and fluent in French, ami-

[WASHINGTON AND COMPANY]
Hamilton!

[LAFAYETTE]
Sir, you're gonna have to use him eventually
What's he gonna do on the bench? I mean-

[WASHINGTON AND COMPANY]
Hamilton!

[LAFAYETTE]
No one has more resilience
Or matches my practical tactical brilliance-

[WASHINGTON AND COMPANY]
Hamilton!
[LAFAYETTE]
You wanna fight for your land back?

[WASHINGTON]
I need my right hand man back!

[LAFAYETTE]
Ah! Uh, get ya right hand man back
You know you gotta get ya right hand man back

I mean you gotta put some thought into the letter but the sooner the better
To get your right hand man back!

[COMPANY]
Hamilton!

[WOMEN]

Hamilton!

Hamilton, Hamilton!
Ha- ha-!

[MEN]
Get your right hand man back!

Your right hand man back!

Hamilton!
Ha-
Ha-

Hamilton, Hamilton!
Ha- ha-!

[WASHINGTON]
Alexander Hamilton
Troops are waiting in the field for you
If you join us right now, together we can turn the tide
Oh, Alexander Hamilton
I have soldiers who will yield for you
If we manage to get this right
They'll surrender by early light
The world will never be the same, Alexander...

History Has Its Eyes On You

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[WASHINGTON]
I was younger than you are now
When I was given my first command
I led my men straight into a massacre
I witnessed their deaths firsthand
I made every mistake
I felt the shame rise in me
And even now I lie awake
[WASHINGTON]
Knowing history has its eyes on me

[HAMILTON/WASHINGTON]
History has its eyes on me. [LAURENS/MULLIGAN]
Whoa...
Whoa...
Whoa...
Yeah

[COMPANY]
Whoa...
Whoa...
Whoa...
Yeah

[WASHINGTON]
Let me tell you what I wish I'd known
When I was young and dreamed of glory:
You have no control:

[WASHINGTON AND COMPANY]
Who lives, who dies, who tells your story

[WASHINGTON]
I know that we can win
I know that greatness lies in you
But remember from here on in
[WASHINGTON/HAMILTON AND MEN]
History has its
Eyes on you.

[ENSEMBLE]
Whoa...
Whoa...

Yorktown (The World Turned Upside Down)

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[COMPANY]
The battle of Yorktown. 1781

[LAFAYETTE]
Monsieur Hamilton

[HAMILTON]
Monsieur Lafayette

[LAFAYETTE]
In command where you belong

[HAMILTON]
How you say, no sweat
We're finally on the field. We've had quite a run

[LAFAYETTE]
Immigrants:

[HAMILTON/LAFAYETTE]
We get the job done

[HAMILTON]
So what happens if we win?

[LAFAYETTE]
I go back to France
I bring freedom to my people if I'm given the chance

[HAMILTON]
We'll be with you when you do

[LAFAYETTE]
Go lead your men

[HAMILTON]
See you on the other side

[LAFAYETTE]
‘Til we meet again, let's go!

[ENSEMBLE]
I am not throwin' away my shot!
I am not throwin' away my shot!
Hey yo, I'm just like my country, I'm young
Scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwin' away my shot!
I am not throwin' away my shot!

[HAMILTON]
‘Til the world turns upside down...

[ENSEMBLE]
‘Til the world turns upside down!

[HAMILTON]
I imagine death so much it feels more like a memory
This is where it gets me: on my feet
The enemy ahead of me
If this is the end of me, at least I have a friend with me
Weapon in my hand, a command, and my men with me
Then I remember my Eliza's expecting me...
Not only that, my Eliza's expecting
We gotta go, gotta get the job done
Gotta start a new nation, gotta meet my son!
Take the bullets out your gun!

[ENSEMBLE]
What?

[HAMILTON]
The bullets out your gun!

[ENSEMBLE]
What?

[HAMILTON]
We move under cover and we move as one
Through the night, we have one shot to live another day
We cannot let a stray gunshot give us away
We will fight up close, seize the moment and stay in it
It's either that or meet the business end of a bayonet
The code word is ‘Rochambeau,' dig me?

[ENSEMBLE]
Rochambeau!

[HAMILTON]
You have your orders now, go, man, go!
And so the American experiment begins
With my friends all scattered to the winds
Laurens is in South Carolina, redefining brav'ry

[HAMILTON/LAURENS]
We'll never be free until we end slavery!

[HAMILTON]
When we finally drive the British away
Lafayette is there waiting-

[HAMILTON/LAFAYETTE]
In Chesapeake Bay!

[HAMILTON]
How did we know that this plan would work?
We had a spy on the inside. That's right

[HAMILTON/COMPANY]
Hercules Mulligan!

[MULLIGAN]
A tailor spyin' on the British government!
I take their measurements, information and then I smuggle it

[COMPANY]
Up

[MULLIGAN]
To my brother's revolutionary covenant
I'm runnin' with the Sons of Liberty and I am lovin' it!
See, that's what happens when you up against the ruffians
We in the shit now, somebody gotta shovel it!
Hercules Mulligan, I need no introduction
When you knock me down I get the fuck back up again!

[COMPANY]
Left! Right! Hold!
Go!
What! What! What!

[HAMILTON]
After a week of fighting, a young man in a red coat stands on a parapet

[LAFAYETTE]
We lower our guns as he frantically waves a white handkerchief

[MULLIGAN]
And just like that, it's over. We tend to our wounded, we count our dead

[LAURENS]
Black and white soldiers wonder alike if this really means freedom

[WASHINGTON]
Not. Yet

[HAMILTON]
We negotiate the terms of surrender
I see George Washington smile
We escort their men out of Yorktown
They stagger home single file
Tens of thousands of people flood the streets
There are screams and church bells ringing
And as our fallen foes retreat
I hear the drinking song they're singing...

[ALL MEN]
The world turned upside down

[FULL COMPANY]
The world turned upside down
The world turned upside down
The world turned upside down
Down
Down, down, down

[LAFAYETTE]
Freedom for America, freedom for France!

[COMPANY]
Down, down, down

[HAMILTON]
Gotta start a new nation
Gotta meet my son

[COMPANY]
Down, down, down

[MULLIGAN]
We won!

[LAFAYETTE]
We won!

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE/LAURENS]
We won!

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE/LAURENS/HAMILTON/WASHINGTON]
We won!

[COMPANY]
The world turned upside down!

What Comes Next

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[KING GEORGE]
They say
The price of my war's not a price that they're willing to pay
Insane
You cheat with the French, now I'm fighting with France and with Spain
I'm so blue
I thought that we'd made an arrangement
When you went away
You were mine to subdue
Well, even despite our estrangement, I've got
A small query for you:

What comes next?
You've been freed
Do you know how hard it is to lead?

You're on your own
Awesome. Wow
Do you have a clue what happens now?

Oceans rise
Empires fall
It's much harder when it's all your call

All alone, across the sea
When your people say they hate you, don't
Come crawling back to me

Da da da dat da dat da da da
Da ya da
Da da dat
Da da ya da...

You're on your own...

Dear Theodosia

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[BURR]
Dear Theodosia, what to say to you?
You have my eyes. You have your mother's name

When you came into the world, you cried and it broke my heart

I'm dedicating every day to you
Domestic life was never quite my style
When you smile, you knock me out, I fall apart
And I thought I was so smart

You will come of age with our young nation
We'll bleed and fight for you, we'll make it right for you
If we lay a strong enough foundation
We'll pass it on to you, we'll give the world to you
And you'll blow us all away...
Someday, someday
Yeah, you'll blow us all away
Someday, someday

[HAMILTON]
Oh Philip, when you smile I am undone
My son
Look at my son. Pride is not the word I'm looking for

There is so much more inside me now
Oh Philip, you outshine the morning sun
My son
When you smile, I fall apart
And I thought I was so smart
My father wasn't around

[BURR]
My father wasn't around
[HAMILTON]
I swear that
I'll be around for you.
[BURR]
I'll be around for you.

[HAMILTON]
I'll do whatever it takes

[BURR]
I'll make a million mistakes

[BURR/HAMILTON]
I'll make the world safe and sound for you...
...will come of age with our young nation
We'll bleed and fight for you, we'll make it right for you

If we lay a strong enough foundation
We'll pass it on to you, we'll give the world to you
And you'll blow us all away...
Someday, someday
Yeah, you'll blow us all away

Non-Stop

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

After the war I went back to New York

[HAMILTON]
A-After the war I went back to New York

[BURR]
I finished up my studies and I practiced law

[HAMILTON]
I practiced law, Burr worked next door
[BURR]
Even though we started at the very same time
Alexander Hamilton began to climb
How to account for his rise to the top?
Maaaaan, the man is
Non-stop!

[ENSEMBLE]
Non-stop!

[HAMILTON]
Gentlemen of the jury, I'm curious, bear with me
Are you aware that we're making hist'ry?
This is the first murder trial of our brand-new nation
[HAMILTON]
The liberty behind
Deliberation-

[ENSEMBLE]
Non-stop!

[HAMILTON]
I intend to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt
With my assistant counsel-

[BURR]
Co-counsel
Hamilton, sit down
Our client Levi Weeks is innocent. Call your first witness
That's all you had to say!

[HAMILTON]
Okay!
One more thing-

[BURR]
Why do you assume you're the smartest in the room?
Why do you assume you're the smartest in the room?
Why do you assume you're the smartest in the room?
Soon that attitude may be your doom!

[ENSEMBLE]
Awwww!

[BURR]
Why do you write like you're running out of time?
Write day and night like you're running out of time?
Ev'ry day you fight, like you're running out of time

Keep on fighting. In the meantime- [ENSEMBLE]
Why do you write like you're running out of time?

Ev'ry day you fight, like you're running out of time

Non-stop!

[HAMILTON]
Corruption's such an old song that we can sing along in harmony
And nowhere is it stronger than in Albany
This colony's economy's increasingly stalling and

[HAMILTON]
Honestly, that's why public service
Seems to be calling me.

[BURR AND ENSEMBLE]
He's just
Non-stop!

[HAMILTON]
I practiced the law, I practic'ly perfected it
I've seen injustice in the world and I've corrected it
Now for a strong central democracy
If not, then I'll be Socrates

Throwing verbal rocks
At these mediocrities.

[ENSEMBLE]
Awww!

Hamilton, at the Constitutional Convention:

[HAMILTON]
I was chosen for the Constitutional Convention

[BURR]
There as a New York junior delegate:
[HAMILTON]
Now what I'm going to say may sound indelicate...

Goes and proposes his own form of government!

His own plan for a new form of government!

What?

What?

Is this a legal matter?

HAMILTON
Yes, and it's important to me

[BURR]
What do you need?

[HAMILTON]
Burr, you're a better lawyer than me

[BURR]
Okay

[HAMILTON]
I know I talk too much, I'm abrasive
You're incredible in court. You're succinct, persuasive
My client needs a strong defense. You're the solution

[BURR]
Who's your client?

[HAMILTON]
The new U.S. Constitution?

[BURR]
No

[HAMILTON]
Hear me out

[BURR]
No way!

A series of essays, anonymously published
Defending the document to the public

[BURR]
No one will read it

I disagree

[BURR]
And if it fails?

[HAMILTON]
Burr, that's why we need it

[BURR]
The constitution's a mess

[HAMILTON]
So it needs amendments

[BURR]
It's full of contradictions

[HAMILTON]
So is independence
We have to start somewhere

[BURR]
No. No way

[HAMILTON]
You're making a mistake

[BURR]
Good night

[HAMILTON]
Hey
What are you waiting for?
What do you stall for?

[BURR]
What?

[HAMILTON]
We won the war
What was it all for?
Do you support this constitution?

[BURR]
Of course

[HAMILTON]
Then defend it

[BURR]
And what if you're backing the wrong horse?

[HAMILTON]
Burr, we studied and we fought and we killed
For the notion of a nation we now get to build
For once in your life, take a stand with pride
I don't understand how you stand to the side

[BURR]
I'll keep all my plans
Close to my chest

I'll wait here and see
Which way the wind
Will blow
I'm taking my time
Watching the
Afterbirth of a nation
Watching the tension grow.

[ENSEMBLE]
Wait for it, wait for
It, wait...

Which way the wind
Will blow
I'm taking my time
Watching the
Afterbirth of a nation
Watching the tension grow.

If I could grant you peace of mind
Would that be enough?

[BURR]
Alexander joins forces with James Madison and John Jay to write a series of essays defending the new United States Constitution, entitled The Federalist Papers. The plan was to write a total of twenty-five essays, the work divided evenly among the three men. In the end, they wrote eighty-five essays, in the span of six months. John Jay got sick after writing five. James Madison wrote twenty-nine. Hamilton wrote the other fifty-one!

[BURR]
How do you write like you're
Running out of time?
Write day and night like you're

How does a bastard, orphan, son of a whore and a
Scotsman, dropped in the middle of a
Forgotten spot in the Caribbean by providence
Impoverished, in squalor
Grow up to be a hero and a scholar?

[LAURENS]
The ten-dollar founding father without a father
Got a lot farther by working a lot harder
By being a lot smarter
By being a self-starter
By fourteen, they placed him in charge of a
Trading charter

[JEFFERSON]
And every day while slaves were being slaughtered and carted
Away across the waves, he struggled and kept his guard up
Inside, he was longing for something to be a part of
The brother was ready to beg, steal, borrow, or barter

[MADISON]
Then a hurricane came, and devastation reigned
Our man saw his future drip, dripping down the drain
Put a pencil to his temple, connected it to his brain
And he wrote his first refrain, a testament to his pain

[BURR]
Well, the word got around, they said, "This kid is insane, man"
Took up a collection just to send him to the mainland
"Get your education, don't forget from whence you came, and
The world is gonna know your name. What's your name, man?"

[HAMILTON]
Alexander Hamilton
My name is Alexander Hamilton
And there's a million things I haven't done
But just you wait, just you wait...

[ELIZA]
When he was ten his father split, full of it, debt-ridden
Two years later, see Alex and his mother bed-ridden
Half-dead sittin in their own sick, the scent thick

[COMPANY]
And Alex got better but his mother went quick

[WASHINGTON]
Moved in with a cousin, the cousin committed suicide
Left him with nothin' but ruined pride, something new inside
A voice saying
[WASHINGTON]
"You gotta fend for yourself." [COMPANY]
"Alex, you gotta fend for yourself."

[WASHINGTON]
He started retreatin' and readin' every treatise on the shelf
[BURR]
There would have been nothin' left to do
For someone less astute
He woulda been dead or destitute
Without a cent of restitution
Started workin', clerkin' for his late mother's landlord
Tradin' sugar cane and rum and all the things he can't afford
Scammin' for every book he can get his hands on
Plannin' for the future see him now as he stands on
The bow of a ship headed for a new land
In New York you can be a new man

[COMPANY]
In New York you can
Be a new man-
In New York you can
Be a new man-

[COMPANY]
Scammin'

Plannin'
Oooh...

Oh, Alexander Hamilton

When America sings for you
Will they know what you overcame?
Will they know you rewrote the game?
The world will never be the same, oh

The ship is in the harbor now
See if you can spot him

Another immigrant
Comin' up from the bottom

His enemies destroyed his rep
America forgot him

Waiting in the wings for you

Aaron Burr, Sir

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[COMPANY]
1776. New York City

[HAMILTON]
Pardon me. Are you Aaron Burr, sir?

[BURR]
That depends. Who's asking?

[HAMILTON]
Oh, well, sure, sir
I'm Alexander Hamilton, I'm at your service, sir
I have been looking for you

[BURR]
I'm getting nervous

[HAMILTON]
Sir...
I heard your name at Princeton. I was seeking an accelerated course of study when I got sort of out of sorts with a buddy of yours. I may have punched him. It's a blur, sir. He handles the financials?

[BURR]
You punched the bursar

[HAMILTON]
Yes!
I wanted to do what you did. Graduate in two, then join the revolution. He looked at me like I was stupid, I'm not stupid

So how'd you do it? How'd you graduate so fast?

[BURR]
It was my parents' dying wish before they passed

[HAMILTON]
You're an orphan. Of course! I'm an orphan
God, I wish there was a war!
Then we could prove that we're worth more
Than anyone bargained for...

[BURR]
Can I buy you a drink?

[HAMILTON]
That would be nice

[BURR]
While we're talking, let me offer you some free advice
Talk less

[HAMILTON]
What?

[BURR]
Smile more

[HAMILTON]
Ha

[BURR]
Don't let them know what you're against or what you're for

[HAMILTON]
You can't be serious

[BURR]
You wanna get ahead?

[HAMILTON]
Yes

[BURR]
Fools who run their mouths off wind up dead

[LAURENS]
Yo yo yo yo yo!
What time is it?

[LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
Show time!

[BURR]
...like I said...

[LAURENS]
Show time! Show time! Yo!
I'm John Laurens in the place to be!
Two pints o' Sam Adams, but I'm workin' on three, uh!
Those redcoats don't want it with me!
Cuz I will pop chick-a pop these cops till I'm free!

[LAFAYETTE]
Oui oui, mon ami, je m'appelle Lafayette!
The Lancelot of the revolutionary set!
I came from afar just to say "Bonsoir!"
Tell the King "Casse toi!" Who's the best?
C'est moi!

[MULLIGAN]
Brrrah brraaah! I am Hercules Mulligan
Up in it, lovin' it, yes I heard ya mother said "Come again?"
Lock up ya daughters and horses, of course
It's hard to have intercourse over four sets of corsets...

[LAURENS]
No more sex, pour me another brew, son!
Let's raise a couple more...

[LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
To the revolution!

[LAURENS]
Well, if it ain't the prodigy of Princeton college!

[MULLIGAN]
Aaron Burr!

[LAURENS]
Give us a verse, drop some knowledge!

[BURR]
Good luck with that: you're takin' a stand
You spit. I'm ‘a sit. We'll see where we land

[LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
Boooo!

[LAURENS]
Burr, the revolution's imminent. What do you stall for?

[HAMILTON]
If you stand for nothing, Burr, what'll you fall for?
[LAURENS]
Ooh
Who are you? [MULLIGAN]
Ooh

Who are you? [LAFAYETTE]
Ooh

Who are you?

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE/LAURENS]
Ooh, who is this kid? What's he gonna do?

My Shot

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[HAMILTON]
I am not throwing away my shot!
I am not throwing away my shot!
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot!
I'm ‘a get a scholarship to King's College
I prob'ly shouldn't brag, but dag, I amaze and astonish
The problem is I got a lot of brains but no polish
I gotta holler just to be heard
With every word, I drop knowledge!
I'm a diamond in the rough, a shiny piece of coal
Tryin' to reach my goal. My power of speech: unimpeachable
Only nineteen but my mind is older
These New York City streets get colder, I shoulder
Ev'ry burden, ev'ry disadvantage
I have learned to manage, I don't have a gun to brandish
I walk these streets famished
The plan is to fan this spark into a flame
But damn, it's getting dark, so let me spell out the name
I am the-

[HAMILTON/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN/LAURENS]
A-L-E-X-A-N-D
E-R-we are-meant to be...

[HAMILTON]
A colony that runs independently
Meanwhile, Britain keeps shittin' on us endlessly
Essentially, they tax us relentlessly
Then King George turns around, runs a spending spree
He ain't ever gonna set his descendants free
So there will be a revolution in this century
Enter me!

[LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN/LAURENS]
(He says in parentheses)

[HAMILTON]
Don't be shocked when your hist'ry book mentions me
I will lay down my life if it sets us free
Eventually, you'll see my ascendancy
[HAMILTON]
And I am not throwing away
My shot
I am not throwing away
My shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot
[LAURENS]
My shot!

My shot!

And I'm not throwing away my shot.

[HAMILTON/MULLIGAN/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE]
I am not throwing away my shot
I am not throwing away my shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot
It's time to take a shot!

[LAFAYETTE]
I dream of life without a monarchy
The unrest in France will lead to ‘onarchy?
‘Onarchy? How you say, how you say, ‘anarchy?'
When I fight, I make the other side panicky
With my-

[HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
Shot!

[MULLIGAN]
Yo, I'm a tailor's apprentice
And I got y'all knuckleheads in loco parentis
I'm joining the rebellion cuz I know it's my chance
To socially advance, instead of sewin' some pants!
I'm gonna take a-

[HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
Shot!

[LAURENS]
But we'll never be truly free
Until those in bondage have the same rights as you and me
You and I. Do or die. Wait till I sally in
On a stallion with the first black battalion
Have another-

[HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
Shot!

[BURR]
Geniuses, lower your voices
You keep out of trouble and you double your choices
I'm with you, but the situation is fraught
You've got to be carefully taught:
If you talk, you're gonna get shot!

[HAMILTON]
Burr, check what we got
Mister Lafayette, hard rock like Lancelot
I think your pants look hot
Laurens, I like you a lot
Let's hatch a plot blacker than the kettle callin' the pot...
What are the odds the gods would put us all in one spot
Poppin' a squat on conventional wisdom, like it or not
A bunch of revolutionary manumission abolitionists?
Give me a position, show me where the ammunition is!

Oh, am I talkin' too loud?
Sometimes I get over excited, shoot off at the mouth
I never had a group of friends before
I promise that I'll make y'all proud

[LAURENS]
Let's get this guy in front of a crowd

[HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN/ENSEMBLE]
I am not throwing away my shot
I am not throwing away my shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot

I am not throwing away my shot
I am not throwing away my shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot
[LAURENS]
Ev'rybody sing:
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Hey!
Whoa!
Wooh!!
Whoa!
Ay, let ‘em hear ya!

Let's go!

I said shout it to the rooftops!
Said, to the rooftops!
Come on!

MULLIGAN]
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

Whoa!

Whoa!

Yea!

[COMPANY]
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

[LAURENS]
Rise up!
When you're living on your knees, you rise up
Tell your brother that he's gotta rise up
Tell your sister that she's gotta rise up
[LAURENS AND ENSEMBLE]
When are these colonies gonna rise up?
When are these colonies gonna rise up?
When are these colonies gonna rise up?
When are these colonies gonna rise up?

Rise up!
[COMPANY]
Whoa! Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!

Rise up!

[HAMILTON]
I imagine death so much it feels more like a memory
When's it gonna get me?
In my sleep? Seven feet ahead of me?
If I see it comin', do I run or do I let it be?
Is it like a beat without a melody?
See, I never thought I'd live past twenty
Where I come from some get half as many
Ask anybody why we livin' fast and we laugh, reach for a flask
We have to make this moment last, that's plenty

Scratch that
This is not a moment, it's the movement
Where all the hungriest brothers with
Something to prove went?
Foes oppose us, we take an honest stand
We roll like Moses, claimin' our promised land
And? If we win our independence?
‘Zat a guarantee of freedom for our descendants?
Or will the blood we shed begin an endless
Cycle of vengeance and death with no defendants?
I know the action in the street is excitin'
But Jesus, between all the bleedin' ‘n fightin'
I've been readin' ‘n writin'
We need to handle our financial situation
Are we a nation of states? What's the state of our nation?
I'm past patiently waitin'. I'm passionately
Smashin' every expectation
Every action's an act of creation!
I'm laughin' in the face of casualties and sorrow
For the first time, I'm thinkin' past tomorrow

[HAMILTON AND COMPANY]
And I am not throwing away my shot
I am not throwing away my shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot

There's nothing rich folks love more

They pull up in their carriages and gawk
At the students in the common

His daughters, Peggy, Angelica, Eliza

You searchin for an urchin who can give you ideals?

Ah, so you've discussed me

Farmer Refuted

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[SEABURY]
Hear ye, hear ye! My name is Samuel Seabury
And I present "Free Thoughts on the
Proceedings of the Continental Congress!"
Heed not the rabble who scream revolution
They have not your interests at heart

[MULLIGAN]
Oh my God. Tear this dude apart

[SEABURY]
Chaos and bloodshed are not a solution
Don't let them lead you astray
This Congress does not speak for me

[BURR]
Let him be

[SEABURY]
They're playing a dangerous game
I pray the king shows you his mercy
For shame, for shame...
[HAMILTON]
Yo!
He'd have you all unravel at the
Sound of screams but the
Revolution is comin'
The have-nots are gonna
Win this
It's hard to listen to you with a straight face

Chaos and bloodshed already haunt us, honestly you shouldn't even talk. And what about Boston? Look at the cost, n' all that we've lost n' you talk
About Congress?!

My dog speaks more eloquently than thee!

But strangely, your mange is the same

Is he in Jersey?

For the revolution!
[SEABURY]
Heed not the rabble
Who scream
Revolution, they
Have not your
Interests
At heart

Chaos and bloodshed are
Not a
Solution. Don't
Let them lead you
Astray
This Congress does not
Speak for me

They're playing a dangerous game

I pray the king shows you his mercy

For shame

For shame,

[COMPANY]
For the revolution!

[SEABURY]
Heed-

[HAMILTON]
If you repeat yourself again I'm gonna-

[SEABURY/HAMILTON]
Scream-

[HAMILTON]
Honestly, look at me, please don't read!

[SEABURY]
Not your interests-

[HAMILTON]
Don't modulate the key then not debate with me!
Why should a tiny island across the sea regulate the price of tea?

[BURR]
Alexander, please!

[HAMILTON]
Burr, I'd rather be divisive than indecisive, drop the niceties

Silence! A message from the King!

You'll Be Back

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[KING GEORGE]
You say
The price of my love's not a price that you're willing to pay
You cry
In your tea which you hurl in the sea when you see me go by
Why so sad?
Remember we made an arrangement when you went away
Now you're making me mad
Remember, despite our estrangement, I'm your man
You'll be back
Soon you'll see
You'll remember you belong to me
You'll be back
Time will tell
You'll remember that I served you well
Oceans rise
Empires fall
We have seen each other through it all
And when push
Comes to shove
I will send a fully armed battalion
To remind you of my love!

Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da
Da da dat dat da ya da!
Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da
Da da dat dat da...

You say our love is draining and you can't go on
You'll be the one complaining when I am gone...
And no, don't change the subject
Cuz you're my favorite subject
My sweet, submissive subject
My loyal, royal subject
Forever and ever and ever and ever and ever...

You'll be back
Like before
I will fight the fight and win the war
For your love
For your praise
And I'll love you till my dying days
When you're gone
I'll go mad
So don't throw away this thing we had

Cuz when push comes to shove
I will kill your friends and family to remind you of my love
Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da
Da da dat dat da ya da!
Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da
Da da dat-
Everybody!

[ENSEMBLE]
Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da
Da da dat dat da ya da!
Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da da da da

Now I'm the model of a modern major general
The venerated Virginian veteran whose men are all
Lining up, to put me up on a pedestal
Writin' letters to relatives
Embellishin' my elegance and eloquence
But the elephant is in the room
The truth is in ya face when ya hear the British cannons go...

Any hope of success is fleeting
How can I keep leading when the people I'm
Leading keep retreating?
We put a stop to the bleeding as the British take Brooklyn
Knight takes rook, but look

My forces, they're skittish as the British cut the city up
This close to giving up, facing mad scrutiny
I scream in the face of this mass mutiny:
Are these the men with which I am to defend America?
We ride at midnight, Manhattan in the distance
I cannot be everywhere at once, people
I'm in dire need of assistance...

[BURR]
Your excellency, sir!

[WASHINGTON]
Who are you?

[BURR]
Aaron Burr, Sir?
Permission to state my case?

[WASHINGTON]
As you were

[BURR]
Sir
I was a captain under General Montgomery
Until he caught a bullet in the neck in Quebec
And well, in summary
I think that I could be of some assistance
I admire how you keep firing on the British
From a distance

[WASHINGTON]
Huh

[BURR]
I have some questions, a couple of suggestions on how to fight instead of fleeing west

[WASHINGTON]
Yes?

[BURR]
Well-

[HAMILTON]
Your excellency, you wanted to see me?

[WASHINGTON]
Hamilton, come in, have you met Burr?

[HAMILTON]
Yes, sir

[HAMILTON AND BURR]
We keep meeting

[BURR]
As I was saying, sir, I look forward to seeing your strategy play out

[WASHINGTON]
Burr?

[BURR]
Sir?

[WASHINGTON]
Close the door on your way out

[HAMILTON]
Have I done something wrong, sir?

[WASHINGTON]
On the contrary
I called you here because our odds are beyond scary
Your reputation precedes you, but I have to laugh

[HAMILTON]
Sir?

[WASHINGTON]
Hamilton, how come no one can get you on their staff?

[HAMILTON]
Sir!

[WASHINGTON]
Don't get me wrong, you're a young man, of great renown
I know you stole British cannons when we were still downtown
Nathaniel Green and Henry Knox wanted to hire you...

[HAMILTON]
To be their Secretary? I don't think so

[WASHINGTON]
Why're you upset?

[HAMILTON]
I'm not-

[WASHINGTON]
It's alright, you want to fight, you've got a hunger
I was just like you when I was younger
Head full of fantasies of dyin' like a martyr?

[HAMILTON]
Yes

[WASHINGTON]
Dying is easy, young man. Living is harder

[HAMILTON]
Why are you telling me this?

[WASHINGTON]
I'm being honest
I'm working with a third of what our Congress has promised
We are a powder keg about to explode
I need someone like you to lighten the load. So?

[COMPANY (EXCEPT HAMILTON)]
I am not throwin' away my shot!
I am not throwin' away my shot!
Ayo, I'm just like my country, I'm young
Scrappy and hungry!

[HAMILTON]
I am not throwing away my shot!

[WASHINGTON]
Son

[WASHINGON AND COMPANY]
We are outgunned, outmanned!

[HAMILTON]
You need all the help you can get
I have some friends. Laurens, Mulligan
Marquis de Lafayette, okay, what else?

[WASHINGTON AND COMPANY]
Outnumbered, outplanned!

[HAMILTON]
We'll need some spies on the inside
Some King's men who might let some things slide
[HAMILTON]
I'll write to Congress and tell ‘em we need supplies, you rally the guys, master the element of surprise

I'll rise above my station, organize your information, ‘til we rise to the occasion of our new nation. Sir!

[ENSEMBLE]
Here comes the General!

[HAMILTON]
Rise up!

[HAMILTON]
Rise up!

[ENSEMBLE]
Here comes the General!

[HAMILTON]
Rise up! [COMPANY]
Boom!

A Winter's Ball

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[BURR]
How does the bastard, orphan, son of a whore
Go on and on
Grow into more of a phenomenon?
Watch this obnoxious, arrogant, loudmouth bother
Be seated at the right hand of the father
Washington hires Hamilton right on sight
But Hamilton still wants to fight, not write
Now Hamilton's skill with a quill is undeniable
But what do we have in common? We're
Reliable with the

[ALL MEN]
Ladies!

[BURR]
There are so many to deflower!

[ALL MEN]
Ladies!

[BURR]
Looks! Proximity to power

[ALL MEN]
Ladies!

[BURR]
They delighted and distracted him
Martha Washington named her feral tomcat after him!

[HAMILTON]
That's true

[FULL COMPANY]
1780

[BURR]
A winter's ball
And the Schuyler sisters are the envy of all
Yo, if you can marry a sister, you're rich, son

[HAMILTON]
Is it a question of if, Burr, or which one?

Helpless

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[HAMILTON/BURR/LAURENS/ALL WOMEN (EXCEPT ELIZA)]
Hey hey hey hey
[ELIZA]
Ohh, I do I do I do I
Dooo! Hey!
Ohh, I do I do I do I
Dooo! Boy you got me [ALL WOMEN]
Hey hey hey hey
Hey hey hey hey
Hey hey hey hey
Hey hey hey

[ELIZA AND WOMEN]
Helpless!
Look into your eyes, and the sky's the limit I'm helpless!
Down for the count, and I'm drownin' in ‘em

[ELIZA]
I have never been the type to try and grab the spotlight
We were at a revel with some rebels on a hot night
Laughin' at my sister as she's dazzling the room
Then you walked in and my heart went "Boom!"
Tryin' to catch your eye from the side of the ballroom
Everybody's dancin' and the band's top volume

[ELIZA AND WOMEN]
Grind to the rhythm as we wine and dine
[ELIZA]
Grab my sister, and
Whisper, "Yo, this
One's mine."

My sister made her way across the room to you
And I got nervous, thinking "What's she gonna do?"
She grabbed you by the arm, I'm thinkin' "I'm through"
Then you look back at me and suddenly I'm
Helpless!

Oh, look at those eyes

Oh!
Yeah, I'm
Helpless, I know

I'm so into you
I am so into you

I know I'm down for the count
And I'm drownin' in ‘em.

[ALL WOMEN]
Oooh

Oooh

Oooh

Oooh

Helpless!

Look into your eyes
And the sky's the limit
I'm
Helpless!
Down for the count
And I'm drownin' in ‘em

I'm helpless!

Look into your eyes
And the sky's the limit I'm helpless!

Down for the count
And I'm drownin' in ‘em.

[HAMILTON]
Where are you taking me?

[ANGELICA]
I'm about to change your life

[HAMILTON]
Then by all means, lead the way

[ELIZA]
Elizabeth Schuyler. It's a pleasure to meet you

[HAMILTON]
Schuyler?

[ANGELICA]
My sister

[ELIZA]
Thank you for all your service

[HAMILTON]
If it takes fighting a war for us to meet, it will have been worth it

[ANGELICA]
I'll leave you to it

[ELIZA AND WOMEN]
One week later

[ELIZA]
I'm writin' a letter nightly
Now my life gets better, every letter that you write me
Laughin' at my sister, cuz she wants to form a harem

[ANGELICA]
I'm just sayin', if you really loved me, you would share him
[ELIZA]
Ha!
Two weeks later
In the living room stressin'
My father's stone-faced
While you're asking for his blessin'
I'm dying inside, as
You wine
And dine
And I'm tryin' not to cry
‘cause there's nothing that your mind can't do
My father makes his way across the room
To you
I panic for a second, thinking
"we're through"
But then he shakes your hand and says
"Be true"
And you turn back to me, smiling, and I'm
Helpless!

Helpless!
Hoo!

That boy is mine
That boy is mine!

Helpless! Helpless!
Down for the count
And I'm drownin' in em

[ALL WOMEN]
Stressin'

Blessin'

Oooh

Oooh

Oooh

Oooh

Helpless!
Look into your eyes
And the sky's the
Limit I'm
Helpless!
Down for the count
And I'm drownin' in
‘em I'm
Helpless!

Look into your eyes
And the sky's the
Limit I'm
Helpless!
Down for the count
And I'm drownin' in em

[HAMILTON]
Eliza, I don't have a dollar to my name
An acre of land, a troop to command, a dollop of fame
All I have's my honor, a tolerance for pain
A couple of college credits and my top-notch brain
Insane, your family brings out a different side of me
Peggy confides in me, Angelica tried to take a bite of me
No stress, my love for you is never in doubt
We'll get a little place in Harlem and we'll figure it out
I've been livin' without a family since I was a child
My father left, my mother died, I grew up buckwild
But I'll never forget my mother's face, that was real
And long as I'm alive, Eliza, swear to God
You'll never feel so...

[HAMILTON]
Eliza...

I've never felt so-

My life is gon' be fine cuz Eliza's in it.
[ELIZA]
I do I do I do I do!

I do I do I do I do!

Hey, yeah, yeah!

I'm down for the count
I'm-

I look into your eyes, and the sky's the limit
I'm

...drownin' in ‘em. [ALL WOMEN]
Helpless!

Helpless!

Helpless!

Down for the count
And I'm drownin' in ‘em

Helpless!

Helpless!

Helpless!

Down for the count
And I'm drownin' in ‘em.

Satisfied

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[LAURENS]
Alright, alright. That's what I'm talkin' about!
Now everyone give it up for the maid of honor
Angelica Schuyler!
[ANGELICA]
A toast to the groom!

To the bride!

From your sister

Who is always by your side

To your union

And the hope that you provide

May you always...

Be satisfied.

[ALL MEN]
To the groom!
To the groom!
To the groom!

To the bride!
To the bride!

Angelica!
Angelica!
Angelica!

By your side!

To the union!
To the revolution!

You provide!
You provide!

[HAMILTON AND MEN]
Always-

Rewind-

[ALL WOMEN]
To the groom!

To the bride!

To the bride!

[ELIZA AND WOMEN]
Angelica!

By your side!

To the union!
To the revolution!

You provide!

Always-

Rewind-

[ANGELICA]
I remember that night, I just might
Regret that night for the rest of my days

I remember those soldier boys
Tripping over themselves to win our praise

I remember that dreamlike candlelight
Like a dream that you can't quite place

But Alexander, I'll never forget the first
Time I saw your face

I have never been the same
Intelligent eyes in a hunger-pang frame
And when you said "Hi," I forgot my dang name
Set my heart aflame, ev'ry part aflame

[FULL COMPANY]
This is not a game...

[HAMILTON]
You strike me as a woman who has never been satisfied

[ANGELICA]
I'm sure I don't know what you mean. You forget yourself

[HAMILTON]
You're like me. I'm never satisfied

[ANGELICA]
Is that right?

[HAMILTON]
I have never been satisfied

[ANGELICA]
My name is Angelica Schuyler

[HAMILTON]
Alexander Hamilton

[ANGELICA]
Where's your fam'ly from?

[HAMILTON]
Unimportant. There's a million things I haven't done but
Just you wait, just you wait...

[ANGELICA]
So so so-
So this is what it feels like to match wits
With someone at your level! What the hell is the catch? It's
The feeling of freedom, of seein' the light
It's Ben Franklin with a key and a kite! You see it, right?
The conversation lasted two minutes, maybe three minutes
Ev'rything we said in total agreement, it's
A dream and it's a bit of a dance
A bit of a posture, it's a bit of a stance. He's a
Bit of a flirt, but I'm ‘a give it a chance
I asked about his fam'ly, did you see his answer?
His hands started fidgeting, he looked askance?
He's penniless, he's flying by the seat of his pants

Handsome, boy, does he know it!
Peach fuzz, and he can't even grow it!
I wanna take him far away from this place
Then I turn and see my sister's face and she is...

[ELIZA]
Helpless...

[ANGELICA]
And I know she is...

[ELIZA]
Helpless...

[ANGELICA]
And her eyes are just...

[ELIZA]
Helpless...

[ANGELICA]
And I realize

[ANGELICA AND COMPANY]
Three fundamental truths at the exact same time...

[HAMILTON]
Where are you taking me?

[ANGELICA]
I'm about to change your life

[HAMILTON]
Then by all means, lead the way

[COMPANY (EXCEPT ANGELICA)]
Number one!

[ANGELICA]
I'm a girl in a world in which
My only job is to marry rich
My father has no sons so I'm the one
Who has to social climb for one
So I'm the oldest and the wittiest and the gossip in
New York City is insidious
Alexander is penniless
Ha! That doesn't mean I want him any less

[ELIZA]
Elizabeth Schuyler. It's a pleasure to meet you

[HAMILTON]
Schuyler?

[ANGELICA]
My sister

[COMPANY]
Number two!

[ANGELICA]
He's after me cuz I'm a Schuyler sister
That elevates his status, I'd
Have to be naïve to set that aside
Maybe that is why I introduce him to Eliza
Now that's his bride
Nice going, Angelica, he was right
You will never be satisfied

[ELIZA]
Thank you for all your service

[HAMILTON]
If it takes fighting a war for us to meet, it will have been worth it

[ANGELICA]
I'll leave you to it

[COMPANY]
Number three!

[ANGELICA]
I know my sister like I know my own mind
You will never find anyone as trusting or as kind
If I tell her that I love him she'd be silently resigned
He'd be mine
She would say, "I'm fine"

[ANGELICA AND COMPANY]
She'd be lying

[ANGELICA]
But when I fantasize at night
It's Alexander's eyes
As I romanticize what might
Have been if I hadn't sized him
Up so quickly
At least my dear Eliza's his wife;
At least I keep his eyes in my life...
[ANGELICA]
To the groom!

To the bride!

From your sister

Who is always by your side

To your union

And the hope that you provide

May you always

Be satisfied

And I know

She'll be happy as

His bride
And I know [ALL MEN (EXCEPT HAMILTON)]
To the groom!
To the groom!
To the groom!

To the bride!
To the bride!

Angelica!
Angelica!

By your side

To the union!
To the revolution!

You provide!
You provide!

[HAMILTON AND MEN]
Always-

Be satisfied

Be satisfied

[MEN]
Be satisfied
Be satisfied
Be satisfied
Be satisfied

Be satisfied
Be satisfied

Be satisfied
Be satisfied
Be satisfied
Be satisfied.

[ALL WOMEN (EXCEPT ELIZA)]
To the groom!

To the bride!

To the bride!

[ELIZA AND WOMEN]
Angelica!

By your side

To the union!
To the revolution!

You provide!

Always-

Be satisfied

[WOMEN]
Be satisfied

The Story of Tonight (Reprise)

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[LAURENS]
I may not live to see our glory!

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE]
I may not live to see our glory!

[LAURENS]
But I've seen wonders great and small

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE]
I've seen wonders great and small

[LAURENS]
‘Cause if the tomcat can get married

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE]
If Alexander can get married-

[LAURENS]
There's hope for our ass, after all!

[LAFAYETTE]
Raise a glass to freedom

[LAURENS/MULLIGAN]
Hey!
Something you will never see again!

[MULLIGAN]
No matter what she tells you

[LAFAYETTE]
Let's have another round tonight!

[LAURENS]
Raise a glass to the four of us!

[LAFAYETTE/HAMILTON]
Ho!

[MULLIGAN]
To the newly not poor of us!

[LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/HAMILTON]
Woo!

[LAFAYETTE]
We'll tell the story of tonight

[LAURENS]
Let's have another round-

[HAMILTON]
Well, if it isn't Aaron Burr

[BURR]
Sir!

[HAMILTON]
I didn't think that you would make it

[BURR]
To be sure

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE]
Burr!

[BURR]
I came to say congratulations

[MULLIGAN]
Spit a verse, Burr!

[BURR]
I see the whole gang is here

[LAFAYETTE]
You are the worst, Burr!

[HAMILTON]
Ignore them. Congrats to you, Lieutenant Colonel
I wish I had your command instead of manning George's journal

[BURR]
No, you don't

[HAMILTON]
Yes, I do

[BURR]
Now, be sensible
From what I hear, you've made yourself indispensable

[LAURENS]
Well, well, I heard
You've got a special someone on the side, Burr

[HAMILTON]
Is that so?

[LAURENS]
What are you tryin' to hide, Burr?

[BURR]
I should go

[HAMILTON]
No, these guys should go

[LAFAYETTE]
What?

[LAURENS]
No!

[HAMILTON]
Leave us alone

[MULLIGAN]
Man...

[HAMILTON]
It's alright, Burr. I wish you'd brought this girl with you tonight, Burr

[BURR]
You're very kind, but I'm afraid it's unlawful, sir

[HAMILTON]
What do you mean?

[BURR]
She's married

[HAMILTON]
I see

[BURR]
She's married to a British officer

[HAMILTON]
Oh shit...

[BURR]
Congrats again, Alexander. Smile more
I'll see you on the other side of the war

[HAMILTON]
I will never understand you
If you love this woman, go get her! What are you waiting for?

[BURR]
I'll see you on the other side of the war

[HAMILTON]
I'll see you on the other side of the war

Wait For It

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[BURR]
Theodosia writes me a letter everyday
I'm keeping the bed warm while her husband is away
He's on the British side in Georgia
He's trying to keep the colonies in line
But he can keep all of Georgia
Theodosia, she's mine

Love doesn't discriminate
Between the sinners
And the saints
It takes and it takes and it takes
And we keep loving anyway
We laugh and we cry
And we break
And we make our mistakes
And if there's a reason I'm by her side
When so many have tried
Then I'm willing to wait for it
I'm willing to wait for it
[BURR]
My grandfather was a fire and brimstone preacher

But there are things that the
Homilies and hymns won't teach ya

My mother was a genius

My father commanded respect

When they died they left no instructions
Just a legacy to protect

[MEN]
Preacher, preacher
Preacher

Teach ya, teach ya, teach ya

Respect, respect

Genius

Death doesn't discriminate
Between the sinners
And the saints

And we keep living anyway

When everyone who loves me has died
I'm willing to wait for it
I'm willing to wait for it

And if there's a reason
He seems to thrive when so few survive, then Goddamnit-

I'm willing to wait for it...

Stay Alive

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[ELIZA]
Stay alive...

[ELIZA/ANGELICA/ENSEMBLE WOMEN]
Stay alive...

[HAMILTON]
I have never seen the General so despondent
I have taken over writing all his correspondence
Congress writes, "George, attack the British forces."
I shoot back, we have resorted to eating our horses
Local merchants deny us equipment, assistance
They only take British money, so sing a song of sixpence

[WASHINGTON]
The cavalry's not coming

[HAMILTON]
Sir!

[WASHINGTON]
Alex, listen. There's only one way for us to win this
Provoke outrage, outright

[HAMILTON]
That's right

[WASHINGTON]
Don't engage, strike by night
Remain relentless ‘til their troops take flight

[HAMILTON]
Make it impossible to justify the cost of the fight

[WASHINGTON]
Outrun

[HAMILTON]
Outrun

[WASHINGTON]
Outlast

[HAMILTON]
Outlast

[WASHINGTON]
Hit ‘em quick, get out fast

[HAMILTON]
Chick-a-plao!

[WASHINGTON]
Stay alive ‘til this horror show is past
We're gonna fly a lot of flags half-mast

[HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE]
Raise a glass!

[MULLIGAN]
I go back to New York and my apprenticeship

[LAFAYETTE]
I ask for French aid, I pray that France has sent a ship

[LAURENS]
I stay at work with Hamilton
We write essays against slavery
And every day's a test of our camaraderie
And bravery

[HAMILTON]
We cut supply lines, we steal contraband
We pick and choose our battles and places to take a stand
And ev'ry day
"Sir, entrust me with a command,"
And ev'ry day

[WASHINGTON]
No

[HAMILTON]
He dismisses me out of hand
[HAMILTON]
Instead of me
He promotes
Charles Lee
Makes him second-in-command:

[LEE]
Charles Lee. [ELIZA/ANGELICA]
Stay alive...

[LEE]
I'm a General. Whee!!!!

[HAMILTON]
Yeah. He's not the choice I would have gone with

[HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE]
He shits the bed at the Battle of Monmouth

[WASHINGTON]
Ev'ryone attack!

[LEE]
Retreat!

[WASHINGTON]
Attack!

[LEE]
Retreat!

[WASHINGTON]
What are you doing, Lee? Get back on your feet!

[LEE]
But there's so many of them!

[WASHINGTON]
I'm sorry, is this not your speed?!
Hamilton!

[HAMILTON]
Ready, sir!

[WASHINGTON]
Have Lafayette take the lead!

[HAMILTON]
Yes, sir!

[LAURENS]
A thousand soldiers die in a hundred degree heat

[LAFAYETTE]
As we snatch a stalemate from the jaws of defeat

[HAMILTON]
Charles Lee was left behind
Without a pot to piss in
He started sayin' this to anybody who would listen:

[LEE]
Washington cannot be left alone to his devices
Indecisive, from crisis to crisis
The best thing he can do for the revolution
Is turn n' go back to plantin' tobacco in Mount Vernon

[COMPANY]
Oo!!

[WASHINGTON]
Don't do a thing. History will prove him wrong

[HAMILTON]
But, sir!

[WASHINGTON]
We have a war to fight, let's move along

[LAURENS]
Strong words from Lee, someone oughta hold him to it

[HAMILTON]
I can't disobey direct orders

[LAURENS]
Then I'll do it
Alexander, you're the closest friend I've got

[HAMILTON]
Laurens, do not throw away your shot

Ten Duel Commandments

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[MEN]
One, two, three, four

[FULL COMPANY]
Five, six, seven, eight, nine...

[BURR/HAMILTON/LAURENS/LEE]
It's the Ten Duel Commandments

[FULL COMPANY]
It's the Ten Duel Commandments
Number one!

[LAURENS]
The challenge: demand satisfaction
If they apologize, no need for further action

[COMPANY]
Number two!

[LAURENS]
If they don't, grab a friend, that's your second

[HAMILTON]
Your lieutenant when there's reckoning to be reckoned

[COMPANY]
Number three!

[LEE]
Have your seconds meet face to face

[BURR]
Negotiate a peace...

[HAMILTON]
Or negotiate a time and place

[BURR]
This is commonplace, ‘specially ‘tween recruits

[COMPANY]
Most disputes die, and no one shoots
Number four!

[LAURENS]
If they don't reach a peace, that's alright
Time to get some pistols and a doctor on site

[HAMILTON]
You pay him in advance, you treat him with civility

[BURR]
You have him turn around so he can have deniability

Duel before the sun is in the sky

Leave a note for your next of kin
Tell ‘em where you been. Pray that hell or heaven lets you in

[BURR]
Alexander

[HAMILTON]
Aaron Burr, sir

[BURR]
Can we agree that duels are dumb and immature?

[HAMILTON]
Sure
But your man has to answer for his words, Burr

[BURR]
With his life? We both know that's absurd, sir

[HAMILTON]
Hang on, how many men died because Lee was inexperienced and ruinous?

[BURR]
Okay, so we're doin' this

Meet Me Inside

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[HAMILTON]
Lee, do you yield?

[BURR]
You shot him in the side!
Yes, he yields!

[LAURENS]
I'm satisfied

[BURR]
Yo, we gotta clear the field!

[HAMILTON]
Go! We won

[COMPANY]
Here comes the General!

[BURR]
This should be fun

[WASHINGTON]
What is the meaning of this? Mr. Burr, get a medic for the General

[BURR]
Yes, sir

[WASHINGTON]
Lee, you will never agree with me
But believe me, these young men don't speak for me
Thank you for your service

[BURR]
Let's ride!

[WASHINGTON]
Hamilton!

[HAMILTON]
Sir!

[WASHINGTON]
Meet me inside

[COMPANY]
Meet him inside! Meet him inside!
Meet him inside, meet him, meet him inside!

[WASHINGTON]
Son-

[HAMILTON]
Don't call me son

[WASHINGTON]
This war is hard enough
Without infighting-

[HAMILTON]
Lee called you out. We called his bluff

[WASHINGTON]
You solve nothing, you aggravate our allies to the south

[HAMILTON]
You're absolutely right, John should have shot him in the mouth
That would've shut him up

[WASHINGTON]
Son-

[HAMILTON]
I'm notcha son-

[WASHINGTON]
Watch your tone
I am not a maiden in need of defending, I am grown

[HAMILTON (OVERLAPPING)]
Charles Lee, Thomas Conway
These men take your name and they rake it
Through the mud

[WASHINGTON]
My name's been through a lot, I can take it

[HAMILTON]
Well, I don't have your name. I don't have your titles
I don't have your land
But, if you-

[WASHINGTON]
No-

[HAMILTON]
If you gave me command of a battalion, a group of men to lead, I could fly above my station after the war

[WASHINGTON]
Or you could die and we need you alive

[HAMILTON]
I'm more than willing to die-

[WASHINGTON]
Your wife needs you alive, son, I need you alive-

[HAMILTON]
Call me son one more time-

[WASHINGTON]
Go home, Alexander
That's an order from your commander

[HAMILTON]
Sir-

[WASHINGTON]
Go home

That Would Be Enough

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[ELIZA]
Look around, look around at how lucky we are
To be alive right now
Look around, look around...

[HAMILTON]
How long have you known?

[ELIZA]
A month or so

[HAMILTON]
Eliza, you should have told me

[ELIZA]
I wrote to the General a month ago

[HAMILTON]
No

[ELIZA]
I begged him to send you home

[HAMILTON]
You should have told me

[ELIZA]
I'm not sorry
[ELIZA]
I knew you'd fight
Until the war was won

But you deserve a chance to meet your son
Look around, look around at how lucky we are
To be alive right now.
[HAMILTON]
The war's not
Done.

[HAMILTON]
Will you relish being a poor man's wife
Unable to provide for your life?

[ELIZA]
I relish being your wife
Look around, look around...

Look at where you are
Look at where you started
The fact that you're alive is a miracle
Just stay alive, that would be enough

And if this child
Shares a fraction of your smile
Or a fragment of your mind, look out world!
That would be enough

I don't pretend to know
The challenges you're facing
The worlds you keep erasing and creating in your mind

But I'm not afraid
I know who I married
So long as you come home at the end of the day
That would be enough

We don't need a legacy
We don't need money
If I could grant you peace of mind

If you could let me inside your heart...
Oh, let me be a part of the narrative
In the story they will write someday
Let this moment be the first chapter:
Where you decide to stay
And I could be enough
And we could be enough
That would be enough

Guns and Ships

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[BURR]
How does a ragtag volunteer army in need of a shower
Somehow defeat a global superpower?
How do we emerge victorious from the quagmire?
Leave the battlefield waving Betsy Ross' flag higher?
Yo. Turns out we have a secret weapon!
An immigrant you know and love who's unafraid to step in!
He's constantly confusin', confoundin' the British henchmen
Ev'ryone give it up for America's favorite fighting Frenchman!

[COMPANY]
Lafayette!

[LAFAYETTE]
I'm takin this horse by the reins makin'
Redcoats redder with bloodstains

[COMPANY]
Lafayette!

[LAFAYETTE]
And I'm never gonna stop until I make ‘em
Drop and burn ‘em up and scatter their remains, I'm

[COMPANY]
Lafayette!

[LAFAYETTE]
Watch me engagin' em! Escapin' em!
Enragin' em! I'm-

[COMPANY]
Lafayette!

[LAFAYETTE]
I go to France for more funds

[COMPANY]
Lafayette!

[LAFAYETTE]
I come back with more

[LAFAYETTE AND ENSEMBLE]
Guns
And ships
And so the balance shifts

[WASHINGTON]
We rendezvous with Rochambeau, consolidate their gifts

[LAFAYETTE]
We can end this war at Yorktown, cut them off at sea, but
For this to succeed, there's someone else we need:

[WASHINGTON]
I know

[WASHINGTON AND COMPANY]
Hamilton!

[LAFAYETTE]
Sir, he knows what to do in a trench
Ingenuitive and fluent in French, ami-

[WASHINGTON AND COMPANY]
Hamilton!

[LAFAYETTE]
Sir, you're gonna have to use him eventually
What's he gonna do on the bench? I mean-

[WASHINGTON AND COMPANY]
Hamilton!

[LAFAYETTE]
No one has more resilience
Or matches my practical tactical brilliance-

[WASHINGTON AND COMPANY]
Hamilton!
[LAFAYETTE]
You wanna fight for your land back?

[WASHINGTON]
I need my right hand man back!

[LAFAYETTE]
Ah! Uh, get ya right hand man back
You know you gotta get ya right hand man back

I mean you gotta put some thought into the letter but the sooner the better
To get your right hand man back!

[COMPANY]
Hamilton!

[WOMEN]

[WASHINGTON]
Alexander Hamilton
Troops are waiting in the field for you
If you join us right now, together we can turn the tide
Oh, Alexander Hamilton
I have soldiers who will yield for you
If we manage to get this right
They'll surrender by early light
The world will never be the same, Alexander...

History Has Its Eyes On You

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[WASHINGTON]
I was younger than you are now
When I was given my first command
I led my men straight into a massacre
I witnessed their deaths firsthand
I made every mistake
I felt the shame rise in me
And even now I lie awake
[WASHINGTON]
Knowing history has its eyes on me

[HAMILTON/WASHINGTON]
History has its eyes on me. [LAURENS/MULLIGAN]
Whoa...
Whoa...
Whoa...
Yeah

[COMPANY]
Whoa...
Whoa...
Whoa...
Yeah

[WASHINGTON]
Let me tell you what I wish I'd known
When I was young and dreamed of glory:
You have no control:

[WASHINGTON AND COMPANY]
Who lives, who dies, who tells your story

[WASHINGTON]
I know that we can win
I know that greatness lies in you
But remember from here on in
[WASHINGTON/HAMILTON AND MEN]
History has its
Eyes on you.

Yorktown (The World Turned Upside Down)

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[COMPANY]
The battle of Yorktown. 1781

[LAFAYETTE]
Monsieur Hamilton

[HAMILTON]
Monsieur Lafayette

[LAFAYETTE]
In command where you belong

[HAMILTON]
How you say, no sweat
We're finally on the field. We've had quite a run

[LAFAYETTE]
Immigrants:

[HAMILTON/LAFAYETTE]
We get the job done

[HAMILTON]
So what happens if we win?

[LAFAYETTE]
I go back to France
I bring freedom to my people if I'm given the chance

[HAMILTON]
We'll be with you when you do

[LAFAYETTE]
Go lead your men

[HAMILTON]
See you on the other side

[LAFAYETTE]
‘Til we meet again, let's go!

[ENSEMBLE]
I am not throwin' away my shot!
I am not throwin' away my shot!
Hey yo, I'm just like my country, I'm young
Scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwin' away my shot!
I am not throwin' away my shot!

[HAMILTON]
‘Til the world turns upside down...

[ENSEMBLE]
‘Til the world turns upside down!

[HAMILTON]
I imagine death so much it feels more like a memory
This is where it gets me: on my feet
The enemy ahead of me
If this is the end of me, at least I have a friend with me
Weapon in my hand, a command, and my men with me
Then I remember my Eliza's expecting me...
Not only that, my Eliza's expecting
We gotta go, gotta get the job done
Gotta start a new nation, gotta meet my son!
Take the bullets out your gun!

[ENSEMBLE]
What?

[HAMILTON]
The bullets out your gun!

[ENSEMBLE]
What?

[HAMILTON]
We move under cover and we move as one
Through the night, we have one shot to live another day
We cannot let a stray gunshot give us away
We will fight up close, seize the moment and stay in it
It's either that or meet the business end of a bayonet
The code word is ‘Rochambeau,' dig me?

[ENSEMBLE]
Rochambeau!

[HAMILTON]
You have your orders now, go, man, go!
And so the American experiment begins
With my friends all scattered to the winds
Laurens is in South Carolina, redefining brav'ry

[HAMILTON/LAURENS]
We'll never be free until we end slavery!

[HAMILTON]
When we finally drive the British away
Lafayette is there waiting-

[HAMILTON/LAFAYETTE]
In Chesapeake Bay!

[HAMILTON]
How did we know that this plan would work?
We had a spy on the inside. That's right

[HAMILTON/COMPANY]
Hercules Mulligan!

[MULLIGAN]
A tailor spyin' on the British government!
I take their measurements, information and then I smuggle it

[COMPANY]
Up

[MULLIGAN]
To my brother's revolutionary covenant
I'm runnin' with the Sons of Liberty and I am lovin' it!
See, that's what happens when you up against the ruffians
We in the shit now, somebody gotta shovel it!
Hercules Mulligan, I need no introduction
When you knock me down I get the fuck back up again!

[COMPANY]
Left! Right! Hold!
Go!
What! What! What!

[HAMILTON]
After a week of fighting, a young man in a red coat stands on a parapet

[LAFAYETTE]
We lower our guns as he frantically waves a white handkerchief

[MULLIGAN]
And just like that, it's over. We tend to our wounded, we count our dead

[LAURENS]
Black and white soldiers wonder alike if this really means freedom

[WASHINGTON]
Not. Yet

[HAMILTON]
We negotiate the terms of surrender
I see George Washington smile
We escort their men out of Yorktown
They stagger home single file
Tens of thousands of people flood the streets
There are screams and church bells ringing
And as our fallen foes retreat
I hear the drinking song they're singing...

[ALL MEN]
The world turned upside down

[FULL COMPANY]
The world turned upside down
The world turned upside down
The world turned upside down
Down
Down, down, down

[LAFAYETTE]
Freedom for America, freedom for France!

[COMPANY]
Down, down, down

[HAMILTON]
Gotta start a new nation
Gotta meet my son

[COMPANY]
Down, down, down

[MULLIGAN]
We won!

[LAFAYETTE]
We won!

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE/LAURENS]
We won!

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE/LAURENS/HAMILTON/WASHINGTON]
We won!

[COMPANY]
The world turned upside down!

What Comes Next

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[KING GEORGE]
They say
The price of my war's not a price that they're willing to pay
Insane
You cheat with the French, now I'm fighting with France and with Spain
I'm so blue
I thought that we'd made an arrangement
When you went away
You were mine to subdue
Well, even despite our estrangement, I've got
A small query for you:

What comes next?
You've been freed
Do you know how hard it is to lead?

You're on your own
Awesome. Wow
Do you have a clue what happens now?

Oceans rise
Empires fall
It's much harder when it's all your call

All alone, across the sea
When your people say they hate you, don't
Come crawling back to me

Da da da dat da dat da da da
Da ya da
Da da dat
Da da ya da...

You're on your own...

Dear Theodosia

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[BURR]
Dear Theodosia, what to say to you?
You have my eyes. You have your mother's name

When you came into the world, you cried and it broke my heart

I'm dedicating every day to you
Domestic life was never quite my style
When you smile, you knock me out, I fall apart
And I thought I was so smart

You will come of age with our young nation
We'll bleed and fight for you, we'll make it right for you
If we lay a strong enough foundation
We'll pass it on to you, we'll give the world to you
And you'll blow us all away...
Someday, someday
Yeah, you'll blow us all away
Someday, someday

[HAMILTON]
Oh Philip, when you smile I am undone
My son
Look at my son. Pride is not the word I'm looking for

There is so much more inside me now
Oh Philip, you outshine the morning sun
My son
When you smile, I fall apart
And I thought I was so smart
My father wasn't around

[BURR]
My father wasn't around
[HAMILTON]
I swear that
I'll be around for you.
[BURR]
I'll be around for you.

[HAMILTON]
I'll do whatever it takes

[BURR]
I'll make a million mistakes

[BURR/HAMILTON]
I'll make the world safe and sound for you...
...will come of age with our young nation
We'll bleed and fight for you, we'll make it right for you

If we lay a strong enough foundation
We'll pass it on to you, we'll give the world to you
And you'll blow us all away...
Someday, someday
Yeah, you'll blow us all away

Non-Stop

After the war I went back to New York

[HAMILTON]
A-After the war I went back to New York

[BURR]
I finished up my studies and I practiced law

[HAMILTON]
I practiced law, Burr worked next door
[BURR]
Even though we started at the very same time
Alexander Hamilton began to climb
How to account for his rise to the top?
Maaaaan, the man is
Non-stop!

[ENSEMBLE]
Non-stop!

[HAMILTON]
Gentlemen of the jury, I'm curious, bear with me
Are you aware that we're making hist'ry?
This is the first murder trial of our brand-new nation
[HAMILTON]
The liberty behind
Deliberation-

[ENSEMBLE]
Non-stop!

[HAMILTON]
I intend to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt
With my assistant counsel-

[BURR]
Co-counsel
Hamilton, sit down
Our client Levi Weeks is innocent. Call your first witness
That's all you had to say!

[HAMILTON]
Okay!
One more thing-

[BURR]
Why do you assume you're the smartest in the room?
Why do you assume you're the smartest in the room?
Why do you assume you're the smartest in the room?
Soon that attitude may be your doom!

[ENSEMBLE]
Awwww!

[BURR]
Why do you write like you're running out of time?
Write day and night like you're running out of time?
Ev'ry day you fight, like you're running out of time

Keep on fighting. In the meantime- [ENSEMBLE]
Why do you write like you're running out of time?

Ev'ry day you fight, like you're running out of time

Non-stop!

[HAMILTON]
Corruption's such an old song that we can sing along in harmony
And nowhere is it stronger than in Albany
This colony's economy's increasingly stalling and

[HAMILTON]
Honestly, that's why public service
Seems to be calling me.

[BURR AND ENSEMBLE]
He's just
Non-stop!

[HAMILTON]
I practiced the law, I practic'ly perfected it
I've seen injustice in the world and I've corrected it
Now for a strong central democracy
If not, then I'll be Socrates

Throwing verbal rocks
At these mediocrities.

[ENSEMBLE]
Awww!

[BURR]
Hamilton, at the Constitutional Convention:

[HAMILTON]
I was chosen for the Constitutional Convention

[BURR]
There as a New York junior delegate:
[HAMILTON]
Now what I'm going to say may sound indelicate...

[BURR]
Goes and proposes his own form of government!

His own plan for a new form of government!

[COMPANY]
Awwww!

What?

What?

Talks for six hours! The convention is listless!

[ENSEMBLE MAN]
Bright young man...

Can we confer, sir?

Is this a legal matter?

HAMILTON
Yes, and it's important to me

[BURR]
What do you need?

[HAMILTON]
Burr, you're a better lawyer than me

[BURR]
Okay

[HAMILTON]
I know I talk too much, I'm abrasive
You're incredible in court. You're succinct, persuasive
My client needs a strong defense. You're the solution

[BURR]
Who's your client?

[HAMILTON]
The new U.S. Constitution?

[BURR]
No

[HAMILTON]
Hear me out

[BURR]
No way!

A series of essays, anonymously published
Defending the document to the public

[BURR]
No one will read it

[HAMILTON]
I disagree

[BURR]
And if it fails?

[HAMILTON]
Burr, that's why we need it

[BURR]
The constitution's a mess

[HAMILTON]
So it needs amendments

[BURR]
It's full of contradictions

[HAMILTON]
So is independence
We have to start somewhere

[BURR]
No. No way

[HAMILTON]
You're making a mistake

[BURR]
Good night

[HAMILTON]
Hey
What are you waiting for?
What do you stall for?

[BURR]
What?

[HAMILTON]
We won the war
What was it all for?
Do you support this constitution?

[BURR]
Of course

[HAMILTON]
Then defend it

[BURR]
And what if you're backing the wrong horse?

[HAMILTON]
Burr, we studied and we fought and we killed
For the notion of a nation we now get to build
For once in your life, take a stand with pride
I don't understand how you stand to the side

[BURR]
I'll keep all my plans
Close to my chest

I'll wait here and see
Which way the wind
Will blow
I'm taking my time
Watching the
Afterbirth of a nation
Watching the tension grow.

[ENSEMBLE]
Wait for it, wait for
It, wait...

Which way the wind
Will blow
I'm taking my time
Watching the
Afterbirth of a nation
Watching the tension grow.

If I could grant you peace of mind
Would that be enough?

[BURR]
Alexander joins forces with James Madison and John Jay to write a series of essays defending the new United States Constitution, entitled The Federalist Papers. The plan was to write a total of twenty-five essays, the work divided evenly among the three men. In the end, they wrote eighty-five essays, in the span of six months. John Jay got sick after writing five. James Madison wrote twenty-nine. Hamilton wrote the other fifty-one!

[BURR]
How do you write like you're
Running out of time?
Write day and night like you're

How does a bastard, orphan, son of a whore and a
Scotsman, dropped in the middle of a
Forgotten spot in the Caribbean by providence
Impoverished, in squalor
Grow up to be a hero and a scholar?

[LAURENS]
The ten-dollar founding father without a father
Got a lot farther by working a lot harder
By being a lot smarter
By being a self-starter
By fourteen, they placed him in charge of a
Trading charter

[JEFFERSON]
And every day while slaves were being slaughtered and carted
Away across the waves, he struggled and kept his guard up
Inside, he was longing for something to be a part of
The brother was ready to beg, steal, borrow, or barter

[MADISON]
Then a hurricane came, and devastation reigned
Our man saw his future drip, dripping down the drain
Put a pencil to his temple, connected it to his brain
And he wrote his first refrain, a testament to his pain

[BURR]
Well, the word got around, they said, "This kid is insane, man"
Took up a collection just to send him to the mainland
"Get your education, don't forget from whence you came, and
The world is gonna know your name. What's your name, man?"

[HAMILTON]
Alexander Hamilton
My name is Alexander Hamilton
And there's a million things I haven't done
But just you wait, just you wait...

[ELIZA]
When he was ten his father split, full of it, debt-ridden
Two years later, see Alex and his mother bed-ridden
Half-dead sittin in their own sick, the scent thick

[COMPANY]
And Alex got better but his mother went quick

[WASHINGTON]
Moved in with a cousin, the cousin committed suicide
Left him with nothin' but ruined pride, something new inside
A voice saying
[WASHINGTON]
"You gotta fend for yourself." [COMPANY]
"Alex, you gotta fend for yourself."

[WASHINGTON]
He started retreatin' and readin' every treatise on the shelf
[BURR]
There would have been nothin' left to do
For someone less astute
He woulda been dead or destitute
Without a cent of restitution
Started workin', clerkin' for his late mother's landlord
Tradin' sugar cane and rum and all the things he can't afford
Scammin' for every book he can get his hands on
Plannin' for the future see him now as he stands on
The bow of a ship headed for a new land
In New York you can be a new man

[COMPANY]
There's a million things I haven't done
But just you wait!

[BURR]
What's your name, man?

[COMPANY]
Alexander Hamilton!

Aaron Burr, Sir

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[COMPANY]
1776. New York City

[HAMILTON]
Pardon me. Are you Aaron Burr, sir?

[BURR]
That depends. Who's asking?

[HAMILTON]
Oh, well, sure, sir
I'm Alexander Hamilton, I'm at your service, sir
I have been looking for you

[BURR]
I'm getting nervous

[HAMILTON]
Sir...
I heard your name at Princeton. I was seeking an accelerated course of study when I got sort of out of sorts with a buddy of yours. I may have punched him. It's a blur, sir. He handles the financials?

[BURR]
You punched the bursar

[HAMILTON]
Yes!
I wanted to do what you did. Graduate in two, then join the revolution. He looked at me like I was stupid, I'm not stupid

So how'd you do it? How'd you graduate so fast?

[BURR]
It was my parents' dying wish before they passed

[HAMILTON]
You're an orphan. Of course! I'm an orphan
God, I wish there was a war!
Then we could prove that we're worth more
Than anyone bargained for...

[BURR]
Can I buy you a drink?

[HAMILTON]
That would be nice

[BURR]
While we're talking, let me offer you some free advice
Talk less

[HAMILTON]
What?

[BURR]
Smile more

[HAMILTON]
Ha

[BURR]
Don't let them know what you're against or what you're for

[HAMILTON]
You can't be serious

[BURR]
You wanna get ahead?

[HAMILTON]
Yes

[BURR]
Fools who run their mouths off wind up dead

[LAURENS]
Yo yo yo yo yo!
What time is it?

[LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
Show time!

[BURR]
...like I said...

[LAURENS]
Show time! Show time! Yo!
I'm John Laurens in the place to be!
Two pints o' Sam Adams, but I'm workin' on three, uh!
Those redcoats don't want it with me!
Cuz I will pop chick-a pop these cops till I'm free!

[LAFAYETTE]
Oui oui, mon ami, je m'appelle Lafayette!
The Lancelot of the revolutionary set!
I came from afar just to say "Bonsoir!"
Tell the King "Casse toi!" Who's the best?
C'est moi!

[MULLIGAN]
Brrrah brraaah! I am Hercules Mulligan
Up in it, lovin' it, yes I heard ya mother said "Come again?"
Lock up ya daughters and horses, of course
It's hard to have intercourse over four sets of corsets...

[LAURENS]
No more sex, pour me another brew, son!
Let's raise a couple more...

[LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
To the revolution!

[LAURENS]
Well, if it ain't the prodigy of Princeton college!

[MULLIGAN]
Aaron Burr!

[LAURENS]
Give us a verse, drop some knowledge!

[BURR]
Good luck with that: you're takin' a stand
You spit. I'm ‘a sit. We'll see where we land

[LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
Boooo!

[LAURENS]
Burr, the revolution's imminent. What do you stall for?

[HAMILTON]
If you stand for nothing, Burr, what'll you fall for?
[LAURENS]
Ooh
Who are you? [MULLIGAN]
Ooh

Who are you? [LAFAYETTE]
Ooh

Who are you?

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE/LAURENS]
Ooh, who is this kid? What's he gonna do?

My Shot

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[HAMILTON]
I am not throwing away my shot!
I am not throwing away my shot!
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot!
I'm ‘a get a scholarship to King's College
I prob'ly shouldn't brag, but dag, I amaze and astonish
The problem is I got a lot of brains but no polish
I gotta holler just to be heard
With every word, I drop knowledge!
I'm a diamond in the rough, a shiny piece of coal
Tryin' to reach my goal. My power of speech: unimpeachable
Only nineteen but my mind is older
These New York City streets get colder, I shoulder
Ev'ry burden, ev'ry disadvantage
I have learned to manage, I don't have a gun to brandish
I walk these streets famished
The plan is to fan this spark into a flame
But damn, it's getting dark, so let me spell out the name
I am the-

[HAMILTON/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN/LAURENS]
A-L-E-X-A-N-D
E-R-we are-meant to be...

[HAMILTON]
A colony that runs independently
Meanwhile, Britain keeps shittin' on us endlessly
Essentially, they tax us relentlessly
Then King George turns around, runs a spending spree
He ain't ever gonna set his descendants free
So there will be a revolution in this century
Enter me!

[LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN/LAURENS]
(He says in parentheses)

[HAMILTON]
Don't be shocked when your hist'ry book mentions me
I will lay down my life if it sets us free
Eventually, you'll see my ascendancy
[HAMILTON]
And I am not throwing away
My shot
I am not throwing away
My shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot
[LAURENS]
My shot!

My shot!

And I'm not throwing away my shot.

[HAMILTON/MULLIGAN/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE]
I am not throwing away my shot
I am not throwing away my shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot
It's time to take a shot!

[LAFAYETTE]
I dream of life without a monarchy
The unrest in France will lead to ‘onarchy?
‘Onarchy? How you say, how you say, ‘anarchy?'
When I fight, I make the other side panicky
With my-

[HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
Shot!

[MULLIGAN]
Yo, I'm a tailor's apprentice
And I got y'all knuckleheads in loco parentis
I'm joining the rebellion cuz I know it's my chance
To socially advance, instead of sewin' some pants!
I'm gonna take a-

[HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
Shot!

[LAURENS]
But we'll never be truly free
Until those in bondage have the same rights as you and me
You and I. Do or die. Wait till I sally in
On a stallion with the first black battalion
Have another-

[HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
Shot!

[BURR]
Geniuses, lower your voices
You keep out of trouble and you double your choices
I'm with you, but the situation is fraught
You've got to be carefully taught:
If you talk, you're gonna get shot!

[HAMILTON]
Burr, check what we got
Mister Lafayette, hard rock like Lancelot
I think your pants look hot
Laurens, I like you a lot
Let's hatch a plot blacker than the kettle callin' the pot...
What are the odds the gods would put us all in one spot
Poppin' a squat on conventional wisdom, like it or not
A bunch of revolutionary manumission abolitionists?
Give me a position, show me where the ammunition is!

Oh, am I talkin' too loud?
Sometimes I get over excited, shoot off at the mouth
I never had a group of friends before
I promise that I'll make y'all proud

[LAURENS]
Let's get this guy in front of a crowd

[HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN/ENSEMBLE]
I am not throwing away my shot
I am not throwing away my shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot

I am not throwing away my shot
I am not throwing away my shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot
[LAURENS]
Ev'rybody sing:
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Hey!
Whoa!
Wooh!!
Whoa!
Ay, let ‘em hear ya!

Let's go!

I said shout it to the rooftops!
Said, to the rooftops!
Come on!

Come on, let's go! [HAMILTON/LAFAYETTE/
MULLIGAN]
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

Whoa!

Whoa!

Yea!

[COMPANY]
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Whoa!

Yea!

[LAURENS]
Rise up!
When you're living on your knees, you rise up
Tell your brother that he's gotta rise up
Tell your sister that she's gotta rise up
[LAURENS AND ENSEMBLE]
When are these colonies gonna rise up?
When are these colonies gonna rise up?
When are these colonies gonna rise up?
When are these colonies gonna rise up?

Rise up!
[COMPANY]
Whoa! Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!

Rise up!

[HAMILTON]
I imagine death so much it feels more like a memory
When's it gonna get me?
In my sleep? Seven feet ahead of me?
If I see it comin', do I run or do I let it be?
Is it like a beat without a melody?
See, I never thought I'd live past twenty
Where I come from some get half as many
Ask anybody why we livin' fast and we laugh, reach for a flask
We have to make this moment last, that's plenty

Scratch that
This is not a moment, it's the movement
Where all the hungriest brothers with
Something to prove went?
Foes oppose us, we take an honest stand
We roll like Moses, claimin' our promised land
And? If we win our independence?
‘Zat a guarantee of freedom for our descendants?
Or will the blood we shed begin an endless
Cycle of vengeance and death with no defendants?
I know the action in the street is excitin'
But Jesus, between all the bleedin' ‘n fightin'
I've been readin' ‘n writin'
We need to handle our financial situation
Are we a nation of states? What's the state of our nation?
I'm past patiently waitin'. I'm passionately
Smashin' every expectation
Every action's an act of creation!
I'm laughin' in the face of casualties and sorrow
For the first time, I'm thinkin' past tomorrow

[HAMILTON AND COMPANY]
And I am not throwing away my shot
I am not throwing away my shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot

There's nothing rich folks love more
Than going downtown and slummin' it with the poor
They pull up in their carriages and gawk
At the students in the common

Uh-oh, but little does he know that
His daughters, Peggy, Angelica, Eliza
Sneak into the city just to watch all the guys at-

You searchin for an urchin who can give you ideals?

Farmer Refuted

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[SEABURY]
Hear ye, hear ye! My name is Samuel Seabury
And I present "Free Thoughts on the
Proceedings of the Continental Congress!"
Heed not the rabble who scream revolution
They have not your interests at heart

[MULLIGAN]
Oh my God. Tear this dude apart

[SEABURY]
Chaos and bloodshed are not a solution
Don't let them lead you astray
This Congress does not speak for me

[BURR]
Let him be

[SEABURY]
They're playing a dangerous game
I pray the king shows you his mercy
For shame, for shame...
[HAMILTON]
Yo!
He'd have you all unravel at the
Sound of screams but the
Revolution is comin'
The have-nots are gonna
Win this
It's hard to listen to you with a straight face

Chaos and bloodshed already haunt us, honestly you shouldn't even talk. And what about Boston? Look at the cost, n' all that we've lost n' you talk
About Congress?!

My dog speaks more eloquently than thee!

But strangely, your mange is the same

Is he in Jersey?

For the revolution!
[SEABURY]
Heed not the rabble
Who scream
Revolution, they
Have not your
Interests
At heart

Chaos and bloodshed are
Not a
Solution. Don't
Let them lead you
Astray
This Congress does not
Speak for me

They're playing a dangerous game

I pray the king shows you his mercy

For shame

For shame,

[COMPANY]
For the revolution!

[SEABURY]
Heed-

[HAMILTON]
If you repeat yourself again I'm gonna-

[SEABURY/HAMILTON]
Scream-

[HAMILTON]
Honestly, look at me, please don't read!

[SEABURY]
Not your interests-

[HAMILTON]
Don't modulate the key then not debate with me!
Why should a tiny island across the sea regulate the price of tea?

[BURR]
Alexander, please!

[HAMILTON]
Burr, I'd rather be divisive than indecisive, drop the niceties

[ENSEMBLE]
Silence! A message from the King!

You'll Be Back

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[KING GEORGE]
You say
The price of my love's not a price that you're willing to pay
You cry
In your tea which you hurl in the sea when you see me go by
Why so sad?
Remember we made an arrangement when you went away
Now you're making me mad
Remember, despite our estrangement, I'm your man
You'll be back
Soon you'll see
You'll remember you belong to me
You'll be back
Time will tell
You'll remember that I served you well
Oceans rise
Empires fall
We have seen each other through it all
And when push
Comes to shove
I will send a fully armed battalion
To remind you of my love!

Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da
Da da dat dat da ya da!
Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da
Da da dat dat da...

You say our love is draining and you can't go on
You'll be the one complaining when I am gone...
And no, don't change the subject
Cuz you're my favorite subject
My sweet, submissive subject
My loyal, royal subject
Forever and ever and ever and ever and ever...

You'll be back
Like before
I will fight the fight and win the war
For your love
For your praise
And I'll love you till my dying days
When you're gone
I'll go mad
So don't throw away this thing we had

Cuz when push comes to shove
I will kill your friends and family to remind you of my love
Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da
Da da dat dat da ya da!
Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da
Da da dat-
Everybody!

[ENSEMBLE]
Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da
Da da dat dat da ya da!
Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da da da da

We gotta make an all out stand
Ayo, I'm gonna need a right-hand man.
ENSEMBLE
What?

What?

Buck, buck, buck, buck, buck!

Buck, buck, buck, buck, buck!

[WASHINGTON]
Check it-
Can I be real a second?
For just a millisecond?
Let down my guard and tell the people how I feel a second?
Now I'm the model of a modern major general
The venerated Virginian veteran whose men are all
Lining up, to put me up on a pedestal
Writin' letters to relatives
Embellishin' my elegance and eloquence
But the elephant is in the room
The truth is in ya face when ya hear the British cannons go...

[ENSEMBLE]
Boom!

[WASHINGTON]
Any hope of success is fleeting
How can I keep leading when the people I'm
Leading keep retreating?
We put a stop to the bleeding as the British take Brooklyn
Knight takes rook, but look
[WASHINGTON]
We are outgunned

Outmanned

Outnumbered
Outplanned

We gotta make an all out stand
Ayo, I'm gonna need a right-hand man

Incoming!

Let's take a stand with the stamina God has granted us
Hamilton won't abandon ship
Yo, let's steal their cannons-
[MULLIGAN]
Shh-boom! [COMPANY]

[WASHINGTON]
Goes the cannon, watch the blood and the shit spray and...

[COMPANY]
Boom!

Goes the cannon, we're abandonin' Kips Bay and...

[COMPANY]
Boom!

[WASHINGTON]
There's another ship and...

[COMPANY]
Boom!

[WASHINGTON]
We just lost the southern tip and...

[COMPANY]
Boom!

[WASHINGTON]
We gotta run to Harlem quick, we can't afford another slip
Guns and horses giddyup
I decide to divvy up
My forces, they're skittish as the British cut the city up
This close to giving up, facing mad scrutiny
I scream in the face of this mass mutiny:
Are these the men with which I am to defend America?
We ride at midnight, Manhattan in the distance
I cannot be everywhere at once, people
I'm in dire need of assistance...

[BURR]
Your excellency, sir!

[WASHINGTON]
Who are you?

[BURR]
Aaron Burr, Sir?
Permission to state my case?

[WASHINGTON]
As you were

[BURR]
Sir
I was a captain under General Montgomery
Until he caught a bullet in the neck in Quebec
And well, in summary
I think that I could be of some assistance
I admire how you keep firing on the British
From a distance

[WASHINGTON]
Huh

[BURR]
I have some questions, a couple of suggestions on how to fight instead of fleeing west

[WASHINGTON]
Yes?

[BURR]
Well-

[HAMILTON]
Your excellency, you wanted to see me?

[WASHINGTON]
Hamilton, come in, have you met Burr?

[HAMILTON]
Yes, sir

[HAMILTON AND BURR]
We keep meeting

[BURR]
As I was saying, sir, I look forward to seeing your strategy play out

[WASHINGTON]
Burr?

[BURR]
Sir?

[WASHINGTON]
Close the door on your way out

[HAMILTON]
Have I done something wrong, sir?

[WASHINGTON]
On the contrary
I called you here because our odds are beyond scary
Your reputation precedes you, but I have to laugh

[HAMILTON]
Sir?

[WASHINGTON]
Hamilton, how come no one can get you on their staff?

[HAMILTON]
Sir!

[WASHINGTON]
Don't get me wrong, you're a young man, of great renown
I know you stole British cannons when we were still downtown
Nathaniel Green and Henry Knox wanted to hire you...

[HAMILTON]
To be their Secretary? I don't think so

[WASHINGTON]
Why're you upset?

[HAMILTON]
I'm not-

[WASHINGTON]
It's alright, you want to fight, you've got a hunger
I was just like you when I was younger
Head full of fantasies of dyin' like a martyr?

[HAMILTON]
Yes

[WASHINGTON]
Dying is easy, young man. Living is harder

[HAMILTON]
Why are you telling me this?

[WASHINGTON]
I'm being honest
I'm working with a third of what our Congress has promised
We are a powder keg about to explode
I need someone like you to lighten the load. So?

[COMPANY (EXCEPT HAMILTON)]
I am not throwin' away my shot!
I am not throwin' away my shot!
Ayo, I'm just like my country, I'm young
Scrappy and hungry!

[HAMILTON]
I am not throwing away my shot!

[WASHINGTON]
Son

[WASHINGON AND COMPANY]
We are outgunned, outmanned!

[HAMILTON]
You need all the help you can get
I have some friends. Laurens, Mulligan
Marquis de Lafayette, okay, what else?

[WASHINGTON AND COMPANY]
Outnumbered, outplanned!

[HAMILTON]
We'll need some spies on the inside
Some King's men who might let some things slide
[HAMILTON]
I'll write to Congress and tell ‘em we need supplies, you rally the guys, master the element of surprise

I'll rise above my station, organize your information, ‘til we rise to the occasion of our new nation. Sir!

[ENSEMBLE]
Here comes the General!

[HAMILTON]
Rise up!

[HAMILTON]
Rise up!

[ENSEMBLE]
Here comes the General!

A Winter's Ball

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[BURR]
How does the bastard, orphan, son of a whore
Go on and on
Grow into more of a phenomenon?
Watch this obnoxious, arrogant, loudmouth bother
Be seated at the right hand of the father
Washington hires Hamilton right on sight
But Hamilton still wants to fight, not write
Now Hamilton's skill with a quill is undeniable
But what do we have in common? We're
Reliable with the

[ALL MEN]
Ladies!

[BURR]
There are so many to deflower!

[ALL MEN]
Ladies!

[BURR]
Looks! Proximity to power

[ALL MEN]
Ladies!

[BURR]
They delighted and distracted him
Martha Washington named her feral tomcat after him!

[HAMILTON]
That's true

[FULL COMPANY]
1780

[BURR]
A winter's ball
And the Schuyler sisters are the envy of all
Yo, if you can marry a sister, you're rich, son

[HAMILTON]
Is it a question of if, Burr, or which one?

Helpless

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[HAMILTON/BURR/LAURENS/ALL WOMEN (EXCEPT ELIZA)]
Hey hey hey hey
[ELIZA]
Ohh, I do I do I do I
Dooo! Hey!
Ohh, I do I do I do I
Dooo! Boy you got me [ALL WOMEN]
Hey hey hey hey
Hey hey hey hey
Hey hey hey hey
Hey hey hey

[ELIZA AND WOMEN]
Helpless!
Look into your eyes, and the sky's the limit I'm helpless!
Down for the count, and I'm drownin' in ‘em

[ELIZA]
I have never been the type to try and grab the spotlight
We were at a revel with some rebels on a hot night
Laughin' at my sister as she's dazzling the room
Then you walked in and my heart went "Boom!"
Tryin' to catch your eye from the side of the ballroom
Everybody's dancin' and the band's top volume

[ELIZA AND WOMEN]
Grind to the rhythm as we wine and dine
[ELIZA]
Grab my sister, and
Whisper, "Yo, this
One's mine."

My sister made her way across the room to you
And I got nervous, thinking "What's she gonna do?"
She grabbed you by the arm, I'm thinkin' "I'm through"
Then you look back at me and suddenly I'm
Helpless!

Oh, look at those eyes

Oh!
Yeah, I'm
Helpless, I know

I'm so into you
I am so into you

I know I'm down for the count
And I'm drownin' in ‘em.

[ALL WOMEN]
Oooh

Oooh

Oooh

Oooh

Helpless!

Look into your eyes
And the sky's the limit
I'm
Helpless!
Down for the count
And I'm drownin' in ‘em

I'm helpless!

Look into your eyes
And the sky's the limit I'm helpless!

Down for the count
And I'm drownin' in ‘em.

[HAMILTON]
Where are you taking me?

[ANGELICA]
I'm about to change your life

[HAMILTON]
Then by all means, lead the way

[ELIZA]
Elizabeth Schuyler. It's a pleasure to meet you

[HAMILTON]
Schuyler?

[ANGELICA]
My sister

[ELIZA]
Thank you for all your service

[HAMILTON]
If it takes fighting a war for us to meet, it will have been worth it

[ANGELICA]
I'll leave you to it

[ELIZA AND WOMEN]
One week later

[ELIZA]
I'm writin' a letter nightly
Now my life gets better, every letter that you write me
Laughin' at my sister, cuz she wants to form a harem

[ANGELICA]
I'm just sayin', if you really loved me, you would share him
[ELIZA]
Ha!
Two weeks later
In the living room stressin'
My father's stone-faced
While you're asking for his blessin'
I'm dying inside, as
You wine
And dine
And I'm tryin' not to cry
‘cause there's nothing that your mind can't do
My father makes his way across the room
To you
I panic for a second, thinking
"we're through"
But then he shakes your hand and says
"Be true"
And you turn back to me, smiling, and I'm
Helpless!

Helpless!
Hoo!

That boy is mine
That boy is mine!

Helpless! Helpless!
Down for the count
And I'm drownin' in em

[ALL WOMEN]
Stressin'

Blessin'

Oooh

Oooh

Oooh

Oooh

Helpless!
Look into your eyes
And the sky's the

Helpless!
Down for the count
And I'm drownin' in
‘em I'm
Helpless!

Look into your eyes
And the sky's the
Limit I'm
Helpless!
Down for the count
And I'm drownin' in em

[HAMILTON]
Eliza, I don't have a dollar to my name
An acre of land, a troop to command, a dollop of fame
All I have's my honor, a tolerance for pain
A couple of college credits and my top-notch brain
Insane, your family brings out a different side of me
Peggy confides in me, Angelica tried to take a bite of me
No stress, my love for you is never in doubt
We'll get a little place in Harlem and we'll figure it out
I've been livin' without a family since I was a child
My father left, my mother died, I grew up buckwild
But I'll never forget my mother's face, that was real
And long as I'm alive, Eliza, swear to God
You'll never feel so...

[HAMILTON]
Eliza...

I've never felt so-

My life is gon' be fine cuz Eliza's in it.
[ELIZA]
I do I do I do I do!

I do I do I do I do!

Hey, yeah, yeah!

I'm down for the count
I'm-

I look into your eyes, and the sky's the limit
I'm

...drownin' in ‘em. [ALL WOMEN]
Helpless!

Helpless!

Helpless!

Down for the count
And I'm drownin' in ‘em

Helpless!

Helpless!

Helpless!

Down for the count
And I'm drownin' in ‘em.

Satisfied

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[LAURENS]
Alright, alright. That's what I'm talkin' about!
Now everyone give it up for the maid of honor
Angelica Schuyler!
[ANGELICA]
A toast to the groom!

To the bride!

From your sister

Who is always by your side

To your union

And the hope that you provide

May you always...

Be satisfied.

[ALL MEN]
To the groom!
To the groom!
To the groom!

To the bride!
To the bride!

Angelica!
Angelica!
Angelica!

By your side!

To the union!
To the revolution!

You provide!
You provide!

[HAMILTON AND MEN]
Always-

Rewind-

[ALL WOMEN]
To the groom!

To the bride!

To the bride!

[ELIZA AND WOMEN]
Angelica!

By your side!

To the union!
To the revolution!

You provide!

Always-

Rewind-

[ANGELICA]
I remember that night, I just might
Regret that night for the rest of my days

I remember those soldier boys
Tripping over themselves to win our praise

I remember that dreamlike candlelight
Like a dream that you can't quite place

But Alexander, I'll never forget the first
Time I saw your face

I have never been the same
Intelligent eyes in a hunger-pang frame
And when you said "Hi," I forgot my dang name
Set my heart aflame, ev'ry part aflame

[FULL COMPANY]
This is not a game...

[HAMILTON]
You strike me as a woman who has never been satisfied

[ANGELICA]
I'm sure I don't know what you mean. You forget yourself

[HAMILTON]
You're like me. I'm never satisfied

[ANGELICA]
Is that right?

[HAMILTON]
I have never been satisfied

[ANGELICA]
My name is Angelica Schuyler

[HAMILTON]
Alexander Hamilton

[ANGELICA]
Where's your fam'ly from?

[HAMILTON]
Unimportant. There's a million things I haven't done but
Just you wait, just you wait...

[ANGELICA]
So so so-
So this is what it feels like to match wits
With someone at your level! What the hell is the catch? It's
The feeling of freedom, of seein' the light
It's Ben Franklin with a key and a kite! You see it, right?
The conversation lasted two minutes, maybe three minutes
Ev'rything we said in total agreement, it's
A dream and it's a bit of a dance
A bit of a posture, it's a bit of a stance. He's a
Bit of a flirt, but I'm ‘a give it a chance
I asked about his fam'ly, did you see his answer?
His hands started fidgeting, he looked askance?
He's penniless, he's flying by the seat of his pants

Handsome, boy, does he know it!
Peach fuzz, and he can't even grow it!
I wanna take him far away from this place
Then I turn and see my sister's face and she is...

[ELIZA]
Helpless...

[ANGELICA]
And I know she is...

[ELIZA]
Helpless...

[ANGELICA]
And her eyes are just...

[ELIZA]
Helpless...

[ANGELICA]
And I realize

[ANGELICA AND COMPANY]
Three fundamental truths at the exact same time...

[HAMILTON]
Where are you taking me?

[ANGELICA]
I'm about to change your life

[HAMILTON]
Then by all means, lead the way

[COMPANY (EXCEPT ANGELICA)]
Number one!

[ANGELICA]
I'm a girl in a world in which
My only job is to marry rich
My father has no sons so I'm the one
Who has to social climb for one
So I'm the oldest and the wittiest and the gossip in
New York City is insidious
Alexander is penniless
Ha! That doesn't mean I want him any less

[ELIZA]
Elizabeth Schuyler. It's a pleasure to meet you

[HAMILTON]
Schuyler?

[ANGELICA]
My sister

[COMPANY]
Number two!

[ANGELICA]
He's after me cuz I'm a Schuyler sister
That elevates his status, I'd
Have to be naïve to set that aside
Maybe that is why I introduce him to Eliza
Now that's his bride
Nice going, Angelica, he was right
You will never be satisfied

[ELIZA]
Thank you for all your service

[HAMILTON]
If it takes fighting a war for us to meet, it will have been worth it

[ANGELICA]
I'll leave you to it

[COMPANY]
Number three!

[ANGELICA]
I know my sister like I know my own mind
You will never find anyone as trusting or as kind
If I tell her that I love him she'd be silently resigned
He'd be mine
She would say, "I'm fine"

[ANGELICA AND COMPANY]
She'd be lying

[ANGELICA]
But when I fantasize at night
It's Alexander's eyes
As I romanticize what might
Have been if I hadn't sized him
Up so quickly
At least my dear Eliza's his wife;
At least I keep his eyes in my life...
[ANGELICA]
To the groom!

To the bride!

From your sister

Who is always by your side

To your union

And the hope that you provide

May you always

Be satisfied

And I know

She'll be happy as

His bride
And I know [ALL MEN (EXCEPT HAMILTON)]
To the groom!
To the groom!
To the groom!

To the bride!
To the bride!

Angelica!
Angelica!

By your side

To the union!
To the revolution!

You provide!
You provide!

[HAMILTON AND MEN]
Always-

Be satisfied

Be satisfied

[MEN]
Be satisfied
Be satisfied
Be satisfied
Be satisfied

Be satisfied
Be satisfied

Be satisfied
Be satisfied
Be satisfied
Be satisfied.

[ALL WOMEN (EXCEPT ELIZA)]
To the groom!

To the bride!

To the bride!

[ELIZA AND WOMEN]
Angelica!

By your side

To the union!

You provide!

Always-

The Story of Tonight (Reprise)

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[LAURENS]
I may not live to see our glory!

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE]
I may not live to see our glory!

[LAURENS]
But I've seen wonders great and small

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE]
I've seen wonders great and small

[LAURENS]
‘Cause if the tomcat can get married

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE]
If Alexander can get married-

[LAURENS]
There's hope for our ass, after all!

[LAFAYETTE]
Raise a glass to freedom

[LAURENS/MULLIGAN]
Hey!
Something you will never see again!

[MULLIGAN]
No matter what she tells you

[LAFAYETTE]
Let's have another round tonight!

[LAURENS]
Raise a glass to the four of us!

[LAFAYETTE/HAMILTON]
Ho!

[MULLIGAN]
To the newly not poor of us!

[LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/HAMILTON]
Woo!

[LAFAYETTE]
We'll tell the story of tonight

[LAURENS]
Let's have another round-

[HAMILTON]
Well, if it isn't Aaron Burr

[BURR]
Sir!

[HAMILTON]
I didn't think that you would make it

[BURR]
To be sure

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE]
Burr!

[BURR]
I came to say congratulations

[MULLIGAN]
Spit a verse, Burr!

[BURR]
I see the whole gang is here

[LAFAYETTE]
You are the worst, Burr!

[HAMILTON]
Ignore them. Congrats to you, Lieutenant Colonel
I wish I had your command instead of manning George's journal

[BURR]
No, you don't

[HAMILTON]
Yes, I do

[BURR]
Now, be sensible
From what I hear, you've made yourself indispensable

[LAURENS]
Well, well, I heard
You've got a special someone on the side, Burr

[HAMILTON]
Is that so?

[LAURENS]
What are you tryin' to hide, Burr?

[BURR]
I should go

[HAMILTON]
No, these guys should go

[LAFAYETTE]
What?

[LAURENS]
No!

[HAMILTON]
Leave us alone

[MULLIGAN]
Man...

[HAMILTON]
It's alright, Burr. I wish you'd brought this girl with you tonight, Burr

[BURR]
You're very kind, but I'm afraid it's unlawful, sir

[HAMILTON]
What do you mean?

[BURR]
She's married

[HAMILTON]
I see

[BURR]
She's married to a British officer

[HAMILTON]
Oh shit...

[BURR]
Congrats again, Alexander. Smile more
I'll see you on the other side of the war

[HAMILTON]
I will never understand you
If you love this woman, go get her! What are you waiting for?

[BURR]
I'll see you on the other side of the war

[HAMILTON]
I'll see you on the other side of the war

Wait For It

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[BURR]
Theodosia writes me a letter everyday
I'm keeping the bed warm while her husband is away
He's on the British side in Georgia
He's trying to keep the colonies in line
But he can keep all of Georgia
Theodosia, she's mine

Love doesn't discriminate
Between the sinners
And the saints
It takes and it takes and it takes
And we keep loving anyway
We laugh and we cry
And we break
And we make our mistakes
And if there's a reason I'm by her side
When so many have tried
Then I'm willing to wait for it
I'm willing to wait for it
[BURR]
My grandfather was a fire and brimstone preacher

But there are things that the
Homilies and hymns won't teach ya

My mother was a genius

My father commanded respect

When they died they left no instructions
Just a legacy to protect

[MEN]
Preacher, preacher
Preacher

Teach ya, teach ya, teach ya

Respect, respect

[WOMEN]
Genius

[BURR/ENSEMBLE]
Death doesn't discriminate
Between the sinners
And the saints
It takes and it takes and it takes
And we keep living anyway
We rise and we fall
And we break
And we make our mistakes
And if there's a reason I'm still alive
When everyone who loves me has died
I'm willing to wait for it
I'm willing to wait for it

Wait for it

He has nothing to lose

[BURR]
Hamilton's pace is relentless
He wastes no time

What is it like in his shoes?

Hamilton doesn't hesitate
He exhibits no restraint
He takes and he takes and he takes
And he keeps winning anyway
He changes the game
He plays and he raises the stakes
And if there's a reason
He seems to thrive when so few survive, then Goddamnit-
[BURR]
I'm willing to wait for it

I'm willing to wait for it...

Life doesn't discriminate
Between the sinners and the saints
It takes and it takes and it takes

We rise

And if there's a reason I'm still alive
When so many have died
Then I'm willin' to-

Stay Alive

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[ELIZA]
Stay alive...

[ELIZA/ANGELICA/ENSEMBLE WOMEN]
Stay alive...

[HAMILTON]
I have never seen the General so despondent
I have taken over writing all his correspondence
Congress writes, "George, attack the British forces."
I shoot back, we have resorted to eating our horses
Local merchants deny us equipment, assistance
They only take British money, so sing a song of sixpence

[WASHINGTON]
The cavalry's not coming

[HAMILTON]
Sir!

[WASHINGTON]
Alex, listen. There's only one way for us to win this
Provoke outrage, outright

[HAMILTON]
That's right

[WASHINGTON]
Don't engage, strike by night
Remain relentless ‘til their troops take flight

[HAMILTON]
Make it impossible to justify the cost of the fight

[WASHINGTON]
Outrun

[HAMILTON]
Outrun

[WASHINGTON]
Outlast

[HAMILTON]
Outlast

[WASHINGTON]
Hit ‘em quick, get out fast

[HAMILTON]
Chick-a-plao!

[WASHINGTON]
Stay alive ‘til this horror show is past
We're gonna fly a lot of flags half-mast

[HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE]
Raise a glass!

[MULLIGAN]
I go back to New York and my apprenticeship

[LAFAYETTE]
I ask for French aid, I pray that France has sent a ship

[LAURENS]
I stay at work with Hamilton
We write essays against slavery
And every day's a test of our camaraderie
And bravery

[HAMILTON]
We cut supply lines, we steal contraband
We pick and choose our battles and places to take a stand
And ev'ry day
"Sir, entrust me with a command,"
And ev'ry day

[WASHINGTON]
No

[HAMILTON]
He dismisses me out of hand
[HAMILTON]
Instead of me
He promotes
Charles Lee
Makes him second-in-command:

[LEE]
Charles Lee. [ELIZA/ANGELICA]
Stay alive...

[LEE]
I'm a General. Whee!!!!

[HAMILTON]
Yeah. He's not the choice I would have gone with

[HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE]
He shits the bed at the Battle of Monmouth

[WASHINGTON]
Ev'ryone attack!

[LEE]
Retreat!

[WASHINGTON]
Attack!

[LEE]
Retreat!

[WASHINGTON]
What are you doing, Lee? Get back on your feet!

[LEE]
But there's so many of them!

[WASHINGTON]
I'm sorry, is this not your speed?!
Hamilton!

[HAMILTON]
Ready, sir!

[WASHINGTON]
Have Lafayette take the lead!

[HAMILTON]
Yes, sir!

[LAURENS]
A thousand soldiers die in a hundred degree heat

[LAFAYETTE]
As we snatch a stalemate from the jaws of defeat

[HAMILTON]
Charles Lee was left behind
Without a pot to piss in
He started sayin' this to anybody who would listen:

[LEE]
Washington cannot be left alone to his devices
Indecisive, from crisis to crisis
The best thing he can do for the revolution
Is turn n' go back to plantin' tobacco in Mount Vernon

[COMPANY]
Oo!!

[WASHINGTON]
Don't do a thing. History will prove him wrong

[HAMILTON]
But, sir!

[WASHINGTON]
We have a war to fight, let's move along

[LAURENS]
Strong words from Lee, someone oughta hold him to it

[HAMILTON]
I can't disobey direct orders

[LAURENS]
Then I'll do it
Alexander, you're the closest friend I've got

[HAMILTON]
Laurens, do not throw away your shot

Ten Duel Commandments

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[MEN]
One, two, three, four

[FULL COMPANY]
Five, six, seven, eight, nine...

[BURR/HAMILTON/LAURENS/LEE]
It's the Ten Duel Commandments

[FULL COMPANY]
It's the Ten Duel Commandments
Number one!

[LAURENS]
The challenge: demand satisfaction
If they apologize, no need for further action

[COMPANY]
Number two!

[LAURENS]
If they don't, grab a friend, that's your second

[HAMILTON]
Your lieutenant when there's reckoning to be reckoned

[COMPANY]
Number three!

[LEE]
Have your seconds meet face to face

[BURR]
Negotiate a peace...

[HAMILTON]
Or negotiate a time and place

[BURR]
This is commonplace, ‘specially ‘tween recruits

[COMPANY]
Most disputes die, and no one shoots
Number four!

[LAURENS]
If they don't reach a peace, that's alright
Time to get some pistols and a doctor on site

[HAMILTON]
You pay him in advance, you treat him with civility

[BURR]
You have him turn around so he can have deniability

[COMPANY]
Five!

[LEE]
Duel before the sun is in the sky

[COMPANY]
Pick a place to die where it's high and dry
Number six!

[HAMILTON]
Leave a note for your next of kin
Tell ‘em where you been. Pray that hell or heaven lets you in

[COMPANY]
Seven!

[LEE]
Confess your sins. Ready for the moment of adrenaline when you finally face your opponent

[COMPANY]
Number eight!

[LAURENS/LEE/HAMILTON/BURR]
Your last chance to negotiate
Send in your seconds, see if they can set the record straight...

[BURR]
Alexander

[HAMILTON]
Aaron Burr, sir

[BURR]
Can we agree that duels are dumb and immature?

[HAMILTON]
Sure
But your man has to answer for his words, Burr

[BURR]
With his life? We both know that's absurd, sir

[HAMILTON]
Hang on, how many men died because Lee was inexperienced and ruinous?

[BURR]
Okay, so we're doin' this

[COMPANY]
Number nine!

[HAMILTON]
Look ‘em in the eye, aim no higher
Summon all the courage you require
Then count

[MEN]
One two three four

[FULL COMPANY]
Five six seven eight nine

Meet Me Inside

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[HAMILTON]
Lee, do you yield?

[BURR]
You shot him in the side!
Yes, he yields!

[LAURENS]
I'm satisfied

[BURR]
Yo, we gotta clear the field!

[HAMILTON]
Go! We won

[COMPANY]
Here comes the General!

[BURR]
This should be fun

[WASHINGTON]
What is the meaning of this? Mr. Burr, get a medic for the General

[BURR]
Yes, sir

Lee, you will never agree with me
But believe me, these young men don't speak for me
Thank you for your service

[BURR]
Let's ride!

[WASHINGTON]
Hamilton!

[HAMILTON]
Sir!

[WASHINGTON]
Meet me inside

[COMPANY]
Meet him inside! Meet him inside!
Meet him inside, meet him, meet him inside!

[WASHINGTON]
Son-

[HAMILTON]
Don't call me son

[WASHINGTON]
This war is hard enough
Without infighting-

[HAMILTON]
Lee called you out. We called his bluff

[WASHINGTON]
You solve nothing, you aggravate our allies to the south

[HAMILTON]
You're absolutely right, John should have shot him in the mouth
That would've shut him up

[WASHINGTON]
Son-

[HAMILTON]
I'm notcha son-

[WASHINGTON]
Watch your tone
I am not a maiden in need of defending, I am grown

[HAMILTON (OVERLAPPING)]
Charles Lee, Thomas Conway
These men take your name and they rake it
Through the mud

[WASHINGTON]
My name's been through a lot, I can take it

[HAMILTON]
Well, I don't have your name. I don't have your titles
I don't have your land
But, if you-

[WASHINGTON]
No-

[HAMILTON]
If you gave me command of a battalion, a group of men to lead, I could fly above my station after the war

[WASHINGTON]
Or you could die and we need you alive

[HAMILTON]
I'm more than willing to die-

[WASHINGTON]
Your wife needs you alive, son, I need you alive-

[HAMILTON]
Call me son one more time-

[WASHINGTON]
Go home, Alexander
That's an order from your commander

[HAMILTON]
Sir-

[WASHINGTON]
Go home

That Would Be Enough

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[ELIZA]
Look around, look around at how lucky we are
To be alive right now
Look around, look around...

[HAMILTON]
How long have you known?

[ELIZA]
A month or so

[HAMILTON]
Eliza, you should have told me

[ELIZA]
I wrote to the General a month ago

[HAMILTON]
No

[ELIZA]
I begged him to send you home

[HAMILTON]
You should have told me

[ELIZA]
I'm not sorry
[ELIZA]
I knew you'd fight
Until the war was won

But you deserve a chance to meet your son
Look around, look around at how lucky we are
To be alive right now.
[HAMILTON]
The war's not
Done.

[HAMILTON]
Will you relish being a poor man's wife
Unable to provide for your life?

[ELIZA]
I relish being your wife
Look around, look around...

Look at where you are
Look at where you started
The fact that you're alive is a miracle
Just stay alive, that would be enough

And if this child
Shares a fraction of your smile
Or a fragment of your mind, look out world!
That would be enough

I don't pretend to know
The challenges you're facing
The worlds you keep erasing and creating in your mind

But I'm not afraid
I know who I married
So long as you come home at the end of the day
That would be enough

We don't need a legacy
We don't need money
If I could grant you peace of mind

If you could let me inside your heart...
Oh, let me be a part of the narrative
In the story they will write someday
Let this moment be the first chapter:
Where you decide to stay
And I could be enough
And we could be enough
That would be enough

Guns and Ships

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[BURR]
How does a ragtag volunteer army in need of a shower
Somehow defeat a global superpower?
How do we emerge victorious from the quagmire?
Leave the battlefield waving Betsy Ross' flag higher?
Yo. Turns out we have a secret weapon!
An immigrant you know and love who's unafraid to step in!
He's constantly confusin', confoundin' the British henchmen
Ev'ryone give it up for America's favorite fighting Frenchman!

[COMPANY]
Lafayette!

[LAFAYETTE]
I'm takin this horse by the reins makin'
Redcoats redder with bloodstains

[COMPANY]
Lafayette!

[LAFAYETTE]
And I'm never gonna stop until I make ‘em
Drop and burn ‘em up and scatter their remains, I'm

[COMPANY]
Lafayette!

[LAFAYETTE]
Watch me engagin' em! Escapin' em!
Enragin' em! I'm-

[COMPANY]
Lafayette!

[LAFAYETTE]
I go to France for more funds

[COMPANY]
Lafayette!

[LAFAYETTE]
I come back with more

[LAFAYETTE AND ENSEMBLE]
Guns
And ships
And so the balance shifts

[WASHINGTON]
We rendezvous with Rochambeau, consolidate their gifts

[LAFAYETTE]
We can end this war at Yorktown, cut them off at sea, but
For this to succeed, there's someone else we need:

[WASHINGTON]
I know

[WASHINGTON AND COMPANY]
Hamilton!

[LAFAYETTE]
Sir, he knows what to do in a trench
Ingenuitive and fluent in French, ami-

[WASHINGTON AND COMPANY]
Hamilton!

[LAFAYETTE]
Sir, you're gonna have to use him eventually
What's he gonna do on the bench? I mean-

[WASHINGTON AND COMPANY]
Hamilton!

[LAFAYETTE]
No one has more resilience
Or matches my practical tactical brilliance-

[WASHINGTON AND COMPANY]
Hamilton!
[LAFAYETTE]
You wanna fight for your land back?

[WASHINGTON]
I need my right hand man back!

[LAFAYETTE]
Ah! Uh, get ya right hand man back
You know you gotta get ya right hand man back

I mean you gotta put some thought into the letter but the sooner the better
To get your right hand man back!

[COMPANY]
Hamilton!

[WOMEN]

Hamilton!

Hamilton, Hamilton!
Ha- ha-!

[MEN]
Get your right hand man back!

Your right hand man back!

Hamilton!
Ha-
Ha-

Hamilton, Hamilton!
Ha- ha-!

[WASHINGTON]
Alexander Hamilton
Troops are waiting in the field for you
If you join us right now, together we can turn the tide
Oh, Alexander Hamilton
I have soldiers who will yield for you
If we manage to get this right
They'll surrender by early light
The world will never be the same, Alexander...

History Has Its Eyes On You

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[WASHINGTON]
I was younger than you are now
When I was given my first command
I led my men straight into a massacre
I witnessed their deaths firsthand
I made every mistake
I felt the shame rise in me
And even now I lie awake
[WASHINGTON]
Knowing history has its eyes on me

[HAMILTON/WASHINGTON]
History has its eyes on me. [LAURENS/MULLIGAN]
Whoa...
Whoa...
Whoa...
Yeah

[COMPANY]
Whoa...
Whoa...
Whoa...
Yeah

[WASHINGTON]
Let me tell you what I wish I'd known
When I was young and dreamed of glory:
You have no control:

[WASHINGTON AND COMPANY]
Who lives, who dies, who tells your story

[WASHINGTON]
I know that we can win
I know that greatness lies in you
But remember from here on in
[WASHINGTON/HAMILTON AND MEN]
History has its
Eyes on you.

[ENSEMBLE]
Whoa...

Yorktown (The World Turned Upside Down)

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[COMPANY]
The battle of Yorktown. 1781

[LAFAYETTE]
Monsieur Hamilton

[HAMILTON]
Monsieur Lafayette

[LAFAYETTE]
In command where you belong

[HAMILTON]
How you say, no sweat
We're finally on the field. We've had quite a run

[LAFAYETTE]
Immigrants:

[HAMILTON/LAFAYETTE]
We get the job done

[HAMILTON]
So what happens if we win?

[LAFAYETTE]
I go back to France
I bring freedom to my people if I'm given the chance

[HAMILTON]
We'll be with you when you do

[LAFAYETTE]
Go lead your men

[HAMILTON]
See you on the other side

[LAFAYETTE]
‘Til we meet again, let's go!

[ENSEMBLE]
I am not throwin' away my shot!
I am not throwin' away my shot!
Hey yo, I'm just like my country, I'm young
Scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwin' away my shot!
I am not throwin' away my shot!

[HAMILTON]
‘Til the world turns upside down...

[ENSEMBLE]
‘Til the world turns upside down!

[HAMILTON]
I imagine death so much it feels more like a memory
This is where it gets me: on my feet
The enemy ahead of me
If this is the end of me, at least I have a friend with me
Weapon in my hand, a command, and my men with me
Then I remember my Eliza's expecting me...
Not only that, my Eliza's expecting
We gotta go, gotta get the job done
Gotta start a new nation, gotta meet my son!
Take the bullets out your gun!

[ENSEMBLE]
What?

[HAMILTON]
The bullets out your gun!

[ENSEMBLE]
What?

[HAMILTON]
We move under cover and we move as one
Through the night, we have one shot to live another day
We cannot let a stray gunshot give us away
We will fight up close, seize the moment and stay in it
It's either that or meet the business end of a bayonet
The code word is ‘Rochambeau,' dig me?

[ENSEMBLE]
Rochambeau!

[HAMILTON]
You have your orders now, go, man, go!
And so the American experiment begins
With my friends all scattered to the winds
Laurens is in South Carolina, redefining brav'ry

[HAMILTON/LAURENS]
We'll never be free until we end slavery!

[HAMILTON]
When we finally drive the British away
Lafayette is there waiting-

[HAMILTON/LAFAYETTE]
In Chesapeake Bay!

[HAMILTON]
How did we know that this plan would work?
We had a spy on the inside. That's right

[HAMILTON/COMPANY]
Hercules Mulligan!

[MULLIGAN]
A tailor spyin' on the British government!
I take their measurements, information and then I smuggle it

[COMPANY]
Up

[MULLIGAN]
To my brother's revolutionary covenant
I'm runnin' with the Sons of Liberty and I am lovin' it!
See, that's what happens when you up against the ruffians
We in the shit now, somebody gotta shovel it!
Hercules Mulligan, I need no introduction
When you knock me down I get the fuck back up again!

[COMPANY]
Left! Right! Hold!
Go!
What! What! What!

[HAMILTON]
After a week of fighting, a young man in a red coat stands on a parapet

[LAFAYETTE]
We lower our guns as he frantically waves a white handkerchief

[MULLIGAN]
And just like that, it's over. We tend to our wounded, we count our dead

[LAURENS]
Black and white soldiers wonder alike if this really means freedom

[WASHINGTON]
Not. Yet

[HAMILTON]
We negotiate the terms of surrender
I see George Washington smile
We escort their men out of Yorktown
They stagger home single file
Tens of thousands of people flood the streets
There are screams and church bells ringing
And as our fallen foes retreat
I hear the drinking song they're singing...

[ALL MEN]
The world turned upside down

[FULL COMPANY]
The world turned upside down
The world turned upside down
The world turned upside down
Down
Down, down, down

[LAFAYETTE]
Freedom for America, freedom for France!

[COMPANY]
Down, down, down

[HAMILTON]
Gotta start a new nation
Gotta meet my son

[COMPANY]
Down, down, down

[MULLIGAN]
We won!

[LAFAYETTE]
We won!

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE/LAURENS]
We won!

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE/LAURENS/HAMILTON/WASHINGTON]
We won!

[COMPANY]
The world turned upside down!

What Comes Next

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[KING GEORGE]
They say
The price of my war's not a price that they're willing to pay
Insane
You cheat with the French, now I'm fighting with France and with Spain
I'm so blue
I thought that we'd made an arrangement
When you went away
You were mine to subdue
Well, even despite our estrangement, I've got
A small query for you:

What comes next?
You've been freed
Do you know how hard it is to lead?

You're on your own
Awesome. Wow
Do you have a clue what happens now?

Oceans rise
Empires fall
It's much harder when it's all your call

All alone, across the sea
When your people say they hate you, don't
Come crawling back to me

Da da da dat da dat da da da
Da ya da
Da da dat
Da da ya da...

You're on your own...

Dear Theodosia

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[BURR]
Dear Theodosia, what to say to you?
You have my eyes. You have your mother's name

When you came into the world, you cried and it broke my heart

I'm dedicating every day to you
Domestic life was never quite my style
When you smile, you knock me out, I fall apart
And I thought I was so smart

You will come of age with our young nation
We'll bleed and fight for you, we'll make it right for you
If we lay a strong enough foundation
We'll pass it on to you, we'll give the world to you
And you'll blow us all away...
Someday, someday
Yeah, you'll blow us all away
Someday, someday

[HAMILTON]
Oh Philip, when you smile I am undone
My son
Look at my son. Pride is not the word I'm looking for

There is so much more inside me now
Oh Philip, you outshine the morning sun
My son
When you smile, I fall apart
And I thought I was so smart
My father wasn't around

[BURR]
My father wasn't around
[HAMILTON]
I swear that
I'll be around for you.
[BURR]
I'll be around for you.

[HAMILTON]
I'll do whatever it takes

[BURR]
I'll make a million mistakes

[BURR/HAMILTON]
I'll make the world safe and sound for you...
...will come of age with our young nation
We'll bleed and fight for you, we'll make it right for you

If we lay a strong enough foundation
We'll pass it on to you, we'll give the world to you
And you'll blow us all away...
Someday, someday
Yeah, you'll blow us all away
Someday, someday

Non-Stop

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[BURR]
After the war I went back to New York

[HAMILTON]
A-After the war I went back to New York

[BURR]
I finished up my studies and I practiced law

[HAMILTON]
I practiced law, Burr worked next door
[BURR]
Even though we started at the very same time
Alexander Hamilton began to climb
How to account for his rise to the top?
Maaaaan, the man is
Non-stop!

[ENSEMBLE]
Non-stop!

[HAMILTON]
Gentlemen of the jury, I'm curious, bear with me
Are you aware that we're making hist'ry?
This is the first murder trial of our brand-new nation
[HAMILTON]
The liberty behind
Deliberation-

[ENSEMBLE]
Non-stop!

[HAMILTON]
I intend to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt
With my assistant counsel-

[BURR]
Co-counsel
Hamilton, sit down
Our client Levi Weeks is innocent. Call your first witness
That's all you had to say!

[HAMILTON]
Okay!
One more thing-

[BURR]
Why do you assume you're the smartest in the room?
Why do you assume you're the smartest in the room?
Why do you assume you're the smartest in the room?
Soon that attitude may be your doom!

[ENSEMBLE]
Awwww!

[BURR]
Why do you write like you're running out of time?
Write day and night like you're running out of time?
Ev'ry day you fight, like you're running out of time

Keep on fighting. In the meantime- [ENSEMBLE]
Why do you write like you're running out of time?

Ev'ry day you fight, like you're running out of time

Non-stop!

[HAMILTON]
Corruption's such an old song that we can sing along in harmony
And nowhere is it stronger than in Albany
This colony's economy's increasingly stalling and

[HAMILTON]
Honestly, that's why public service
Seems to be calling me.

[BURR AND ENSEMBLE]
He's just
Non-stop!

[HAMILTON]
I practiced the law, I practic'ly perfected it
I've seen injustice in the world and I've corrected it
Now for a strong central democracy
If not, then I'll be Socrates
[HAMILTON]
Throwing verbal rocks
At these mediocrities.

[ENSEMBLE]
Awww!

[BURR]
Hamilton, at the Constitutional Convention:

[HAMILTON]
I was chosen for the Constitutional Convention

[BURR]
There as a New York junior delegate:
[HAMILTON]
Now what I'm going to say may sound indelicate...

[BURR]
Goes and proposes his own form of government!

His own plan for a new form of government!

[COMPANY]
Awwww!

What?

What?

[BURR]
Talks for six hours! The convention is listless!

[ENSEMBLE MAN]
Bright young man...

[ANOTHER ENSEMBLE MAN]
Yo, who the f is this?

[BURR]
Why do you always say what you believe?
Why do you always say what you believe?
Ev'ry proclamation guarantees free ammunition for your enemies!

[BURR AND MEN]
Why do you write like it's
Going out of style?
Write day and night like it's
Going out of style?

[COMPANY]
Why do you always say what you believe?
Awww!

[ALL WOMEN]
Going out of style, hey!

Aaron Burr, sir

[BURR]
It's the middle of the night

[HAMILTON]
Can we confer, sir?

[BURR]
Is this a legal matter?

HAMILTON
Yes, and it's important to me

[BURR]
What do you need?

[HAMILTON]
Burr, you're a better lawyer than me

[BURR]
Okay

[HAMILTON]
I know I talk too much, I'm abrasive
You're incredible in court. You're succinct, persuasive
My client needs a strong defense. You're the solution

[BURR]
Who's your client?

[HAMILTON]
The new U.S. Constitution?

[BURR]
No

[HAMILTON]
Hear me out

[BURR]
No way!

[HAMILTON]
A series of essays, anonymously published
Defending the document to the public

[BURR]
No one will read it

[HAMILTON]
I disagree

[BURR]
And if it fails?

[HAMILTON]
Burr, that's why we need it

[BURR]
The constitution's a mess

[HAMILTON]
So it needs amendments

[BURR]
It's full of contradictions

[HAMILTON]
So is independence
We have to start somewhere

[BURR]
No. No way

[HAMILTON]
You're making a mistake

[BURR]
Good night

[HAMILTON]
Hey
What are you waiting for?
What do you stall for?

[BURR]
What?

[HAMILTON]
We won the war
What was it all for?
Do you support this constitution?

[BURR]
Of course

[HAMILTON]
Then defend it

[BURR]
And what if you're backing the wrong horse?

[HAMILTON]
Burr, we studied and we fought and we killed
For the notion of a nation we now get to build
For once in your life, take a stand with pride
I don't understand how you stand to the side

[BURR]
I'll keep all my plans
Close to my chest

I'll wait here and see
Which way the wind
Will blow
I'm taking my time
Watching the
Afterbirth of a nation
Watching the tension grow.

[ENSEMBLE]
Wait for it, wait for
It, wait...

Which way the wind
Will blow
I'm taking my time
Watching the
Afterbirth of a nation
Watching the tension grow.

[ANGELICA]
I am sailing off to London. I'm accompanied by someone
Who always pays
I have found a wealthy husband who will keep
Me in comfort for all my days

Can match you for turn of phrase
My Alexander

[ANGELICA]
Don't forget to write

[ELIZA]
Look at where you are
Look at where you started
The fact that you're alive is a miracle
Just stay alive, that would be enough
And if your wife could share a fraction of your time
If I could grant you peace of mind
Would that be enough?

[BURR]
Alexander joins forces with James Madison and John Jay to write a series of essays defending the new United States Constitution, entitled The Federalist Papers. The plan was to write a total of twenty-five essays, the work divided evenly among the three men. In the end, they wrote eighty-five essays, in the span of six months. John Jay got sick after writing five. James Madison wrote twenty-nine. Hamilton wrote the other fifty-one!

[BURR]
How do you write like you're
Running out of time?
Write day and night like you're
Running out of time?

[BURR AND MEN]
Ev'ry day you fight
Like you're
Running out of time
Like you're
Running out of time
Are you
Running out of time?

Running out of time?
Running out of time
Running out of time

How do you write like tomorrow won't arrive?
How do you write like you need it to survive?
How do you write ev'ry second you're alive?
Ev'ry second you're alive? Ev'ry second you're alive?

[WASHINGTON]
They are asking me to lead
I am doing the best I can
To get the people that I need
I'm asking you to be my right hand man

[HAMILTON]
Treasury or State?

How does a bastard, orphan, son of a whore and a
Scotsman, dropped in the middle of a
Forgotten spot in the Caribbean by providence
Impoverished, in squalor
Grow up to be a hero and a scholar?

[LAURENS]
The ten-dollar founding father without a father
Got a lot farther by working a lot harder
By being a lot smarter
By being a self-starter
By fourteen, they placed him in charge of a
Trading charter

[JEFFERSON]
And every day while slaves were being slaughtered and carted
Away across the waves, he struggled and kept his guard up
Inside, he was longing for something to be a part of
The brother was ready to beg, steal, borrow, or barter

[MADISON]
Then a hurricane came, and devastation reigned
Our man saw his future drip, dripping down the drain
Put a pencil to his temple, connected it to his brain
And he wrote his first refrain, a testament to his pain

[BURR]
Well, the word got around, they said, "This kid is insane, man"
Took up a collection just to send him to the mainland
"Get your education, don't forget from whence you came, and
The world is gonna know your name. What's your name, man?"

[HAMILTON]
Alexander Hamilton
My name is Alexander Hamilton
And there's a million things I haven't done
But just you wait, just you wait...

[ELIZA]
When he was ten his father split, full of it, debt-ridden
Two years later, see Alex and his mother bed-ridden
Half-dead sittin in their own sick, the scent thick

[COMPANY]
And Alex got better but his mother went quick

[WASHINGTON]
Moved in with a cousin, the cousin committed suicide
Left him with nothin' but ruined pride, something new inside
A voice saying
[WASHINGTON]
"You gotta fend for yourself." [COMPANY]
"Alex, you gotta fend for yourself."

[WASHINGTON]
He started retreatin' and readin' every treatise on the shelf
[BURR]
There would have been nothin' left to do
For someone less astute
He woulda been dead or destitute
Without a cent of restitution
Started workin', clerkin' for his late mother's landlord
Tradin' sugar cane and rum and all the things he can't afford
Scammin' for every book he can get his hands on
Plannin' for the future see him now as he stands on
The bow of a ship headed for a new land
In New York you can be a new man

In New York you can
Be a new man-
In New York you can

Aaron Burr, Sir

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[COMPANY]
1776. New York City

[HAMILTON]
Pardon me. Are you Aaron Burr, sir?

[BURR]
That depends. Who's asking?

[HAMILTON]
Oh, well, sure, sir
I'm Alexander Hamilton, I'm at your service, sir
I have been looking for you

[BURR]
I'm getting nervous

[HAMILTON]
Sir...
I heard your name at Princeton. I was seeking an accelerated course of study when I got sort of out of sorts with a buddy of yours. I may have punched him. It's a blur, sir. He handles the financials?

[BURR]
You punched the bursar

[HAMILTON]
Yes!
I wanted to do what you did. Graduate in two, then join the revolution. He looked at me like I was stupid, I'm not stupid

So how'd you do it? How'd you graduate so fast?

[BURR]
It was my parents' dying wish before they passed

[HAMILTON]
You're an orphan. Of course! I'm an orphan
God, I wish there was a war!
Then we could prove that we're worth more
Than anyone bargained for...

[BURR]
Can I buy you a drink?

[HAMILTON]
That would be nice

[BURR]
While we're talking, let me offer you some free advice
Talk less

[HAMILTON]
What?

[BURR]
Smile more

[HAMILTON]
Ha

[BURR]
Don't let them know what you're against or what you're for

[HAMILTON]
You can't be serious

[BURR]
You wanna get ahead?

[HAMILTON]
Yes

[BURR]
Fools who run their mouths off wind up dead

[LAURENS]
Yo yo yo yo yo!
What time is it?

[LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
Show time!

[BURR]
...like I said...

[LAURENS]
Show time! Show time! Yo!
I'm John Laurens in the place to be!
Two pints o' Sam Adams, but I'm workin' on three, uh!
Those redcoats don't want it with me!
Cuz I will pop chick-a pop these cops till I'm free!

[LAFAYETTE]
Oui oui, mon ami, je m'appelle Lafayette!
The Lancelot of the revolutionary set!
I came from afar just to say "Bonsoir!"
Tell the King "Casse toi!" Who's the best?
C'est moi!

[MULLIGAN]
Brrrah brraaah! I am Hercules Mulligan
Up in it, lovin' it, yes I heard ya mother said "Come again?"
Lock up ya daughters and horses, of course
It's hard to have intercourse over four sets of corsets...

[LAURENS]
No more sex, pour me another brew, son!
Let's raise a couple more...

[LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
To the revolution!

[LAURENS]
Well, if it ain't the prodigy of Princeton college!

[MULLIGAN]
Aaron Burr!

[LAURENS]
Give us a verse, drop some knowledge!

[BURR]
Good luck with that: you're takin' a stand
You spit. I'm ‘a sit. We'll see where we land

[LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
Boooo!

[LAURENS]
Burr, the revolution's imminent. What do you stall for?

[HAMILTON]
If you stand for nothing, Burr, what'll you fall for?
[LAURENS]
Ooh
Who are you? [MULLIGAN]
Ooh

Who are you? [LAFAYETTE]
Ooh

Who are you?

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE/LAURENS]
Ooh, who is this kid? What's he gonna do?

My Shot

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[HAMILTON]
I am not throwing away my shot!
I am not throwing away my shot!
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot!
I'm ‘a get a scholarship to King's College
I prob'ly shouldn't brag, but dag, I amaze and astonish
The problem is I got a lot of brains but no polish
I gotta holler just to be heard
With every word, I drop knowledge!
I'm a diamond in the rough, a shiny piece of coal
Tryin' to reach my goal. My power of speech: unimpeachable
Only nineteen but my mind is older
These New York City streets get colder, I shoulder
Ev'ry burden, ev'ry disadvantage
I have learned to manage, I don't have a gun to brandish
I walk these streets famished
The plan is to fan this spark into a flame
But damn, it's getting dark, so let me spell out the name
I am the-

[HAMILTON/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN/LAURENS]
A-L-E-X-A-N-D
E-R-we are-meant to be...

[HAMILTON]
A colony that runs independently
Meanwhile, Britain keeps shittin' on us endlessly
Essentially, they tax us relentlessly
Then King George turns around, runs a spending spree
He ain't ever gonna set his descendants free
So there will be a revolution in this century
Enter me!

[LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN/LAURENS]
(He says in parentheses)

[HAMILTON]
Don't be shocked when your hist'ry book mentions me
I will lay down my life if it sets us free
Eventually, you'll see my ascendancy
[HAMILTON]
And I am not throwing away
My shot
I am not throwing away
My shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot
[LAURENS]
My shot!

My shot!

And I'm not throwing away my shot.

[HAMILTON/MULLIGAN/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE]
I am not throwing away my shot
I am not throwing away my shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot
It's time to take a shot!

[LAFAYETTE]
I dream of life without a monarchy
The unrest in France will lead to ‘onarchy?
‘Onarchy? How you say, how you say, ‘anarchy?'
When I fight, I make the other side panicky
With my-

[HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
Shot!

[MULLIGAN]
Yo, I'm a tailor's apprentice
And I got y'all knuckleheads in loco parentis
I'm joining the rebellion cuz I know it's my chance
To socially advance, instead of sewin' some pants!
I'm gonna take a-

[HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
Shot!

[LAURENS]
But we'll never be truly free
Until those in bondage have the same rights as you and me
You and I. Do or die. Wait till I sally in
On a stallion with the first black battalion
Have another-

[HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
Shot!

[BURR]
Geniuses, lower your voices
You keep out of trouble and you double your choices
I'm with you, but the situation is fraught
You've got to be carefully taught:
If you talk, you're gonna get shot!

[HAMILTON]
Burr, check what we got
Mister Lafayette, hard rock like Lancelot
I think your pants look hot
Laurens, I like you a lot
Let's hatch a plot blacker than the kettle callin' the pot...
What are the odds the gods would put us all in one spot
Poppin' a squat on conventional wisdom, like it or not
A bunch of revolutionary manumission abolitionists?
Give me a position, show me where the ammunition is!

Oh, am I talkin' too loud?
Sometimes I get over excited, shoot off at the mouth
I never had a group of friends before
I promise that I'll make y'all proud

[LAURENS]
Let's get this guy in front of a crowd

[HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN/ENSEMBLE]
I am not throwing away my shot
I am not throwing away my shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot

I am not throwing away my shot
I am not throwing away my shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot
[LAURENS]
Ev'rybody sing:
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Hey!
Whoa!
Wooh!!
Whoa!
Ay, let ‘em hear ya!

Let's go!

I said shout it to the rooftops!
Said, to the rooftops!
Come on!

Come on, let's go! [HAMILTON/LAFAYETTE/
MULLIGAN]
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

Whoa!

Whoa!

Yea!

[COMPANY]
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

[LAURENS]
Rise up!
When you're living on your knees, you rise up
Tell your brother that he's gotta rise up
Tell your sister that she's gotta rise up
[LAURENS AND ENSEMBLE]
When are these colonies gonna rise up?
When are these colonies gonna rise up?
When are these colonies gonna rise up?
When are these colonies gonna rise up?

Rise up!
[COMPANY]
Whoa! Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!

Rise up!

[HAMILTON]
I imagine death so much it feels more like a memory
When's it gonna get me?
In my sleep? Seven feet ahead of me?
If I see it comin', do I run or do I let it be?
Is it like a beat without a melody?
See, I never thought I'd live past twenty
Where I come from some get half as many
Ask anybody why we livin' fast and we laugh, reach for a flask
We have to make this moment last, that's plenty

Scratch that
This is not a moment, it's the movement
Where all the hungriest brothers with
Something to prove went?
Foes oppose us, we take an honest stand
We roll like Moses, claimin' our promised land
And? If we win our independence?
‘Zat a guarantee of freedom for our descendants?
Or will the blood we shed begin an endless
Cycle of vengeance and death with no defendants?
I know the action in the street is excitin'
But Jesus, between all the bleedin' ‘n fightin'
I've been readin' ‘n writin'
We need to handle our financial situation
Are we a nation of states? What's the state of our nation?
I'm past patiently waitin'. I'm passionately
Smashin' every expectation
Every action's an act of creation!
I'm laughin' in the face of casualties and sorrow
For the first time, I'm thinkin' past tomorrow

[HAMILTON AND COMPANY]
And I am not throwing away my shot
I am not throwing away my shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry

There's nothing rich folks love more
Than going downtown and slummin' it with the poor
They pull up in their carriages and gawk
At the students in the common

Take Philip Schuyler: the man is loaded
Uh-oh, but little does he know that
His daughters, Peggy, Angelica, Eliza
Sneak into the city just to watch all the guys at-

You searchin for an urchin who can give you ideals?

Ah, so you've discussed me

Farmer Refuted

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[SEABURY]
Hear ye, hear ye! My name is Samuel Seabury
And I present "Free Thoughts on the
Proceedings of the Continental Congress!"
Heed not the rabble who scream revolution
They have not your interests at heart

[MULLIGAN]
Oh my God. Tear this dude apart

[SEABURY]
Chaos and bloodshed are not a solution
Don't let them lead you astray
This Congress does not speak for me

[BURR]
Let him be

[SEABURY]
They're playing a dangerous game
I pray the king shows you his mercy
For shame, for shame...
[HAMILTON]
Yo!
He'd have you all unravel at the
Sound of screams but the
Revolution is comin'
The have-nots are gonna
Win this
It's hard to listen to you with a straight face

Chaos and bloodshed already haunt us, honestly you shouldn't even talk. And what about Boston? Look at the cost, n' all that we've lost n' you talk
About Congress?!

My dog speaks more eloquently than thee!

But strangely, your mange is the same

Is he in Jersey?

For the revolution!
[SEABURY]
Heed not the rabble
Who scream
Revolution, they
Have not your
Interests
At heart

Chaos and bloodshed are
Not a
Solution. Don't
Let them lead you
Astray
This Congress does not
Speak for me

They're playing a dangerous game

I pray the king shows you his mercy

For shame

For shame,

[COMPANY]
For the revolution!

[SEABURY]
Heed-

[HAMILTON]
If you repeat yourself again I'm gonna-

[SEABURY/HAMILTON]
Scream-

[HAMILTON]
Honestly, look at me, please don't read!

[SEABURY]
Not your interests-

[HAMILTON]
Don't modulate the key then not debate with me!
Why should a tiny island across the sea regulate the price of tea?

[BURR]
Alexander, please!

[HAMILTON]
Burr, I'd rather be divisive than indecisive, drop the niceties

[ENSEMBLE]
Silence! A message from the King!

You'll Be Back

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[KING GEORGE]
You say
The price of my love's not a price that you're willing to pay
You cry
In your tea which you hurl in the sea when you see me go by
Why so sad?
Remember we made an arrangement when you went away
Now you're making me mad
Remember, despite our estrangement, I'm your man
You'll be back
Soon you'll see
You'll remember you belong to me
You'll be back
Time will tell
You'll remember that I served you well
Oceans rise
Empires fall
We have seen each other through it all
And when push
Comes to shove
I will send a fully armed battalion
To remind you of my love!

Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da
Da da dat dat da ya da!
Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da
Da da dat dat da...

You say our love is draining and you can't go on
You'll be the one complaining when I am gone...
And no, don't change the subject
Cuz you're my favorite subject
My sweet, submissive subject
My loyal, royal subject
Forever and ever and ever and ever and ever...

You'll be back
Like before
I will fight the fight and win the war
For your love
For your praise
And I'll love you till my dying days
When you're gone
I'll go mad
So don't throw away this thing we had

Cuz when push comes to shove
I will kill your friends and family to remind you of my love
Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da
Da da dat dat da ya da!
Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da
Da da dat-
Everybody!

[ENSEMBLE]
Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da
Da da dat dat da ya da!

Ayo, I'm gonna need a right-hand man.
ENSEMBLE
What?

What?

Buck, buck, buck, buck, buck!

Buck, buck, buck, buck, buck!

[WASHINGTON]
Check it-
Can I be real a second?
For just a millisecond?
Let down my guard and tell the people how I feel a second?
Now I'm the model of a modern major general
The venerated Virginian veteran whose men are all
Lining up, to put me up on a pedestal
Writin' letters to relatives
Embellishin' my elegance and eloquence
But the elephant is in the room
The truth is in ya face when ya hear the British cannons go...

[ENSEMBLE]
Boom!

[WASHINGTON]
Any hope of success is fleeting
How can I keep leading when the people I'm
Leading keep retreating?
We put a stop to the bleeding as the British take Brooklyn
Knight takes rook, but look
[WASHINGTON]
We are outgunned

Outmanned

Outnumbered
Outplanned

We gotta make an all out stand
Ayo, I'm gonna need a right-hand man

Incoming!

Hamilton won't abandon ship
Yo, let's steal their cannons-
[MULLIGAN]
Shh-boom! [COMPANY]

Goes the cannon, watch the blood and the shit spray and...

[COMPANY]

[WASHINGTON]
There's another ship and...

[COMPANY]
Boom!

[WASHINGTON]
We just lost the southern tip and...

[COMPANY]
Boom!

[WASHINGTON]
We gotta run to Harlem quick, we can't afford another slip
Guns and horses giddyup
I decide to divvy up
My forces, they're skittish as the British cut the city up
This close to giving up, facing mad scrutiny
I scream in the face of this mass mutiny:
Are these the men with which I am to defend America?
We ride at midnight, Manhattan in the distance
I cannot be everywhere at once, people
I'm in dire need of assistance...

[BURR]
Your excellency, sir!

[WASHINGTON]
Who are you?

[BURR]
Aaron Burr, Sir?
Permission to state my case?

[WASHINGTON]
As you were

[BURR]
Sir
I was a captain under General Montgomery
Until he caught a bullet in the neck in Quebec
And well, in summary
I think that I could be of some assistance
I admire how you keep firing on the British
From a distance

[WASHINGTON]
Huh

[BURR]
I have some questions, a couple of suggestions on how to fight instead of fleeing west

[WASHINGTON]
Yes?

[BURR]
Well-

[HAMILTON]
Your excellency, you wanted to see me?

[WASHINGTON]
Hamilton, come in, have you met Burr?

[HAMILTON]
Yes, sir

[HAMILTON AND BURR]
We keep meeting

[BURR]
As I was saying, sir, I look forward to seeing your strategy play out

[WASHINGTON]
Burr?

[BURR]
Sir?

[WASHINGTON]
Close the door on your way out

[HAMILTON]
Have I done something wrong, sir?

[WASHINGTON]
On the contrary
I called you here because our odds are beyond scary
Your reputation precedes you, but I have to laugh

[HAMILTON]
Sir?

[WASHINGTON]
Hamilton, how come no one can get you on their staff?

[HAMILTON]
Sir!

[WASHINGTON]
Don't get me wrong, you're a young man, of great renown
I know you stole British cannons when we were still downtown
Nathaniel Green and Henry Knox wanted to hire you...

[HAMILTON]
To be their Secretary? I don't think so

[WASHINGTON]
Why're you upset?

[HAMILTON]
I'm not-

[WASHINGTON]
It's alright, you want to fight, you've got a hunger
I was just like you when I was younger
Head full of fantasies of dyin' like a martyr?

[HAMILTON]
Yes

[WASHINGTON]
Dying is easy, young man. Living is harder

[HAMILTON]
Why are you telling me this?

[WASHINGTON]
I'm being honest
I'm working with a third of what our Congress has promised
We are a powder keg about to explode
I need someone like you to lighten the load. So?

[COMPANY (EXCEPT HAMILTON)]
I am not throwin' away my shot!
I am not throwin' away my shot!
Ayo, I'm just like my country, I'm young
Scrappy and hungry!

[HAMILTON]
I am not throwing away my shot!

[WASHINGTON]

[WASHINGON AND COMPANY]
We are outgunned, outmanned!

[HAMILTON]
You need all the help you can get
I have some friends. Laurens, Mulligan
Marquis de Lafayette, okay, what else?

[WASHINGTON AND COMPANY]
Outnumbered, outplanned!

[HAMILTON]
We'll need some spies on the inside
Some King's men who might let some things slide
[HAMILTON]
I'll write to Congress and tell ‘em we need supplies, you rally the guys, master the element of surprise

I'll rise above my station, organize your information, ‘til we rise to the occasion of our new nation. Sir!

A Winter's Ball

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[BURR]
How does the bastard, orphan, son of a whore
Go on and on
Grow into more of a phenomenon?
Watch this obnoxious, arrogant, loudmouth bother
Be seated at the right hand of the father
Washington hires Hamilton right on sight
But Hamilton still wants to fight, not write
Now Hamilton's skill with a quill is undeniable
But what do we have in common? We're
Reliable with the

[ALL MEN]
Ladies!

[BURR]
There are so many to deflower!

[ALL MEN]
Ladies!

[BURR]
Looks! Proximity to power

[ALL MEN]
Ladies!

[BURR]
They delighted and distracted him
Martha Washington named her feral tomcat after him!

[HAMILTON]
That's true

[FULL COMPANY]
1780

[BURR]
A winter's ball
And the Schuyler sisters are the envy of all
Yo, if you can marry a sister, you're rich, son

[HAMILTON]
Is it a question of if, Burr, or which one?

Helpless

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[HAMILTON/BURR/LAURENS/ALL WOMEN (EXCEPT ELIZA)]
Hey hey hey hey
[ELIZA]
Ohh, I do I do I do I
Dooo! Hey!
Ohh, I do I do I do I
Dooo! Boy you got me [ALL WOMEN]
Hey hey hey hey
Hey hey hey hey
Hey hey hey hey
Hey hey hey

[ELIZA AND WOMEN]
Helpless!
Look into your eyes, and the sky's the limit I'm helpless!
Down for the count, and I'm drownin' in ‘em

[ELIZA]
I have never been the type to try and grab the spotlight
We were at a revel with some rebels on a hot night
Laughin' at my sister as she's dazzling the room
Then you walked in and my heart went "Boom!"
Tryin' to catch your eye from the side of the ballroom
Everybody's dancin' and the band's top volume

[ELIZA AND WOMEN]
Grind to the rhythm as we wine and dine
[ELIZA]
Grab my sister, and
Whisper, "Yo, this
One's mine."

My sister made her way across the room to you
And I got nervous, thinking "What's she gonna do?"
She grabbed you by the arm, I'm thinkin' "I'm through"
Then you look back at me and suddenly I'm
Helpless!

Oh, look at those eyes

Oh!
Yeah, I'm
Helpless, I know

I'm so into you
I am so into you

I know I'm down for the count
And I'm drownin' in ‘em.

[ALL WOMEN]
Oooh

Oooh

Oooh

Oooh

Helpless!

Look into your eyes
And the sky's the limit
I'm
Helpless!
Down for the count
And I'm drownin' in ‘em

I'm helpless!

Look into your eyes
And the sky's the limit I'm helpless!

Down for the count
And I'm drownin' in ‘em.

[HAMILTON]
Where are you taking me?

[ANGELICA]
I'm about to change your life

[HAMILTON]
Then by all means, lead the way

[ELIZA]
Elizabeth Schuyler. It's a pleasure to meet you

[HAMILTON]
Schuyler?

[ANGELICA]
My sister

[ELIZA]
Thank you for all your service

[HAMILTON]
If it takes fighting a war for us to meet, it will have been worth it

[ANGELICA]
I'll leave you to it

[ELIZA AND WOMEN]
One week later

[ELIZA]
I'm writin' a letter nightly
Now my life gets better, every letter that you write me
Laughin' at my sister, cuz she wants to form a harem

[ANGELICA]
I'm just sayin', if you really loved me, you would share him
[ELIZA]
Ha!
Two weeks later
In the living room stressin'
My father's stone-faced
While you're asking for his blessin'
I'm dying inside, as
You wine
And dine
And I'm tryin' not to cry
‘cause there's nothing that your mind can't do
My father makes his way across the room
To you
I panic for a second, thinking
"we're through"
But then he shakes your hand and says
"Be true"
And you turn back to me, smiling, and I'm
Helpless!

Helpless!
Hoo!

That boy is mine
That boy is mine!

Helpless! Helpless!
Down for the count
And I'm drownin' in em

[ALL WOMEN]
Stressin'

Blessin'

Oooh

Oooh

Oooh

Oooh

Look into your eyes
And the sky's the

Down for the count
And I'm drownin' in
‘em I'm
Helpless!

Look into your eyes
And the sky's the
Limit I'm
Helpless!
Down for the count
And I'm drownin' in em

[HAMILTON]
Eliza, I don't have a dollar to my name
An acre of land, a troop to command, a dollop of fame
All I have's my honor, a tolerance for pain
A couple of college credits and my top-notch brain
Insane, your family brings out a different side of me
Peggy confides in me, Angelica tried to take a bite of me
No stress, my love for you is never in doubt
We'll get a little place in Harlem and we'll figure it out
I've been livin' without a family since I was a child
My father left, my mother died, I grew up buckwild
But I'll never forget my mother's face, that was real
And long as I'm alive, Eliza, swear to God
You'll never feel so...

[HAMILTON]
Eliza...

I've never felt so-

My life is gon' be fine cuz Eliza's in it.
[ELIZA]
I do I do I do I do!

I do I do I do I do!

Hey, yeah, yeah!

I'm down for the count
I'm-

I look into your eyes, and the sky's the limit
I'm

...drownin' in ‘em. [ALL WOMEN]
Helpless!

Helpless!

Helpless!

Down for the count
And I'm drownin' in ‘em

Helpless!

Helpless!

Helpless!

Down for the count
And I'm drownin' in ‘em.

Satisfied

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[LAURENS]
Alright, alright. That's what I'm talkin' about!
Now everyone give it up for the maid of honor
Angelica Schuyler!
[ANGELICA]
A toast to the groom!

To the bride!

From your sister

Who is always by your side

To your union

And the hope that you provide

May you always...

Be satisfied.

[ALL MEN]
To the groom!
To the groom!
To the groom!

To the bride!
To the bride!

Angelica!
Angelica!
Angelica!

By your side!

To the union!
To the revolution!

You provide!
You provide!

[HAMILTON AND MEN]
Always-

Rewind-

[ALL WOMEN]
To the groom!

To the bride!

To the bride!

[ELIZA AND WOMEN]
Angelica!

By your side!

To the union!
To the revolution!

You provide!

Always-

Rewind-

[ANGELICA]
I remember that night, I just might
Regret that night for the rest of my days

I remember those soldier boys
Tripping over themselves to win our praise

I remember that dreamlike candlelight
Like a dream that you can't quite place

But Alexander, I'll never forget the first
Time I saw your face

I have never been the same
Intelligent eyes in a hunger-pang frame
And when you said "Hi," I forgot my dang name
Set my heart aflame, ev'ry part aflame

[FULL COMPANY]
This is not a game...

[HAMILTON]
You strike me as a woman who has never been satisfied

[ANGELICA]
I'm sure I don't know what you mean. You forget yourself

[HAMILTON]
You're like me. I'm never satisfied

[ANGELICA]
Is that right?

[HAMILTON]
I have never been satisfied

[ANGELICA]
My name is Angelica Schuyler

[HAMILTON]
Alexander Hamilton

[ANGELICA]
Where's your fam'ly from?

[HAMILTON]
Unimportant. There's a million things I haven't done but
Just you wait, just you wait...

[ANGELICA]
So so so-
So this is what it feels like to match wits
With someone at your level! What the hell is the catch? It's
The feeling of freedom, of seein' the light
It's Ben Franklin with a key and a kite! You see it, right?
The conversation lasted two minutes, maybe three minutes
Ev'rything we said in total agreement, it's
A dream and it's a bit of a dance
A bit of a posture, it's a bit of a stance. He's a
Bit of a flirt, but I'm ‘a give it a chance
I asked about his fam'ly, did you see his answer?
His hands started fidgeting, he looked askance?
He's penniless, he's flying by the seat of his pants

Handsome, boy, does he know it!
Peach fuzz, and he can't even grow it!
I wanna take him far away from this place
Then I turn and see my sister's face and she is...

[ELIZA]
Helpless...

[ANGELICA]
And I know she is...

[ELIZA]
Helpless...

[ANGELICA]
And her eyes are just...

[ELIZA]
Helpless...

[ANGELICA]
And I realize

[ANGELICA AND COMPANY]
Three fundamental truths at the exact same time...

[HAMILTON]
Where are you taking me?

[ANGELICA]
I'm about to change your life

[HAMILTON]
Then by all means, lead the way

[COMPANY (EXCEPT ANGELICA)]
Number one!

[ANGELICA]
I'm a girl in a world in which
My only job is to marry rich
My father has no sons so I'm the one
Who has to social climb for one
So I'm the oldest and the wittiest and the gossip in
New York City is insidious
Alexander is penniless
Ha! That doesn't mean I want him any less

[ELIZA]
Elizabeth Schuyler. It's a pleasure to meet you

[HAMILTON]
Schuyler?

[ANGELICA]
My sister

[COMPANY]
Number two!

[ANGELICA]
He's after me cuz I'm a Schuyler sister
That elevates his status, I'd
Have to be naïve to set that aside
Maybe that is why I introduce him to Eliza
Now that's his bride
Nice going, Angelica, he was right
You will never be satisfied

[ELIZA]
Thank you for all your service

[HAMILTON]
If it takes fighting a war for us to meet, it will have been worth it

[ANGELICA]
I'll leave you to it

[COMPANY]
Number three!

[ANGELICA]
I know my sister like I know my own mind
You will never find anyone as trusting or as kind
If I tell her that I love him she'd be silently resigned
He'd be mine
She would say, "I'm fine"

[ANGELICA AND COMPANY]
She'd be lying

[ANGELICA]
But when I fantasize at night
It's Alexander's eyes
As I romanticize what might
Have been if I hadn't sized him
Up so quickly
At least my dear Eliza's his wife;
At least I keep his eyes in my life...
[ANGELICA]
To the groom!

To the bride!

From your sister

Who is always by your side

To your union

And the hope that you provide

May you always

Be satisfied

And I know

She'll be happy as

His bride
And I know [ALL MEN (EXCEPT HAMILTON)]
To the groom!
To the groom!
To the groom!

To the bride!
To the bride!

Angelica!
Angelica!

By your side

To the union!
To the revolution!

You provide!
You provide!

[HAMILTON AND MEN]
Always-

Be satisfied

Be satisfied

[MEN]
Be satisfied
Be satisfied
Be satisfied
Be satisfied

Be satisfied
Be satisfied

Be satisfied
Be satisfied
Be satisfied

[ALL WOMEN (EXCEPT ELIZA)]

The Story of Tonight (Reprise)

[LAURENS]
I may not live to see our glory!

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE]
I may not live to see our glory!

[LAURENS]
But I've seen wonders great and small

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE]
I've seen wonders great and small

[LAURENS]
‘Cause if the tomcat can get married

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE]
If Alexander can get married-

[LAURENS]
There's hope for our ass, after all!

[LAFAYETTE]
Raise a glass to freedom

[LAURENS/MULLIGAN]
Hey!
Something you will never see again!

[MULLIGAN]
No matter what she tells you

[LAFAYETTE]
Let's have another round tonight!

[LAURENS]
Raise a glass to the four of us!

[LAFAYETTE/HAMILTON]
Ho!

[MULLIGAN]
To the newly not poor of us!

[LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/HAMILTON]
Woo!

[LAFAYETTE]
We'll tell the story of tonight

[LAURENS]
Let's have another round-

[HAMILTON]
Well, if it isn't Aaron Burr

[BURR]
Sir!

[HAMILTON]
I didn't think that you would make it

[BURR]
To be sure

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE]
Burr!

[BURR]
I came to say congratulations

[MULLIGAN]
Spit a verse, Burr!

[BURR]
I see the whole gang is here

[LAFAYETTE]
You are the worst, Burr!

[HAMILTON]
Ignore them. Congrats to you, Lieutenant Colonel
I wish I had your command instead of manning George's journal

[BURR]
No, you don't

[HAMILTON]
Yes, I do

[BURR]
Now, be sensible
From what I hear, you've made yourself indispensable

[LAURENS]
Well, well, I heard
You've got a special someone on the side, Burr

[HAMILTON]
Is that so?

[LAURENS]
What are you tryin' to hide, Burr?

[BURR]
I should go

[HAMILTON]
No, these guys should go

[LAFAYETTE]
What?

[LAURENS]
No!

[HAMILTON]
Leave us alone

[MULLIGAN]
Man...

[HAMILTON]
It's alright, Burr. I wish you'd brought this girl with you tonight, Burr

[BURR]
You're very kind, but I'm afraid it's unlawful, sir

[HAMILTON]
What do you mean?

[BURR]
She's married

[HAMILTON]
I see

[BURR]
She's married to a British officer

[HAMILTON]
Oh shit...

[BURR]
Congrats again, Alexander. Smile more
I'll see you on the other side of the war

[HAMILTON]
I will never understand you
If you love this woman, go get her! What are you waiting for?

[BURR]
I'll see you on the other side of the war

[HAMILTON]
I'll see you on the other side of the war

Wait For It

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[BURR]
Theodosia writes me a letter everyday
I'm keeping the bed warm while her husband is away
He's on the British side in Georgia
He's trying to keep the colonies in line
But he can keep all of Georgia
Theodosia, she's mine

Love doesn't discriminate
Between the sinners
And the saints
It takes and it takes and it takes
And we keep loving anyway
We laugh and we cry
And we break
And we make our mistakes
And if there's a reason I'm by her side
When so many have tried
Then I'm willing to wait for it
I'm willing to wait for it
[BURR]
My grandfather was a fire and brimstone preacher

But there are things that the
Homilies and hymns won't teach ya

My mother was a genius

My father commanded respect

When they died they left no instructions
Just a legacy to protect

[MEN]
Preacher, preacher
Preacher

Teach ya, teach ya, teach ya

Respect, respect

[WOMEN]
Genius

[BURR/ENSEMBLE]
Death doesn't discriminate
Between the sinners
And the saints
It takes and it takes and it takes
And we keep living anyway
We rise and we fall
And we break
And we make our mistakes
And if there's a reason I'm still alive
When everyone who loves me has died
I'm willing to wait for it
I'm willing to wait for it

Wait for it

Wait for it
Wait for it
Wait for it

I am the one thing in life I can control

Hamilton faces an endless uphill climb

[ENSEMBLE]
Climb

[BURR]
He has something to prove
He has nothing to lose

[BURR]
Hamilton's pace is relentless
He wastes no time

[ENSEMBLE]
Time

[BURR]
What is it like in his shoes?

Hamilton doesn't hesitate
He exhibits no restraint
He takes and he takes and he takes
And he keeps winning anyway
He changes the game
He plays and he raises the stakes
And if there's a reason
He seems to thrive when so few survive, then Goddamnit-
[BURR]
I'm willing to wait for it

I'm willing to wait for it...

Life doesn't discriminate
Between the sinners and the saints
It takes and it takes and it takes

We rise
We fall

And if there's a reason I'm still alive
When so many have died
Then I'm willin' to-

Stay Alive

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[ELIZA]
Stay alive...

[ELIZA/ANGELICA/ENSEMBLE WOMEN]
Stay alive...

[HAMILTON]
I have never seen the General so despondent
I have taken over writing all his correspondence
Congress writes, "George, attack the British forces."
I shoot back, we have resorted to eating our horses
Local merchants deny us equipment, assistance
They only take British money, so sing a song of sixpence

[WASHINGTON]
The cavalry's not coming

[HAMILTON]
Sir!

[WASHINGTON]
Alex, listen. There's only one way for us to win this
Provoke outrage, outright

[HAMILTON]
That's right

[WASHINGTON]
Don't engage, strike by night
Remain relentless ‘til their troops take flight

[HAMILTON]
Make it impossible to justify the cost of the fight

[WASHINGTON]
Outrun

[HAMILTON]
Outrun

[WASHINGTON]
Outlast

[HAMILTON]
Outlast

[WASHINGTON]
Hit ‘em quick, get out fast

[HAMILTON]
Chick-a-plao!

[WASHINGTON]
Stay alive ‘til this horror show is past
We're gonna fly a lot of flags half-mast

[HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE]
Raise a glass!

[MULLIGAN]
I go back to New York and my apprenticeship

[LAFAYETTE]
I ask for French aid, I pray that France has sent a ship

[LAURENS]
I stay at work with Hamilton
We write essays against slavery
And every day's a test of our camaraderie
And bravery

[HAMILTON]
We cut supply lines, we steal contraband
We pick and choose our battles and places to take a stand
And ev'ry day
"Sir, entrust me with a command,"
And ev'ry day

[WASHINGTON]
No

[HAMILTON]
He dismisses me out of hand
[HAMILTON]
Instead of me
He promotes
Charles Lee
Makes him second-in-command:

[LEE]
Charles Lee. [ELIZA/ANGELICA]
Stay alive...

[LEE]
I'm a General. Whee!!!!

[HAMILTON]
Yeah. He's not the choice I would have gone with

[HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE]
He shits the bed at the Battle of Monmouth

[WASHINGTON]
Ev'ryone attack!

[LEE]
Retreat!

[WASHINGTON]
Attack!

[LEE]
Retreat!

[WASHINGTON]
What are you doing, Lee? Get back on your feet!

[LEE]
But there's so many of them!

[WASHINGTON]
I'm sorry, is this not your speed?!
Hamilton!

[HAMILTON]
Ready, sir!

[WASHINGTON]
Have Lafayette take the lead!

[HAMILTON]
Yes, sir!

[LAURENS]
A thousand soldiers die in a hundred degree heat

[LAFAYETTE]
As we snatch a stalemate from the jaws of defeat

[HAMILTON]
Charles Lee was left behind
Without a pot to piss in
He started sayin' this to anybody who would listen:

[LEE]
Washington cannot be left alone to his devices
Indecisive, from crisis to crisis
The best thing he can do for the revolution
Is turn n' go back to plantin' tobacco in Mount Vernon

[COMPANY]
Oo!!

[WASHINGTON]
Don't do a thing. History will prove him wrong

[HAMILTON]
But, sir!

[WASHINGTON]
We have a war to fight, let's move along

[LAURENS]
Strong words from Lee, someone oughta hold him to it

[HAMILTON]
I can't disobey direct orders

[LAURENS]
Then I'll do it
Alexander, you're the closest friend I've got

[HAMILTON]
Laurens, do not throw away your shot

Ten Duel Commandments

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[MEN]
One, two, three, four

[FULL COMPANY]
Five, six, seven, eight, nine...

[BURR/HAMILTON/LAURENS/LEE]
It's the Ten Duel Commandments

[FULL COMPANY]
It's the Ten Duel Commandments
Number one!

[LAURENS]
The challenge: demand satisfaction
If they apologize, no need for further action

[COMPANY]
Number two!

[LAURENS]
If they don't, grab a friend, that's your second

[HAMILTON]
Your lieutenant when there's reckoning to be reckoned

[COMPANY]
Number three!

[LEE]
Have your seconds meet face to face

[BURR]
Negotiate a peace...

[HAMILTON]
Or negotiate a time and place

[BURR]
This is commonplace, ‘specially ‘tween recruits

[COMPANY]
Most disputes die, and no one shoots
Number four!

[LAURENS]
If they don't reach a peace, that's alright
Time to get some pistols and a doctor on site

[HAMILTON]
You pay him in advance, you treat him with civility

[BURR]
You have him turn around so he can have deniability

[COMPANY]
Five!

[LEE]
Duel before the sun is in the sky

[COMPANY]
Pick a place to die where it's high and dry
Number six!

[HAMILTON]
Leave a note for your next of kin
Tell ‘em where you been. Pray that hell or heaven lets you in

[COMPANY]
Seven!

[LEE]
Confess your sins. Ready for the moment of adrenaline when you finally face your opponent

[COMPANY]
Number eight!

[LAURENS/LEE/HAMILTON/BURR]
Your last chance to negotiate
Send in your seconds, see if they can set the record straight...

[BURR]
Alexander

[HAMILTON]
Aaron Burr, sir

[BURR]
Can we agree that duels are dumb and immature?

[HAMILTON]
Sure
But your man has to answer for his words, Burr

[BURR]
With his life? We both know that's absurd, sir

[HAMILTON]
Hang on, how many men died because Lee was inexperienced and ruinous?

[BURR]
Okay, so we're doin' this

[COMPANY]
Number nine!

[HAMILTON]
Look ‘em in the eye, aim no higher
Summon all the courage you require
Then count

[MEN]
One two three four

[FULL COMPANY]
Five six seven eight nine

Meet Me Inside

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[HAMILTON]
Lee, do you yield?

[BURR]
You shot him in the side!
Yes, he yields!

[LAURENS]
I'm satisfied

[BURR]
Yo, we gotta clear the field!

[HAMILTON]
Go! We won

[COMPANY]
Here comes the General!

[BURR]
This should be fun

[WASHINGTON]
What is the meaning of this? Mr. Burr, get a medic for the General

[BURR]
Yes, sir

[WASHINGTON]
Lee, you will never agree with me
But believe me, these young men don't speak for me
Thank you for your service

[BURR]
Let's ride!

[WASHINGTON]
Hamilton!

[HAMILTON]
Sir!

[WASHINGTON]
Meet me inside

[COMPANY]
Meet him inside! Meet him inside!
Meet him inside, meet him, meet him inside!

[WASHINGTON]
Son-

[HAMILTON]
Don't call me son

[WASHINGTON]
This war is hard enough
Without infighting-

[HAMILTON]
Lee called you out. We called his bluff

[WASHINGTON]
You solve nothing, you aggravate our allies to the south

[HAMILTON]
You're absolutely right, John should have shot him in the mouth
That would've shut him up

[WASHINGTON]
Son-

[HAMILTON]
I'm notcha son-

[WASHINGTON]
Watch your tone
I am not a maiden in need of defending, I am grown

[HAMILTON (OVERLAPPING)]
Charles Lee, Thomas Conway
These men take your name and they rake it
Through the mud

[WASHINGTON]
My name's been through a lot, I can take it

[HAMILTON]
Well, I don't have your name. I don't have your titles
I don't have your land
But, if you-

[WASHINGTON]
No-

[HAMILTON]
If you gave me command of a battalion, a group of men to lead, I could fly above my station after the war

[WASHINGTON]
Or you could die and we need you alive

[HAMILTON]
I'm more than willing to die-

[WASHINGTON]
Your wife needs you alive, son, I need you alive-

[HAMILTON]
Call me son one more time-

[WASHINGTON]
Go home, Alexander
That's an order from your commander

[HAMILTON]
Sir-

[WASHINGTON]
Go home

Look around, look around at how lucky we are
To be alive right now
Look around, look around...

[HAMILTON]
How long have you known?

[ELIZA]
A month or so

[HAMILTON]
Eliza, you should have told me

[ELIZA]
I wrote to the General a month ago

[HAMILTON]
No

[ELIZA]
I begged him to send you home

[HAMILTON]
You should have told me

[ELIZA]
I'm not sorry
[ELIZA]
I knew you'd fight
Until the war was won

But you deserve a chance to meet your son
Look around, look around at how lucky we are
To be alive right now.
[HAMILTON]
The war's not
Done.

[HAMILTON]
Will you relish being a poor man's wife
Unable to provide for your life?

[ELIZA]
I relish being your wife
Look around, look around...

Look at where you are
Look at where you started
The fact that you're alive is a miracle
Just stay alive, that would be enough

And if this child
Shares a fraction of your smile
Or a fragment of your mind, look out world!
That would be enough

I don't pretend to know
The challenges you're facing
The worlds you keep erasing and creating in your mind

But I'm not afraid
I know who I married
So long as you come home at the end of the day
That would be enough

We don't need a legacy
We don't need money
If I could grant you peace of mind

If you could let me inside your heart...
Oh, let me be a part of the narrative
In the story they will write someday
Let this moment be the first chapter:
Where you decide to stay
And I could be enough
And we could be enough
That would be enough

Guns and Ships

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[BURR]
How does a ragtag volunteer army in need of a shower
Somehow defeat a global superpower?
How do we emerge victorious from the quagmire?
Leave the battlefield waving Betsy Ross' flag higher?
Yo. Turns out we have a secret weapon!
An immigrant you know and love who's unafraid to step in!
He's constantly confusin', confoundin' the British henchmen
Ev'ryone give it up for America's favorite fighting Frenchman!

[COMPANY]
Lafayette!

[LAFAYETTE]
I'm takin this horse by the reins makin'
Redcoats redder with bloodstains

[COMPANY]
Lafayette!

[LAFAYETTE]
And I'm never gonna stop until I make ‘em
Drop and burn ‘em up and scatter their remains, I'm

[COMPANY]
Lafayette!

[LAFAYETTE]
Watch me engagin' em! Escapin' em!
Enragin' em! I'm-

[COMPANY]
Lafayette!

[LAFAYETTE]
I go to France for more funds

[COMPANY]
Lafayette!

[LAFAYETTE]
I come back with more

[LAFAYETTE AND ENSEMBLE]
Guns
And ships
And so the balance shifts

[WASHINGTON]
We rendezvous with Rochambeau, consolidate their gifts

[LAFAYETTE]
We can end this war at Yorktown, cut them off at sea, but
For this to succeed, there's someone else we need:

[WASHINGTON]
I know

[WASHINGTON AND COMPANY]
Hamilton!

[LAFAYETTE]
Sir, he knows what to do in a trench
Ingenuitive and fluent in French, ami-

[WASHINGTON AND COMPANY]
Hamilton!

[LAFAYETTE]
Sir, you're gonna have to use him eventually
What's he gonna do on the bench? I mean-

[WASHINGTON AND COMPANY]
Hamilton!

[LAFAYETTE]
No one has more resilience
Or matches my practical tactical brilliance-

[WASHINGTON AND COMPANY]
Hamilton!
[LAFAYETTE]
You wanna fight for your land back?

[WASHINGTON]
I need my right hand man back!

[LAFAYETTE]
Ah! Uh, get ya right hand man back
You know you gotta get ya right hand man back

I mean you gotta put some thought into the letter but the sooner the better
To get your right hand man back!

[COMPANY]
Hamilton!

[WOMEN]
Hamilton!

Hamilton!

Hamilton, Hamilton!
Ha- ha-!

[MEN]
Get your right hand man back!

Your right hand man back!

Hamilton!
Ha-
Ha-

Hamilton, Hamilton!
Ha- ha-!

[WASHINGTON]
Alexander Hamilton
Troops are waiting in the field for you
If you join us right now, together we can turn the tide
Oh, Alexander Hamilton
I have soldiers who will yield for you
If we manage to get this right
They'll surrender by early light
The world will never be the same, Alexander...

History Has Its Eyes On You

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[WASHINGTON]
I was younger than you are now
When I was given my first command
I led my men straight into a massacre
I witnessed their deaths firsthand
I made every mistake
I felt the shame rise in me
And even now I lie awake
[WASHINGTON]
Knowing history has its eyes on me

[HAMILTON/WASHINGTON]
History has its eyes on me. [LAURENS/MULLIGAN]
Whoa...
Whoa...
Whoa...
Yeah

[COMPANY]
Whoa...
Whoa...
Whoa...
Yeah

[WASHINGTON]
Let me tell you what I wish I'd known
When I was young and dreamed of glory:
You have no control:

[WASHINGTON AND COMPANY]
Who lives, who dies, who tells your story

[WASHINGTON]
I know that we can win
I know that greatness lies in you
But remember from here on in
[WASHINGTON/HAMILTON AND MEN]
History has its
Eyes on you.

[ENSEMBLE]
Whoa...
Whoa...
Whoa...

History has its eyes on you

Yorktown (The World Turned Upside Down)

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[COMPANY]
The battle of Yorktown. 1781

[LAFAYETTE]
Monsieur Hamilton

[HAMILTON]
Monsieur Lafayette

[LAFAYETTE]
In command where you belong

[HAMILTON]
How you say, no sweat
We're finally on the field. We've had quite a run

[LAFAYETTE]
Immigrants:

[HAMILTON/LAFAYETTE]
We get the job done

[HAMILTON]
So what happens if we win?

[LAFAYETTE]
I go back to France
I bring freedom to my people if I'm given the chance

[HAMILTON]
We'll be with you when you do

[LAFAYETTE]
Go lead your men

[HAMILTON]
See you on the other side

[LAFAYETTE]
‘Til we meet again, let's go!

[ENSEMBLE]
I am not throwin' away my shot!
I am not throwin' away my shot!
Hey yo, I'm just like my country, I'm young
Scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwin' away my shot!
I am not throwin' away my shot!

[HAMILTON]
‘Til the world turns upside down...

[ENSEMBLE]
‘Til the world turns upside down!

[HAMILTON]
I imagine death so much it feels more like a memory
This is where it gets me: on my feet
The enemy ahead of me
If this is the end of me, at least I have a friend with me
Weapon in my hand, a command, and my men with me
Then I remember my Eliza's expecting me...
Not only that, my Eliza's expecting
We gotta go, gotta get the job done
Gotta start a new nation, gotta meet my son!
Take the bullets out your gun!

[ENSEMBLE]
What?

[HAMILTON]
The bullets out your gun!

[ENSEMBLE]
What?

[HAMILTON]
We move under cover and we move as one
Through the night, we have one shot to live another day
We cannot let a stray gunshot give us away
We will fight up close, seize the moment and stay in it
It's either that or meet the business end of a bayonet
The code word is ‘Rochambeau,' dig me?

[ENSEMBLE]
Rochambeau!

[HAMILTON]
You have your orders now, go, man, go!
And so the American experiment begins
With my friends all scattered to the winds
Laurens is in South Carolina, redefining brav'ry

[HAMILTON/LAURENS]
We'll never be free until we end slavery!

[HAMILTON]
When we finally drive the British away
Lafayette is there waiting-

[HAMILTON/LAFAYETTE]
In Chesapeake Bay!

[HAMILTON]
How did we know that this plan would work?
We had a spy on the inside. That's right

[HAMILTON/COMPANY]
Hercules Mulligan!

[MULLIGAN]
A tailor spyin' on the British government!
I take their measurements, information and then I smuggle it

[COMPANY]
Up

[MULLIGAN]
To my brother's revolutionary covenant
I'm runnin' with the Sons of Liberty and I am lovin' it!
See, that's what happens when you up against the ruffians
We in the shit now, somebody gotta shovel it!
Hercules Mulligan, I need no introduction
When you knock me down I get the fuck back up again!

[COMPANY]
Left! Right! Hold!
Go!
What! What! What!

[HAMILTON]
After a week of fighting, a young man in a red coat stands on a parapet

[LAFAYETTE]
We lower our guns as he frantically waves a white handkerchief

[MULLIGAN]
And just like that, it's over. We tend to our wounded, we count our dead

[LAURENS]
Black and white soldiers wonder alike if this really means freedom

[WASHINGTON]
Not. Yet

[HAMILTON]
We negotiate the terms of surrender
I see George Washington smile
We escort their men out of Yorktown
They stagger home single file
Tens of thousands of people flood the streets
There are screams and church bells ringing
And as our fallen foes retreat
I hear the drinking song they're singing...

[ALL MEN]
The world turned upside down

[FULL COMPANY]
The world turned upside down
The world turned upside down
The world turned upside down
Down
Down, down, down

[LAFAYETTE]
Freedom for America, freedom for France!

[COMPANY]
Down, down, down

[HAMILTON]
Gotta start a new nation
Gotta meet my son

[COMPANY]
Down, down, down

[MULLIGAN]
We won!

[LAFAYETTE]
We won!

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE/LAURENS]
We won!

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE/LAURENS/HAMILTON/WASHINGTON]
We won!

[COMPANY]
The world turned upside down!

What Comes Next

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[KING GEORGE]
They say
The price of my war's not a price that they're willing to pay
Insane
You cheat with the French, now I'm fighting with France and with Spain
I'm so blue
I thought that we'd made an arrangement
When you went away
You were mine to subdue
Well, even despite our estrangement, I've got
A small query for you:

What comes next?
You've been freed
Do you know how hard it is to lead?

You're on your own
Awesome. Wow
Do you have a clue what happens now?

Oceans rise
Empires fall
It's much harder when it's all your call

All alone, across the sea
When your people say they hate you, don't
Come crawling back to me

Da da da dat da dat da da da
Da ya da
Da da dat
Da da ya da...

You're on your own...

Dear Theodosia

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[BURR]
Dear Theodosia, what to say to you?
You have my eyes. You have your mother's name

When you came into the world, you cried and it broke my heart

I'm dedicating every day to you
Domestic life was never quite my style
When you smile, you knock me out, I fall apart
And I thought I was so smart

You will come of age with our young nation
We'll bleed and fight for you, we'll make it right for you
If we lay a strong enough foundation
We'll pass it on to you, we'll give the world to you
And you'll blow us all away...
Someday, someday
Yeah, you'll blow us all away
Someday, someday

[HAMILTON]
Oh Philip, when you smile I am undone
My son
Look at my son. Pride is not the word I'm looking for

There is so much more inside me now
Oh Philip, you outshine the morning sun
My son
When you smile, I fall apart
And I thought I was so smart
My father wasn't around

[BURR]
My father wasn't around
[HAMILTON]
I swear that
I'll be around for you.
[BURR]
I'll be around for you.

[HAMILTON]
I'll do whatever it takes

[BURR]
I'll make a million mistakes

[BURR/HAMILTON]
I'll make the world safe and sound for you...
...will come of age with our young nation
We'll bleed and fight for you, we'll make it right for you

If we lay a strong enough foundation
We'll pass it on to you, we'll give the world to you
And you'll blow us all away...
Someday, someday
Yeah, you'll blow us all away
Someday, someday

Non-Stop

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[BURR]
After the war I went back to New York

[HAMILTON]
A-After the war I went back to New York

[BURR]
I finished up my studies and I practiced law

[HAMILTON]
I practiced law, Burr worked next door
[BURR]
Even though we started at the very same time
Alexander Hamilton began to climb
How to account for his rise to the top?
Maaaaan, the man is
Non-stop!

[ENSEMBLE]
Non-stop!

[HAMILTON]
Gentlemen of the jury, I'm curious, bear with me
Are you aware that we're making hist'ry?
This is the first murder trial of our brand-new nation
[HAMILTON]
The liberty behind
Deliberation-

[ENSEMBLE]
Non-stop!

[HAMILTON]
I intend to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt
With my assistant counsel-

[BURR]
Co-counsel
Hamilton, sit down
Our client Levi Weeks is innocent. Call your first witness
That's all you had to say!

[HAMILTON]
Okay!
One more thing-

[BURR]
Why do you assume you're the smartest in the room?
Why do you assume you're the smartest in the room?
Why do you assume you're the smartest in the room?
Soon that attitude may be your doom!

[ENSEMBLE]
Awwww!

[BURR]
Why do you write like you're running out of time?
Write day and night like you're running out of time?
Ev'ry day you fight, like you're running out of time

Keep on fighting. In the meantime- [ENSEMBLE]
Why do you write like you're running out of time?

Ev'ry day you fight, like you're running out of time

Non-stop!

[HAMILTON]
Corruption's such an old song that we can sing along in harmony
And nowhere is it stronger than in Albany
This colony's economy's increasingly stalling and

[HAMILTON]
Honestly, that's why public service
Seems to be calling me.

[BURR AND ENSEMBLE]
He's just
Non-stop!

[HAMILTON]
I practiced the law, I practic'ly perfected it
I've seen injustice in the world and I've corrected it
Now for a strong central democracy
If not, then I'll be Socrates
[HAMILTON]
Throwing verbal rocks
At these mediocrities.

[ENSEMBLE]
Awww!

[BURR]
Hamilton, at the Constitutional Convention:

[HAMILTON]
I was chosen for the Constitutional Convention

[BURR]
There as a New York junior delegate:
[HAMILTON]
Now what I'm going to say may sound indelicate...

[BURR]
Goes and proposes his own form of government!

His own plan for a new form of government!

[COMPANY]
Awwww!

What?

What?

[BURR]
Talks for six hours! The convention is listless!

[ENSEMBLE MAN]
Bright young man...

[ANOTHER ENSEMBLE MAN]
Yo, who the f is this?

[BURR]
Why do you always say what you believe?
Why do you always say what you believe?
Ev'ry proclamation guarantees free ammunition for your enemies!

[BURR AND MEN]
Why do you write like it's
Going out of style?
Write day and night like it's
Going out of style?

[COMPANY]
Why do you always say what you believe?
Awww!

[ALL WOMEN]
Going out of style, hey!
Going out of style, hey!

[BURR AND COMPANY]
Ev'ry day you fight like it's
Going out of style
Do what you do

[BURR]
Alexander?

[HAMILTON]
Aaron Burr, sir

[BURR]
It's the middle of the night

[HAMILTON]
Can we confer, sir?

[BURR]
Is this a legal matter?

HAMILTON
Yes, and it's important to me

[BURR]
What do you need?

[HAMILTON]
Burr, you're a better lawyer than me

[BURR]
Okay

[HAMILTON]
I know I talk too much, I'm abrasive
You're incredible in court. You're succinct, persuasive
My client needs a strong defense. You're the solution

[BURR]
Who's your client?

[HAMILTON]
The new U.S. Constitution?

[BURR]
No

[HAMILTON]
Hear me out

[BURR]
No way!

[HAMILTON]
A series of essays, anonymously published
Defending the document to the public

[BURR]
No one will read it

[HAMILTON]
I disagree

[BURR]
And if it fails?

[HAMILTON]
Burr, that's why we need it

[BURR]
The constitution's a mess

[HAMILTON]
So it needs amendments

[BURR]
It's full of contradictions

[HAMILTON]
So is independence
We have to start somewhere

[BURR]
No. No way

[HAMILTON]
You're making a mistake

[BURR]
Good night

[HAMILTON]
Hey
What are you waiting for?
What do you stall for?

[BURR]
What?

[HAMILTON]
We won the war
What was it all for?
Do you support this constitution?

[BURR]
Of course

[HAMILTON]
Then defend it

[BURR]
And what if you're backing the wrong horse?

[HAMILTON]
Burr, we studied and we fought and we killed
For the notion of a nation we now get to build
For once in your life, take a stand with pride
I don't understand how you stand to the side

[BURR]
I'll keep all my plans
Close to my chest

I'll wait here and see
Which way the wind
Will blow
I'm taking my time
Watching the
Afterbirth of a nation
Watching the tension grow.

[ENSEMBLE]
Wait for it, wait for
It, wait...

Which way the wind
Will blow
I'm taking my time
Watching the
Afterbirth of a nation
Watching the tension grow.

[ANGELICA]
I am sailing off to London. I'm accompanied by someone
Who always pays
I have found a wealthy husband who will keep
Me in comfort for all my days
He is not a lot of fun, but there's no one who
Can match you for turn of phrase
My Alexander

[HAMILTON]
Angelica

[ANGELICA]
Don't forget to write

[ELIZA]
Look at where you are
Look at where you started
The fact that you're alive is a miracle
Just stay alive, that would be enough
And if your wife could share a fraction of your time
If I could grant you peace of mind
Would that be enough?

[BURR]
Alexander joins forces with James Madison and John Jay to write a series of essays defending the new United States Constitution, entitled The Federalist Papers. The plan was to write a total of twenty-five essays, the work divided evenly among the three men. In the end, they wrote eighty-five essays, in the span of six months. John Jay got sick after writing five. James Madison wrote twenty-nine. Hamilton wrote the other fifty-one!

[BURR]
How do you write like you're
Running out of time?
Write day and night like you're
Running out of time?

[BURR AND MEN]
Ev'ry day you fight
Like you're
Running out of time
Like you're
Running out of time
Are you
Running out of time?
[ALL WOMEN]
Running out of time?
Running out of time?
Running out of time
Running out of time
Awwww!

[FULL COMPANY (EXCEPT HAMILTON)]
How do you write like tomorrow won't arrive?
How do you write like you need it to survive?
How do you write ev'ry second you're alive?
Ev'ry second you're alive? Ev'ry second you're alive?

[WASHINGTON]
They are asking me to lead
I am doing the best I can
To get the people that I need
I'm asking you to be my right hand man

[HAMILTON]
Treasury or State?

[WASHINGTON]
I know it's a lot to ask

[HAMILTON]
Treasury or State?

[WASHINGTON]
To leave behind the world you know...

[HAMILTON]
Sir, do you want me to run the Treasury or State department?

[WASHINGTON]

[HAMILTON]
Let's go

[HAMILTON]

How does a bastard, orphan, son of a whore and a
Scotsman, dropped in the middle of a
Forgotten spot in the Caribbean by providence
Impoverished, in squalor
Grow up to be a hero and a scholar?

[LAURENS]
The ten-dollar founding father without a father
Got a lot farther by working a lot harder
By being a lot smarter
By being a self-starter
By fourteen, they placed him in charge of a
Trading charter

[JEFFERSON]
And every day while slaves were being slaughtered and carted
Away across the waves, he struggled and kept his guard up
Inside, he was longing for something to be a part of
The brother was ready to beg, steal, borrow, or barter

[MADISON]
Then a hurricane came, and devastation reigned
Our man saw his future drip, dripping down the drain
Put a pencil to his temple, connected it to his brain
And he wrote his first refrain, a testament to his pain

[BURR]
Well, the word got around, they said, "This kid is insane, man"
Took up a collection just to send him to the mainland
"Get your education, don't forget from whence you came, and
The world is gonna know your name. What's your name, man?"

[HAMILTON]
Alexander Hamilton
My name is Alexander Hamilton
And there's a million things I haven't done
But just you wait, just you wait...

[ELIZA]
When he was ten his father split, full of it, debt-ridden
Two years later, see Alex and his mother bed-ridden
Half-dead sittin in their own sick, the scent thick

[COMPANY]
And Alex got better but his mother went quick

[WASHINGTON]
Moved in with a cousin, the cousin committed suicide
Left him with nothin' but ruined pride, something new inside
A voice saying
[WASHINGTON]
"You gotta fend for yourself." [COMPANY]
"Alex, you gotta fend for yourself."

[WASHINGTON]
He started retreatin' and readin' every treatise on the shelf
[BURR]
There would have been nothin' left to do
For someone less astute
He woulda been dead or destitute
Without a cent of restitution
Started workin', clerkin' for his late mother's landlord
Tradin' sugar cane and rum and all the things he can't afford
Scammin' for every book he can get his hands on
Plannin' for the future see him now as he stands on
The bow of a ship headed for a new land
In New York you can be a new man

[COMPANY]
In New York you can
Be a new man-
In New York you can
Be a new man-

You never learned to take your time!

Oh, Alexander Hamilton

When America sings for you
Will they know what you overcame?
Will they know you rewrote the game?
The world will never be the same, oh

The ship is in the harbor now
See if you can spot him

Comin' up from the bottom

His enemies destroyed his rep
America forgot him

Aaron Burr, Sir

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[COMPANY]
1776. New York City

[HAMILTON]
Pardon me. Are you Aaron Burr, sir?

[BURR]
That depends. Who's asking?

[HAMILTON]
Oh, well, sure, sir
I'm Alexander Hamilton, I'm at your service, sir
I have been looking for you

[BURR]
I'm getting nervous

[HAMILTON]
Sir...
I heard your name at Princeton. I was seeking an accelerated course of study when I got sort of out of sorts with a buddy of yours. I may have punched him. It's a blur, sir. He handles the financials?

[BURR]
You punched the bursar

[HAMILTON]
Yes!
I wanted to do what you did. Graduate in two, then join the revolution. He looked at me like I was stupid, I'm not stupid

So how'd you do it? How'd you graduate so fast?

[BURR]
It was my parents' dying wish before they passed

[HAMILTON]
You're an orphan. Of course! I'm an orphan
God, I wish there was a war!
Then we could prove that we're worth more
Than anyone bargained for...

[BURR]
Can I buy you a drink?

[HAMILTON]
That would be nice

[BURR]
While we're talking, let me offer you some free advice
Talk less

[HAMILTON]
What?

[BURR]
Smile more

[HAMILTON]
Ha

[BURR]
Don't let them know what you're against or what you're for

[HAMILTON]
You can't be serious

[BURR]
You wanna get ahead?

[HAMILTON]
Yes

[BURR]
Fools who run their mouths off wind up dead

[LAURENS]
Yo yo yo yo yo!
What time is it?

[LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
Show time!

[BURR]
...like I said...

[LAURENS]
Show time! Show time! Yo!
I'm John Laurens in the place to be!
Two pints o' Sam Adams, but I'm workin' on three, uh!
Those redcoats don't want it with me!
Cuz I will pop chick-a pop these cops till I'm free!

[LAFAYETTE]
Oui oui, mon ami, je m'appelle Lafayette!
The Lancelot of the revolutionary set!
I came from afar just to say "Bonsoir!"
Tell the King "Casse toi!" Who's the best?
C'est moi!

[MULLIGAN]
Brrrah brraaah! I am Hercules Mulligan
Up in it, lovin' it, yes I heard ya mother said "Come again?"
Lock up ya daughters and horses, of course
It's hard to have intercourse over four sets of corsets...

[LAURENS]
No more sex, pour me another brew, son!
Let's raise a couple more...

[LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
To the revolution!

[LAURENS]
Well, if it ain't the prodigy of Princeton college!

[MULLIGAN]
Aaron Burr!

[LAURENS]
Give us a verse, drop some knowledge!

[BURR]
Good luck with that: you're takin' a stand
You spit. I'm ‘a sit. We'll see where we land

[LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
Boooo!

[LAURENS]
Burr, the revolution's imminent. What do you stall for?

[HAMILTON]
If you stand for nothing, Burr, what'll you fall for?
[LAURENS]
Ooh
Who are you? [MULLIGAN]

My Shot

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[HAMILTON]
I am not throwing away my shot!
I am not throwing away my shot!
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot!
I'm ‘a get a scholarship to King's College
I prob'ly shouldn't brag, but dag, I amaze and astonish
The problem is I got a lot of brains but no polish
I gotta holler just to be heard
With every word, I drop knowledge!
I'm a diamond in the rough, a shiny piece of coal
Tryin' to reach my goal. My power of speech: unimpeachable
Only nineteen but my mind is older
These New York City streets get colder, I shoulder
Ev'ry burden, ev'ry disadvantage
I have learned to manage, I don't have a gun to brandish
I walk these streets famished
The plan is to fan this spark into a flame
But damn, it's getting dark, so let me spell out the name
I am the-

[HAMILTON/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN/LAURENS]
A-L-E-X-A-N-D
E-R-we are-meant to be...

[HAMILTON]
A colony that runs independently
Meanwhile, Britain keeps shittin' on us endlessly
Essentially, they tax us relentlessly
Then King George turns around, runs a spending spree
He ain't ever gonna set his descendants free
So there will be a revolution in this century
Enter me!

[LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN/LAURENS]
(He says in parentheses)

[HAMILTON]
Don't be shocked when your hist'ry book mentions me
I will lay down my life if it sets us free
Eventually, you'll see my ascendancy
[HAMILTON]
And I am not throwing away
My shot
I am not throwing away
My shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot
[LAURENS]
My shot!

My shot!

And I'm not throwing away my shot.

[HAMILTON/MULLIGAN/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE]
I am not throwing away my shot
I am not throwing away my shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot
It's time to take a shot!

[LAFAYETTE]
I dream of life without a monarchy
The unrest in France will lead to ‘onarchy?
‘Onarchy? How you say, how you say, ‘anarchy?'
When I fight, I make the other side panicky
With my-

[HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
Shot!

[MULLIGAN]
Yo, I'm a tailor's apprentice
And I got y'all knuckleheads in loco parentis
I'm joining the rebellion cuz I know it's my chance
To socially advance, instead of sewin' some pants!
I'm gonna take a-

[HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
Shot!

[LAURENS]
But we'll never be truly free
Until those in bondage have the same rights as you and me
You and I. Do or die. Wait till I sally in
On a stallion with the first black battalion
Have another-

[HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
Shot!

[BURR]
Geniuses, lower your voices
You keep out of trouble and you double your choices
I'm with you, but the situation is fraught
You've got to be carefully taught:
If you talk, you're gonna get shot!

[HAMILTON]
Burr, check what we got
Mister Lafayette, hard rock like Lancelot
I think your pants look hot
Laurens, I like you a lot
Let's hatch a plot blacker than the kettle callin' the pot...
What are the odds the gods would put us all in one spot
Poppin' a squat on conventional wisdom, like it or not
A bunch of revolutionary manumission abolitionists?
Give me a position, show me where the ammunition is!

Oh, am I talkin' too loud?
Sometimes I get over excited, shoot off at the mouth
I never had a group of friends before
I promise that I'll make y'all proud

[LAURENS]
Let's get this guy in front of a crowd

[HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN/ENSEMBLE]
I am not throwing away my shot
I am not throwing away my shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot

I am not throwing away my shot
I am not throwing away my shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot
[LAURENS]
Ev'rybody sing:
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Hey!
Whoa!
Wooh!!
Whoa!
Ay, let ‘em hear ya!

Let's go!

I said shout it to the rooftops!

[HAMILTON]
I imagine death so much it feels more like a memory
When's it gonna get me?
In my sleep? Seven feet ahead of me?
If I see it comin', do I run or do I let it be?
Is it like a beat without a melody?
See, I never thought I'd live past twenty
Where I come from some get half as many
Ask anybody why we livin' fast and we laugh, reach for a flask
We have to make this moment last, that's plenty

Scratch that
This is not a moment, it's the movement
Where all the hungriest brothers with
Something to prove went?
Foes oppose us, we take an honest stand
We roll like Moses, claimin' our promised land
And? If we win our independence?
‘Zat a guarantee of freedom for our descendants?
Or will the blood we shed begin an endless
Cycle of vengeance and death with no defendants?
I know the action in the street is excitin'
But Jesus, between all the bleedin' ‘n fightin'
I've been readin' ‘n writin'
We need to handle our financial situation
Are we a nation of states? What's the state of our nation?
I'm past patiently waitin'. I'm passionately
Smashin' every expectation
Every action's an act of creation!
I'm laughin' in the face of casualties and sorrow
For the first time, I'm thinkin' past tomorrow

[HAMILTON AND COMPANY]

There's nothing rich folks love more

They pull up in their carriages and gawk

His daughters, Peggy, Angelica, Eliza

Farmer Refuted

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[SEABURY]
Hear ye, hear ye! My name is Samuel Seabury
And I present "Free Thoughts on the
Proceedings of the Continental Congress!"
Heed not the rabble who scream revolution
They have not your interests at heart

[MULLIGAN]
Oh my God. Tear this dude apart

[SEABURY]
Chaos and bloodshed are not a solution
Don't let them lead you astray
This Congress does not speak for me

[BURR]
Let him be

[SEABURY]
They're playing a dangerous game
I pray the king shows you his mercy
For shame, for shame...
[HAMILTON]
Yo!
He'd have you all unravel at the
Sound of screams but the
Revolution is comin'
The have-nots are gonna
Win this
It's hard to listen to you with a straight face

Chaos and bloodshed already haunt us, honestly you shouldn't even talk. And what about Boston? Look at the cost, n' all that we've lost n' you talk
About Congress?!

My dog speaks more eloquently than thee!

But strangely, your mange is the same

Is he in Jersey?

For the revolution!
[SEABURY]
Heed not the rabble
Who scream
Revolution, they
Have not your
Interests
At heart

Chaos and bloodshed are
Not a
Solution. Don't
Let them lead you
Astray
This Congress does not
Speak for me

They're playing a dangerous game

I pray the king shows you his mercy

For shame

For shame,

[COMPANY]
For the revolution!

[SEABURY]
Heed-

[HAMILTON]
If you repeat yourself again I'm gonna-

[SEABURY/HAMILTON]
Scream-

[HAMILTON]
Honestly, look at me, please don't read!

[SEABURY]
Not your interests-

[HAMILTON]
Don't modulate the key then not debate with me!
Why should a tiny island across the sea regulate the price of tea?

[BURR]
Alexander, please!

Burr, I'd rather be divisive than indecisive, drop the niceties

You'll Be Back

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[KING GEORGE]
You say
The price of my love's not a price that you're willing to pay
You cry
In your tea which you hurl in the sea when you see me go by
Why so sad?
Remember we made an arrangement when you went away
Now you're making me mad
Remember, despite our estrangement, I'm your man
You'll be back
Soon you'll see
You'll remember you belong to me
You'll be back
Time will tell
You'll remember that I served you well
Oceans rise
Empires fall
We have seen each other through it all
And when push
Comes to shove
I will send a fully armed battalion
To remind you of my love!

Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da
Da da dat dat da ya da!
Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da
Da da dat dat da...

You say our love is draining and you can't go on
You'll be the one complaining when I am gone...
And no, don't change the subject
Cuz you're my favorite subject
My sweet, submissive subject
My loyal, royal subject
Forever and ever and ever and ever and ever...

You'll be back
Like before
I will fight the fight and win the war
For your love
For your praise
And I'll love you till my dying days
When you're gone
I'll go mad
So don't throw away this thing we had

Cuz when push comes to shove
I will kill your friends and family to remind you of my love
Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da
Da da dat dat da ya da!
Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da
Da da dat-
Everybody!

[ENSEMBLE]
Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da

Check it-
Can I be real a second?
For just a millisecond?
Let down my guard and tell the people how I feel a second?
Now I'm the model of a modern major general
The venerated Virginian veteran whose men are all
Lining up, to put me up on a pedestal
Writin' letters to relatives
Embellishin' my elegance and eloquence
But the elephant is in the room
The truth is in ya face when ya hear the British cannons go...

[ENSEMBLE]
Boom!

[WASHINGTON]
Any hope of success is fleeting
How can I keep leading when the people I'm
Leading keep retreating?
We put a stop to the bleeding as the British take Brooklyn
Knight takes rook, but look

Outmanned

[WASHINGTON]
We gotta run to Harlem quick, we can't afford another slip
Guns and horses giddyup
I decide to divvy up
My forces, they're skittish as the British cut the city up
This close to giving up, facing mad scrutiny
I scream in the face of this mass mutiny:
Are these the men with which I am to defend America?
We ride at midnight, Manhattan in the distance
I cannot be everywhere at once, people
I'm in dire need of assistance...

[BURR]
Your excellency, sir!

[WASHINGTON]
Who are you?

[BURR]
Aaron Burr, Sir?
Permission to state my case?

[WASHINGTON]
As you were

[BURR]
Sir
I was a captain under General Montgomery
Until he caught a bullet in the neck in Quebec
And well, in summary
I think that I could be of some assistance
I admire how you keep firing on the British
From a distance

[WASHINGTON]
Huh

[BURR]
I have some questions, a couple of suggestions on how to fight instead of fleeing west

[WASHINGTON]
Yes?

[BURR]
Well-

Your excellency, you wanted to see me?

Sir?

Close the door on your way out

[HAMILTON]
Have I done something wrong, sir?

[WASHINGTON]
On the contrary
I called you here because our odds are beyond scary
Your reputation precedes you, but I have to laugh

[HAMILTON]
Sir?

[WASHINGTON]
Hamilton, how come no one can get you on their staff?

[HAMILTON]
Sir!

[WASHINGTON]
Don't get me wrong, you're a young man, of great renown
I know you stole British cannons when we were still downtown
Nathaniel Green and Henry Knox wanted to hire you...

[HAMILTON]
To be their Secretary? I don't think so

[WASHINGTON]
Why're you upset?

[HAMILTON]
I'm not-

[WASHINGTON]
It's alright, you want to fight, you've got a hunger
I was just like you when I was younger
Head full of fantasies of dyin' like a martyr?

[HAMILTON]
Yes

[WASHINGTON]
Dying is easy, young man. Living is harder

[HAMILTON]
Why are you telling me this?

[WASHINGTON]
I'm being honest
I'm working with a third of what our Congress has promised
We are a powder keg about to explode
I need someone like you to lighten the load. So?

[COMPANY (EXCEPT HAMILTON)]
I am not throwin' away my shot!
I am not throwin' away my shot!

[WASHINGTON AND COMPANY]
Outnumbered, outplanned!

We'll need some spies on the inside
Some King's men who might let some things slide

I'll write to Congress and tell ‘em we need supplies, you rally the guys, master the element of surprise

I'll rise above my station, organize your information, ‘til we rise to the occasion of our new nation. Sir!

A Winter's Ball

How does the bastard, orphan, son of a whore
Go on and on
Grow into more of a phenomenon?
Watch this obnoxious, arrogant, loudmouth bother
Be seated at the right hand of the father
Washington hires Hamilton right on sight
But Hamilton still wants to fight, not write
Now Hamilton's skill with a quill is undeniable
But what do we have in common? We're
Reliable with the

Ohh, I do I do I do I
Dooo! Hey!
Ohh, I do I do I do I
Dooo! Boy you got me [ALL WOMEN]
Hey hey hey hey
Hey hey hey hey
Hey hey hey hey
Hey hey hey

[ELIZA AND WOMEN]
Helpless!
Look into your eyes, and the sky's the limit I'm helpless!
Down for the count, and I'm drownin' in ‘em

[ELIZA]
I have never been the type to try and grab the spotlight
We were at a revel with some rebels on a hot night
Laughin' at my sister as she's dazzling the room
Then you walked in and my heart went "Boom!"
Tryin' to catch your eye from the side of the ballroom
Everybody's dancin' and the band's top volume

[ELIZA AND WOMEN]
Grind to the rhythm as we wine and dine
[ELIZA]
Grab my sister, and
Whisper, "Yo, this
One's mine."

My sister made her way across the room to you
And I got nervous, thinking "What's she gonna do?"
She grabbed you by the arm, I'm thinkin' "I'm through"
Then you look back at me and suddenly I'm
Helpless!

Oh, look at those eyes

Oh!
Yeah, I'm
Helpless, I know

I'm so into you
I am so into you

I know I'm down for the count
And I'm drownin' in ‘em.

[ALL WOMEN]
Oooh

Oooh

Oooh

Oooh

Helpless!

Look into your eyes
And the sky's the limit
I'm
Helpless!
Down for the count
And I'm drownin' in ‘em

I'm helpless!

Look into your eyes
And the sky's the limit I'm helpless!

Down for the count
And I'm drownin' in ‘em.

[HAMILTON]
Where are you taking me?

[ANGELICA]
I'm about to change your life

[HAMILTON]
Then by all means, lead the way

[ELIZA]
Elizabeth Schuyler. It's a pleasure to meet you

[HAMILTON]
Schuyler?

[ANGELICA]
My sister

[ELIZA]
Thank you for all your service

[HAMILTON]
If it takes fighting a war for us to meet, it will have been worth it

[ANGELICA]
I'll leave you to it

[ELIZA AND WOMEN]
One week later

[ELIZA]
I'm writin' a letter nightly
Now my life gets better, every letter that you write me
Laughin' at my sister, cuz she wants to form a harem

[ANGELICA]
I'm just sayin', if you really loved me, you would share him
[ELIZA]
Ha!
Two weeks later
In the living room stressin'
My father's stone-faced
While you're asking for his blessin'
I'm dying inside, as
You wine
And dine
And I'm tryin' not to cry
‘cause there's nothing that your mind can't do
My father makes his way across the room
To you
I panic for a second, thinking
"we're through"
But then he shakes your hand and says
"Be true"
And you turn back to me, smiling, and I'm
Helpless!

Helpless!
Hoo!

That boy is mine
That boy is mine!

Helpless! Helpless!
Down for the count
And I'm drownin' in em

[ALL WOMEN]
Stressin'

Blessin'

Oooh

Oooh

Oooh

Oooh

Helpless!
Look into your eyes
And the sky's the
Limit I'm
Helpless!
Down for the count
And I'm drownin' in
‘em I'm
Helpless!

Look into your eyes
And the sky's the
Limit I'm
Helpless!
Down for the count
And I'm drownin' in em

[HAMILTON]
Eliza, I don't have a dollar to my name
An acre of land, a troop to command, a dollop of fame
All I have's my honor, a tolerance for pain
A couple of college credits and my top-notch brain
Insane, your family brings out a different side of me
Peggy confides in me, Angelica tried to take a bite of me
No stress, my love for you is never in doubt
We'll get a little place in Harlem and we'll figure it out
I've been livin' without a family since I was a child
My father left, my mother died, I grew up buckwild
But I'll never forget my mother's face, that was real
And long as I'm alive, Eliza, swear to God
You'll never feel so...

[HAMILTON]
Eliza...

I've never felt so-

My life is gon' be fine cuz Eliza's in it.
[ELIZA]
I do I do I do I do!

I do I do I do I do!

Hey, yeah, yeah!

I'm down for the count
I'm-

I look into your eyes, and the sky's the limit
I'm

...drownin' in ‘em. [ALL WOMEN]
Helpless!

Helpless!

Helpless!

Down for the count
And I'm drownin' in ‘em

Helpless!

Helpless!

Helpless!

Down for the count
And I'm drownin' in ‘em.

Satisfied

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[LAURENS]
Alright, alright. That's what I'm talkin' about!
Now everyone give it up for the maid of honor
Angelica Schuyler!
[ANGELICA]
A toast to the groom!

To the bride!

From your sister

Who is always by your side

To your union

And the hope that you provide

May you always...

Be satisfied.

[ALL MEN]
To the groom!
To the groom!
To the groom!

To the bride!
To the bride!

Angelica!
Angelica!
Angelica!

By your side!

To the union!
To the revolution!

You provide!
You provide!

[HAMILTON AND MEN]
Always-

Rewind-

[ALL WOMEN]
To the groom!

To the bride!

To the bride!

[ELIZA AND WOMEN]
Angelica!

By your side!

To the union!
To the revolution!

You provide!

Always-

Rewind-

[ANGELICA]
I remember that night, I just might
Regret that night for the rest of my days

I remember those soldier boys
Tripping over themselves to win our praise

I remember that dreamlike candlelight
Like a dream that you can't quite place

But Alexander, I'll never forget the first
Time I saw your face

I have never been the same
Intelligent eyes in a hunger-pang frame
And when you said "Hi," I forgot my dang name
Set my heart aflame, ev'ry part aflame

[FULL COMPANY]
This is not a game...

[HAMILTON]
You strike me as a woman who has never been satisfied

[ANGELICA]
I'm sure I don't know what you mean. You forget yourself

[HAMILTON]
You're like me. I'm never satisfied

[ANGELICA]
Is that right?

[HAMILTON]
I have never been satisfied

[ANGELICA]
My name is Angelica Schuyler

[HAMILTON]
Alexander Hamilton

[ANGELICA]
Where's your fam'ly from?

[HAMILTON]
Unimportant. There's a million things I haven't done but
Just you wait, just you wait...

[ANGELICA]
So so so-
So this is what it feels like to match wits
With someone at your level! What the hell is the catch? It's
The feeling of freedom, of seein' the light
It's Ben Franklin with a key and a kite! You see it, right?
The conversation lasted two minutes, maybe three minutes
Ev'rything we said in total agreement, it's
A dream and it's a bit of a dance
A bit of a posture, it's a bit of a stance. He's a
Bit of a flirt, but I'm ‘a give it a chance
I asked about his fam'ly, did you see his answer?
His hands started fidgeting, he looked askance?
He's penniless, he's flying by the seat of his pants

Handsome, boy, does he know it!
Peach fuzz, and he can't even grow it!
I wanna take him far away from this place
Then I turn and see my sister's face and she is...

[ELIZA]
Helpless...

[ANGELICA]
And I know she is...

[ELIZA]
Helpless...

[ANGELICA]
And her eyes are just...

[ELIZA]
Helpless...

[ANGELICA]
And I realize

[ANGELICA AND COMPANY]
Three fundamental truths at the exact same time...

[HAMILTON]
Where are you taking me?

[ANGELICA]
I'm about to change your life

[HAMILTON]
Then by all means, lead the way

[COMPANY (EXCEPT ANGELICA)]
Number one!

[ANGELICA]
I'm a girl in a world in which
My only job is to marry rich
My father has no sons so I'm the one
Who has to social climb for one
So I'm the oldest and the wittiest and the gossip in
New York City is insidious
Alexander is penniless
Ha! That doesn't mean I want him any less

[ELIZA]
Elizabeth Schuyler. It's a pleasure to meet you

[HAMILTON]
Schuyler?

[ANGELICA]
My sister

[COMPANY]
Number two!

[ANGELICA]
He's after me cuz I'm a Schuyler sister
That elevates his status, I'd
Have to be naïve to set that aside
Maybe that is why I introduce him to Eliza
Now that's his bride
Nice going, Angelica, he was right
You will never be satisfied

[ELIZA]
Thank you for all your service

[HAMILTON]
If it takes fighting a war for us to meet, it will have been worth it

[ANGELICA]
I'll leave you to it

[COMPANY]
Number three!

[ANGELICA]
I know my sister like I know my own mind
You will never find anyone as trusting or as kind
If I tell her that I love him she'd be silently resigned
He'd be mine
She would say, "I'm fine"

[ANGELICA AND COMPANY]
She'd be lying

[ANGELICA]
But when I fantasize at night
It's Alexander's eyes
As I romanticize what might
Have been if I hadn't sized him
Up so quickly
At least my dear Eliza's his wife;
At least I keep his eyes in my life...
[ANGELICA]
To the groom!

To the bride!

From your sister

Who is always by your side

To your union

And the hope that you provide

May you always

Be satisfied

And I know

She'll be happy as

His bride
And I know [ALL MEN (EXCEPT HAMILTON)]
To the groom!
To the groom!
To the groom!

To the bride!
To the bride!

Angelica!
Angelica!

By your side

To the union!
To the revolution!

You provide!
You provide!

[HAMILTON AND MEN]
Always-

Be satisfied

Be satisfied

[MEN]
Be satisfied
Be satisfied
Be satisfied
Be satisfied

Be satisfied
Be satisfied

Be satisfied
Be satisfied
Be satisfied
Be satisfied.

[ALL WOMEN (EXCEPT ELIZA)]
To the groom!

To the bride!

To the bride!

[ELIZA AND WOMEN]
Angelica!

By your side

To the union!

Be satisfied

The Story of Tonight (Reprise)

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[LAURENS]
I may not live to see our glory!

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE]
I may not live to see our glory!

[LAURENS]
But I've seen wonders great and small

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE]
I've seen wonders great and small

[LAURENS]
‘Cause if the tomcat can get married

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE]
If Alexander can get married-

[LAURENS]
There's hope for our ass, after all!

[LAFAYETTE]
Raise a glass to freedom

[LAURENS/MULLIGAN]
Hey!
Something you will never see again!

[MULLIGAN]
No matter what she tells you

[LAFAYETTE]
Let's have another round tonight!

[LAURENS]
Raise a glass to the four of us!

[LAFAYETTE/HAMILTON]
Ho!

[MULLIGAN]
To the newly not poor of us!

[LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/HAMILTON]
Woo!

[LAFAYETTE]
We'll tell the story of tonight

[LAURENS]
Let's have another round-

[HAMILTON]
Well, if it isn't Aaron Burr

[BURR]
Sir!

[HAMILTON]
I didn't think that you would make it

[BURR]
To be sure

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE]
Burr!

[BURR]
I came to say congratulations

[MULLIGAN]
Spit a verse, Burr!

[BURR]
I see the whole gang is here

[LAFAYETTE]
You are the worst, Burr!

[HAMILTON]
Ignore them. Congrats to you, Lieutenant Colonel
I wish I had your command instead of manning George's journal

[BURR]
No, you don't

[HAMILTON]
Yes, I do

[BURR]
Now, be sensible
From what I hear, you've made yourself indispensable

[LAURENS]
Well, well, I heard
You've got a special someone on the side, Burr

[HAMILTON]
Is that so?

[LAURENS]
What are you tryin' to hide, Burr?

[BURR]
I should go

[HAMILTON]
No, these guys should go

[LAFAYETTE]
What?

[LAURENS]
No!

[HAMILTON]
Leave us alone

[MULLIGAN]
Man...

[HAMILTON]
It's alright, Burr. I wish you'd brought this girl with you tonight, Burr

[BURR]
You're very kind, but I'm afraid it's unlawful, sir

[HAMILTON]
What do you mean?

[BURR]
She's married

[HAMILTON]
I see

[BURR]
She's married to a British officer

[HAMILTON]
Oh shit...

[BURR]
Congrats again, Alexander. Smile more
I'll see you on the other side of the war

[HAMILTON]
I will never understand you
If you love this woman, go get her! What are you waiting for?

[BURR]
I'll see you on the other side of the war

[HAMILTON]
I'll see you on the other side of the war

Wait For It

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[BURR]
Theodosia writes me a letter everyday
I'm keeping the bed warm while her husband is away
He's on the British side in Georgia
He's trying to keep the colonies in line
But he can keep all of Georgia
Theodosia, she's mine

Love doesn't discriminate
Between the sinners
And the saints
It takes and it takes and it takes
And we keep loving anyway
We laugh and we cry
And we break
And we make our mistakes
And if there's a reason I'm by her side
When so many have tried
Then I'm willing to wait for it
I'm willing to wait for it
[BURR]
My grandfather was a fire and brimstone preacher

But there are things that the
Homilies and hymns won't teach ya

My mother was a genius

My father commanded respect

When they died they left no instructions
Just a legacy to protect

[MEN]
Preacher, preacher
Preacher

Teach ya, teach ya, teach ya

Respect, respect

[WOMEN]
Genius

[BURR/ENSEMBLE]
Death doesn't discriminate
Between the sinners
And the saints
It takes and it takes and it takes
And we keep living anyway
We rise and we fall
And we break
And we make our mistakes
And if there's a reason I'm still alive
When everyone who loves me has died
I'm willing to wait for it
I'm willing to wait for it

Wait for it

[ENSEMBLE]
Wait for it
Wait for it
Wait for it

[BURR]
I am the one thing in life I can control

[ENSEMBLE]
Wait for it

I am inimitable
I am an original

[ENSEMBLE]
Wait for it

[BURR]
I'm not falling behind or running late

[ENSEMBLE]
Wait for it
Wait for it
Wait for it

[BURR]
I'm not standing still
I am lying in wait

[ENSEMBLE]
Wait
Wait

[BURR]
Hamilton faces an endless uphill climb

[ENSEMBLE]
Climb
Climb
Climb

[BURR]
He has something to prove
He has nothing to lose

[ENSEMBLE]
Lose
Lose
Lose
Lose

[BURR]
Hamilton's pace is relentless
He wastes no time

[ENSEMBLE]
Time
Time
Time

[BURR]
What is it like in his shoes?

Hamilton doesn't hesitate
He exhibits no restraint
He takes and he takes and he takes
And he keeps winning anyway
He changes the game
He plays and he raises the stakes
And if there's a reason
He seems to thrive when so few survive, then Goddamnit-
[BURR]
I'm willing to wait for it

I'm willing to wait for it...

Life doesn't discriminate
Between the sinners and the saints
It takes and it takes and it takes

We rise
We fall

And if there's a reason I'm still alive
When so many have died
Then I'm willin' to-
[COMPANY]
I'm willing to wait for it
Wait for it
Wait for...
I'm willing to-

Life doesn't discriminate
Between the sinners and the saints
It takes and it takes and it takes
And we keep living anyway
We rise and we fall and we break
And we make our mistakes
And if there's a reason I'm still alive
When so many have died
Then I'm willin' to-

Stay Alive

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[ELIZA]
Stay alive...

[ELIZA/ANGELICA/ENSEMBLE WOMEN]
Stay alive...

[HAMILTON]
I have never seen the General so despondent
I have taken over writing all his correspondence
Congress writes, "George, attack the British forces."
I shoot back, we have resorted to eating our horses
Local merchants deny us equipment, assistance
They only take British money, so sing a song of sixpence

[WASHINGTON]
The cavalry's not coming

[HAMILTON]
Sir!

[WASHINGTON]
Alex, listen. There's only one way for us to win this
Provoke outrage, outright

[HAMILTON]
That's right

[WASHINGTON]
Don't engage, strike by night
Remain relentless ‘til their troops take flight

[HAMILTON]
Make it impossible to justify the cost of the fight

[WASHINGTON]
Outrun

[HAMILTON]
Outrun

[WASHINGTON]
Outlast

[HAMILTON]
Outlast

[WASHINGTON]
Hit ‘em quick, get out fast

[HAMILTON]
Chick-a-plao!

[WASHINGTON]
Stay alive ‘til this horror show is past
We're gonna fly a lot of flags half-mast

[HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE]
Raise a glass!

[MULLIGAN]
I go back to New York and my apprenticeship

[LAFAYETTE]
I ask for French aid, I pray that France has sent a ship

[LAURENS]
I stay at work with Hamilton
We write essays against slavery
And every day's a test of our camaraderie
And bravery

[HAMILTON]
We cut supply lines, we steal contraband
We pick and choose our battles and places to take a stand
And ev'ry day
"Sir, entrust me with a command,"
And ev'ry day

[WASHINGTON]
No

[HAMILTON]
He dismisses me out of hand
[HAMILTON]
Instead of me
He promotes
Charles Lee
Makes him second-in-command:

[LEE]
Charles Lee. [ELIZA/ANGELICA]
Stay alive...

[LEE]
I'm a General. Whee!!!!

[HAMILTON]
Yeah. He's not the choice I would have gone with

[HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE]
He shits the bed at the Battle of Monmouth

[WASHINGTON]
Ev'ryone attack!

[LEE]
Retreat!

[WASHINGTON]
Attack!

[LEE]
Retreat!

[WASHINGTON]
What are you doing, Lee? Get back on your feet!

[LEE]
But there's so many of them!

[WASHINGTON]
I'm sorry, is this not your speed?!
Hamilton!

[HAMILTON]
Ready, sir!

[WASHINGTON]
Have Lafayette take the lead!

[HAMILTON]
Yes, sir!

[LAURENS]
A thousand soldiers die in a hundred degree heat

[LAFAYETTE]
As we snatch a stalemate from the jaws of defeat

[HAMILTON]
Charles Lee was left behind
Without a pot to piss in
He started sayin' this to anybody who would listen:

[LEE]
Washington cannot be left alone to his devices
Indecisive, from crisis to crisis
The best thing he can do for the revolution
Is turn n' go back to plantin' tobacco in Mount Vernon

[COMPANY]
Oo!!

[WASHINGTON]
Don't do a thing. History will prove him wrong

[HAMILTON]
But, sir!

[WASHINGTON]
We have a war to fight, let's move along

[LAURENS]
Strong words from Lee, someone oughta hold him to it

[HAMILTON]
I can't disobey direct orders

[LAURENS]
Then I'll do it
Alexander, you're the closest friend I've got

[HAMILTON]
Laurens, do not throw away your shot

Ten Duel Commandments

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[MEN]
One, two, three, four

[FULL COMPANY]
Five, six, seven, eight, nine...

[BURR/HAMILTON/LAURENS/LEE]
It's the Ten Duel Commandments

[FULL COMPANY]
It's the Ten Duel Commandments
Number one!

[LAURENS]
The challenge: demand satisfaction
If they apologize, no need for further action

[COMPANY]
Number two!

[LAURENS]
If they don't, grab a friend, that's your second

[HAMILTON]
Your lieutenant when there's reckoning to be reckoned

[COMPANY]
Number three!

[LEE]
Have your seconds meet face to face

[BURR]
Negotiate a peace...

[HAMILTON]
Or negotiate a time and place

[BURR]
This is commonplace, ‘specially ‘tween recruits

[COMPANY]
Most disputes die, and no one shoots
Number four!

[LAURENS]
If they don't reach a peace, that's alright
Time to get some pistols and a doctor on site

[HAMILTON]
You pay him in advance, you treat him with civility

[BURR]
You have him turn around so he can have deniability

[COMPANY]
Five!

[LEE]
Duel before the sun is in the sky

[COMPANY]
Pick a place to die where it's high and dry
Number six!

[HAMILTON]
Leave a note for your next of kin
Tell ‘em where you been. Pray that hell or heaven lets you in

[COMPANY]
Seven!

[LEE]
Confess your sins. Ready for the moment of adrenaline when you finally face your opponent

[COMPANY]
Number eight!

[LAURENS/LEE/HAMILTON/BURR]
Your last chance to negotiate
Send in your seconds, see if they can set the record straight...

[BURR]
Alexander

[HAMILTON]
Aaron Burr, sir

[BURR]
Can we agree that duels are dumb and immature?

[HAMILTON]
Sure
But your man has to answer for his words, Burr

[BURR]
With his life? We both know that's absurd, sir

[HAMILTON]
Hang on, how many men died because Lee was inexperienced and ruinous?

[BURR]
Okay, so we're doin' this

[COMPANY]
Number nine!

[HAMILTON]
Look ‘em in the eye, aim no higher
Summon all the courage you require
Then count

[MEN]
One two three four

[FULL COMPANY]
Five six seven eight nine

[HAMILTON/BURR]
Number

[COMPANY]
Ten paces!

Meet Me Inside

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[HAMILTON]
Lee, do you yield?

[BURR]
You shot him in the side!
Yes, he yields!

[LAURENS]
I'm satisfied

[BURR]
Yo, we gotta clear the field!

[HAMILTON]
Go! We won

[COMPANY]
Here comes the General!

[BURR]
This should be fun

[WASHINGTON]
What is the meaning of this? Mr. Burr, get a medic for the General

[BURR]
Yes, sir

[WASHINGTON]
Lee, you will never agree with me
But believe me, these young men don't speak for me
Thank you for your service

[BURR]
Let's ride!

[WASHINGTON]
Hamilton!

[HAMILTON]
Sir!

[WASHINGTON]
Meet me inside

[COMPANY]
Meet him inside! Meet him inside!
Meet him inside, meet him, meet him inside!

[WASHINGTON]
Son-

[HAMILTON]
Don't call me son

[WASHINGTON]
This war is hard enough
Without infighting-

[HAMILTON]
Lee called you out. We called his bluff

[WASHINGTON]
You solve nothing, you aggravate our allies to the south

[HAMILTON]
You're absolutely right, John should have shot him in the mouth
That would've shut him up

[WASHINGTON]
Son-

[HAMILTON]
I'm notcha son-

[WASHINGTON]
Watch your tone
I am not a maiden in need of defending, I am grown

[HAMILTON (OVERLAPPING)]
Charles Lee, Thomas Conway
These men take your name and they rake it
Through the mud

[WASHINGTON]
My name's been through a lot, I can take it

[HAMILTON]
Well, I don't have your name. I don't have your titles
I don't have your land
But, if you-

[WASHINGTON]
No-

[HAMILTON]
If you gave me command of a battalion, a group of men to lead, I could fly above my station after the war

[WASHINGTON]
Or you could die and we need you alive

[HAMILTON]
I'm more than willing to die-

[WASHINGTON]
Your wife needs you alive, son, I need you alive-

[HAMILTON]
Call me son one more time-

[WASHINGTON]
Go home, Alexander
That's an order from your commander

[HAMILTON]
Sir-

[WASHINGTON]
Go home

That Would Be Enough

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[ELIZA]
Look around, look around at how lucky we are
To be alive right now
Look around, look around...

[HAMILTON]
How long have you known?

[ELIZA]
A month or so

[HAMILTON]
Eliza, you should have told me

[ELIZA]
I wrote to the General a month ago

[HAMILTON]
No

[ELIZA]
I begged him to send you home

[HAMILTON]
You should have told me

[ELIZA]
I'm not sorry
[ELIZA]
I knew you'd fight
Until the war was won

But you deserve a chance to meet your son
Look around, look around at how lucky we are
To be alive right now.
[HAMILTON]
The war's not
Done.

[HAMILTON]
Will you relish being a poor man's wife
Unable to provide for your life?

[ELIZA]
I relish being your wife
Look around, look around...

Look at where you are
Look at where you started
The fact that you're alive is a miracle
Just stay alive, that would be enough

And if this child
Shares a fraction of your smile
Or a fragment of your mind, look out world!
That would be enough

I don't pretend to know
The challenges you're facing
The worlds you keep erasing and creating in your mind

But I'm not afraid
I know who I married
So long as you come home at the end of the day
That would be enough

We don't need a legacy
We don't need money
If I could grant you peace of mind

If you could let me inside your heart...
Oh, let me be a part of the narrative
In the story they will write someday
Let this moment be the first chapter:
Where you decide to stay
And I could be enough
And we could be enough
That would be enough

Guns and Ships

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[BURR]
How does a ragtag volunteer army in need of a shower
Somehow defeat a global superpower?
How do we emerge victorious from the quagmire?
Leave the battlefield waving Betsy Ross' flag higher?
Yo. Turns out we have a secret weapon!
An immigrant you know and love who's unafraid to step in!
He's constantly confusin', confoundin' the British henchmen
Ev'ryone give it up for America's favorite fighting Frenchman!

[COMPANY]
Lafayette!

[LAFAYETTE]
I'm takin this horse by the reins makin'
Redcoats redder with bloodstains

[COMPANY]
Lafayette!

[LAFAYETTE]
And I'm never gonna stop until I make ‘em
Drop and burn ‘em up and scatter their remains, I'm

[COMPANY]

Enragin' em! I'm-

[LAFAYETTE]
I go to France for more funds

[COMPANY]
Lafayette!

[LAFAYETTE]
I come back with more

[LAFAYETTE AND ENSEMBLE]
Guns
And ships
And so the balance shifts

[WASHINGTON]
We rendezvous with Rochambeau, consolidate their gifts

[LAFAYETTE]
We can end this war at Yorktown, cut them off at sea, but
For this to succeed, there's someone else we need:

[WASHINGTON]
I know

[WASHINGTON AND COMPANY]
Hamilton!

[LAFAYETTE]
Sir, he knows what to do in a trench
Ingenuitive and fluent in French, ami-

[WASHINGTON AND COMPANY]
Hamilton!

[LAFAYETTE]
Sir, you're gonna have to use him eventually
What's he gonna do on the bench? I mean-

[WASHINGTON AND COMPANY]
Hamilton!

[LAFAYETTE]
No one has more resilience
Or matches my practical tactical brilliance-

[WASHINGTON AND COMPANY]
Hamilton!
[LAFAYETTE]
You wanna fight for your land back?

[WASHINGTON]
I need my right hand man back!

[LAFAYETTE]
Ah! Uh, get ya right hand man back
You know you gotta get ya right hand man back

I mean you gotta put some thought into the letter but the sooner the better
To get your right hand man back!

[COMPANY]

Hamilton, Hamilton!

[WASHINGTON]
Alexander Hamilton
Troops are waiting in the field for you
If you join us right now, together we can turn the tide
Oh, Alexander Hamilton
I have soldiers who will yield for you
If we manage to get this right
They'll surrender by early light
The world will never be the same, Alexander...

History Has Its Eyes On You

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[WASHINGTON]
I was younger than you are now
When I was given my first command
I led my men straight into a massacre
I witnessed their deaths firsthand
I made every mistake
I felt the shame rise in me
And even now I lie awake
[WASHINGTON]
Knowing history has its eyes on me

[HAMILTON/WASHINGTON]
History has its eyes on me. [LAURENS/MULLIGAN]
Whoa...
Whoa...
Whoa...
Yeah

[COMPANY]
Whoa...
Whoa...
Whoa...
Yeah

[WASHINGTON]
Let me tell you what I wish I'd known
When I was young and dreamed of glory:
You have no control:

[WASHINGTON AND COMPANY]
Who lives, who dies, who tells your story

[WASHINGTON]
I know that we can win
I know that greatness lies in you
But remember from here on in
[WASHINGTON/HAMILTON AND MEN]
History has its
Eyes on you.

[ENSEMBLE]
Whoa...

Yorktown (The World Turned Upside Down)

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[COMPANY]
The battle of Yorktown. 1781

[LAFAYETTE]
Monsieur Hamilton

[HAMILTON]
Monsieur Lafayette

[LAFAYETTE]
In command where you belong

[HAMILTON]
How you say, no sweat
We're finally on the field. We've had quite a run

[LAFAYETTE]
Immigrants:

[HAMILTON/LAFAYETTE]
We get the job done

[HAMILTON]
So what happens if we win?

[LAFAYETTE]
I go back to France
I bring freedom to my people if I'm given the chance

[HAMILTON]
We'll be with you when you do

[LAFAYETTE]
Go lead your men

[HAMILTON]
See you on the other side

[LAFAYETTE]
‘Til we meet again, let's go!

[ENSEMBLE]
I am not throwin' away my shot!
I am not throwin' away my shot!
Hey yo, I'm just like my country, I'm young
Scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwin' away my shot!
I am not throwin' away my shot!

[HAMILTON]
‘Til the world turns upside down...

[ENSEMBLE]
‘Til the world turns upside down!

[HAMILTON]
I imagine death so much it feels more like a memory
This is where it gets me: on my feet
The enemy ahead of me
If this is the end of me, at least I have a friend with me
Weapon in my hand, a command, and my men with me
Then I remember my Eliza's expecting me...
Not only that, my Eliza's expecting
We gotta go, gotta get the job done
Gotta start a new nation, gotta meet my son!
Take the bullets out your gun!

[ENSEMBLE]
What?

[HAMILTON]
The bullets out your gun!

[ENSEMBLE]
What?

[HAMILTON]
We move under cover and we move as one
Through the night, we have one shot to live another day
We cannot let a stray gunshot give us away
We will fight up close, seize the moment and stay in it
It's either that or meet the business end of a bayonet
The code word is ‘Rochambeau,' dig me?

[ENSEMBLE]
Rochambeau!

[HAMILTON]
You have your orders now, go, man, go!
And so the American experiment begins
With my friends all scattered to the winds
Laurens is in South Carolina, redefining brav'ry

[HAMILTON/LAURENS]
We'll never be free until we end slavery!

[HAMILTON]
When we finally drive the British away
Lafayette is there waiting-

[HAMILTON/LAFAYETTE]
In Chesapeake Bay!

[HAMILTON]
How did we know that this plan would work?
We had a spy on the inside. That's right

[HAMILTON/COMPANY]
Hercules Mulligan!

[MULLIGAN]
A tailor spyin' on the British government!
I take their measurements, information and then I smuggle it

[COMPANY]
Up

[MULLIGAN]
To my brother's revolutionary covenant
I'm runnin' with the Sons of Liberty and I am lovin' it!
See, that's what happens when you up against the ruffians
We in the shit now, somebody gotta shovel it!
Hercules Mulligan, I need no introduction
When you knock me down I get the fuck back up again!

[COMPANY]
Left! Right! Hold!
Go!
What! What! What!

[HAMILTON]
After a week of fighting, a young man in a red coat stands on a parapet

[LAFAYETTE]
We lower our guns as he frantically waves a white handkerchief

[MULLIGAN]
And just like that, it's over. We tend to our wounded, we count our dead

[LAURENS]
Black and white soldiers wonder alike if this really means freedom

[WASHINGTON]
Not. Yet

[HAMILTON]
We negotiate the terms of surrender
I see George Washington smile
We escort their men out of Yorktown
They stagger home single file
Tens of thousands of people flood the streets
There are screams and church bells ringing
And as our fallen foes retreat
I hear the drinking song they're singing...

[ALL MEN]
The world turned upside down

[FULL COMPANY]
The world turned upside down
The world turned upside down
The world turned upside down
Down
Down, down, down

[LAFAYETTE]
Freedom for America, freedom for France!

[COMPANY]
Down, down, down

[HAMILTON]
Gotta start a new nation
Gotta meet my son

[COMPANY]
Down, down, down

[MULLIGAN]
We won!

[LAFAYETTE]
We won!

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE/LAURENS]
We won!

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE/LAURENS/HAMILTON/WASHINGTON]
We won!

[COMPANY]
The world turned upside down!

What Comes Next

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[KING GEORGE]
They say
The price of my war's not a price that they're willing to pay
Insane
You cheat with the French, now I'm fighting with France and with Spain
I'm so blue
I thought that we'd made an arrangement
When you went away
You were mine to subdue
Well, even despite our estrangement, I've got
A small query for you:

What comes next?
You've been freed
Do you know how hard it is to lead?

You're on your own
Awesome. Wow
Do you have a clue what happens now?

Oceans rise
Empires fall
It's much harder when it's all your call

All alone, across the sea
When your people say they hate you, don't
Come crawling back to me

Da da da dat da dat da da da
Da ya da
Da da dat
Da da ya da...

You're on your own...

Dear Theodosia

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[BURR]
Dear Theodosia, what to say to you?
You have my eyes. You have your mother's name

When you came into the world, you cried and it broke my heart

I'm dedicating every day to you
Domestic life was never quite my style
When you smile, you knock me out, I fall apart
And I thought I was so smart

You will come of age with our young nation
We'll bleed and fight for you, we'll make it right for you
If we lay a strong enough foundation
We'll pass it on to you, we'll give the world to you
And you'll blow us all away...
Someday, someday
Yeah, you'll blow us all away
Someday, someday

[HAMILTON]
Oh Philip, when you smile I am undone
My son
Look at my son. Pride is not the word I'm looking for

There is so much more inside me now
Oh Philip, you outshine the morning sun
My son
When you smile, I fall apart
And I thought I was so smart
My father wasn't around

[BURR]
My father wasn't around
[HAMILTON]
I swear that
I'll be around for you.
[BURR]
I'll be around for you.

[HAMILTON]
I'll do whatever it takes

[BURR]
I'll make a million mistakes

[BURR/HAMILTON]
I'll make the world safe and sound for you...
...will come of age with our young nation
We'll bleed and fight for you, we'll make it right for you

If we lay a strong enough foundation
We'll pass it on to you, we'll give the world to you
And you'll blow us all away...
Someday, someday
Yeah, you'll blow us all away
Someday, someday

Non-Stop

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[BURR]
After the war I went back to New York

[HAMILTON]
A-After the war I went back to New York

[BURR]
I finished up my studies and I practiced law

[HAMILTON]
I practiced law, Burr worked next door
[BURR]
Even though we started at the very same time
Alexander Hamilton began to climb
How to account for his rise to the top?
Maaaaan, the man is
Non-stop!

[ENSEMBLE]
Non-stop!

[HAMILTON]
Gentlemen of the jury, I'm curious, bear with me
Are you aware that we're making hist'ry?
This is the first murder trial of our brand-new nation
[HAMILTON]
The liberty behind
Deliberation-

[ENSEMBLE]
Non-stop!

[HAMILTON]
I intend to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt
With my assistant counsel-

[BURR]
Co-counsel
Hamilton, sit down
Our client Levi Weeks is innocent. Call your first witness
That's all you had to say!

[HAMILTON]
Okay!
One more thing-

[BURR]
Why do you assume you're the smartest in the room?
Why do you assume you're the smartest in the room?
Why do you assume you're the smartest in the room?
Soon that attitude may be your doom!

[ENSEMBLE]
Awwww!

[BURR]
Why do you write like you're running out of time?
Write day and night like you're running out of time?
Ev'ry day you fight, like you're running out of time

Keep on fighting. In the meantime- [ENSEMBLE]
Why do you write like you're running out of time?

Ev'ry day you fight, like you're running out of time

Non-stop!

[HAMILTON]
Corruption's such an old song that we can sing along in harmony
And nowhere is it stronger than in Albany
This colony's economy's increasingly stalling and

[HAMILTON]
Honestly, that's why public service
Seems to be calling me.

[BURR AND ENSEMBLE]
He's just
Non-stop!

[HAMILTON]
I practiced the law, I practic'ly perfected it
I've seen injustice in the world and I've corrected it
Now for a strong central democracy
If not, then I'll be Socrates
[HAMILTON]
Throwing verbal rocks
At these mediocrities.

[ENSEMBLE]
Awww!

[BURR]
Hamilton, at the Constitutional Convention:

[HAMILTON]
I was chosen for the Constitutional Convention

[BURR]
There as a New York junior delegate:
[HAMILTON]
Now what I'm going to say may sound indelicate...

[BURR]
Goes and proposes his own form of government!

His own plan for a new form of government!

[COMPANY]
Awwww!

What?

What?

[BURR]
Talks for six hours! The convention is listless!

[ENSEMBLE MAN]
Bright young man...

[ANOTHER ENSEMBLE MAN]
Yo, who the f is this?

[BURR]
Why do you always say what you believe?
Why do you always say what you believe?
Ev'ry proclamation guarantees free ammunition for your enemies!

[BURR AND MEN]
Why do you write like it's
Going out of style?
Write day and night like it's
Going out of style?

[COMPANY]
Why do you always say what you believe?
Awww!

[ALL WOMEN]
Going out of style, hey!

Aaron Burr, sir

[BURR]
It's the middle of the night

[HAMILTON]
Can we confer, sir?

[BURR]
Is this a legal matter?

HAMILTON
Yes, and it's important to me

[BURR]
What do you need?

[HAMILTON]
Burr, you're a better lawyer than me

[BURR]
Okay

[HAMILTON]
I know I talk too much, I'm abrasive
You're incredible in court. You're succinct, persuasive
My client needs a strong defense. You're the solution

[BURR]
Who's your client?

[HAMILTON]
The new U.S. Constitution?

[BURR]
No

[HAMILTON]
Hear me out

[BURR]
No way!

[HAMILTON]
A series of essays, anonymously published
Defending the document to the public

[BURR]
No one will read it

[HAMILTON]
I disagree

[BURR]
And if it fails?

[HAMILTON]
Burr, that's why we need it

[BURR]
The constitution's a mess

[HAMILTON]
So it needs amendments

[BURR]
It's full of contradictions

[HAMILTON]
So is independence
We have to start somewhere

[BURR]
No. No way

[HAMILTON]
You're making a mistake

[BURR]
Good night

[HAMILTON]
Hey
What are you waiting for?
What do you stall for?

[BURR]
What?

[HAMILTON]
We won the war
What was it all for?
Do you support this constitution?

[BURR]
Of course

[HAMILTON]
Then defend it

[BURR]
And what if you're backing the wrong horse?

[HAMILTON]
Burr, we studied and we fought and we killed
For the notion of a nation we now get to build
For once in your life, take a stand with pride
I don't understand how you stand to the side

[BURR]
I'll keep all my plans
Close to my chest

I'll wait here and see
Which way the wind
Will blow
I'm taking my time
Watching the
Afterbirth of a nation
Watching the tension grow.

[ENSEMBLE]
Wait for it, wait for
It, wait...

Which way the wind
Will blow
I'm taking my time
Watching the
Afterbirth of a nation
Watching the tension grow.

[ANGELICA]
I am sailing off to London. I'm accompanied by someone
Who always pays
I have found a wealthy husband who will keep
Me in comfort for all my days
He is not a lot of fun, but there's no one who
Can match you for turn of phrase
My Alexander

[HAMILTON]
Angelica

[ANGELICA]
Don't forget to write

[ELIZA]
Look at where you are
Look at where you started
The fact that you're alive is a miracle
Just stay alive, that would be enough
And if your wife could share a fraction of your time
If I could grant you peace of mind
Would that be enough?

[BURR]
Alexander joins forces with James Madison and John Jay to write a series of essays defending the new United States Constitution, entitled The Federalist Papers. The plan was to write a total of twenty-five essays, the work divided evenly among the three men. In the end, they wrote eighty-five essays, in the span of six months. John Jay got sick after writing five. James Madison wrote twenty-nine. Hamilton wrote the other fifty-one!

[BURR]
How do you write like you're
Running out of time?
Write day and night like you're
Running out of time?

[BURR AND MEN]
Ev'ry day you fight
Like you're
Running out of time
Like you're
Running out of time
Are you
Running out of time?
[ALL WOMEN]
Running out of time?
Running out of time?
Running out of time
Running out of time
Awwww!

[FULL COMPANY (EXCEPT HAMILTON)]
How do you write like tomorrow won't arrive?
How do you write like you need it to survive?
How do you write ev'ry second you're alive?
Ev'ry second you're alive? Ev'ry second you're alive?

[WASHINGTON]
They are asking me to lead
I am doing the best I can
To get the people that I need
I'm asking you to be my right hand man

[HAMILTON]
Treasury or State?

[WASHINGTON]
I know it's a lot to ask

[HAMILTON]
Treasury or State?

[WASHINGTON]
To leave behind the world you know...

[HAMILTON]
Sir, do you want me to run the Treasury or State department?

[WASHINGTON]

[HAMILTON]

How does a bastard, orphan, son of a whore and a
Scotsman, dropped in the middle of a
Forgotten spot in the Caribbean by providence
Impoverished, in squalor
Grow up to be a hero and a scholar?

[LAURENS]
The ten-dollar founding father without a father
Got a lot farther by working a lot harder
By being a lot smarter
By being a self-starter
By fourteen, they placed him in charge of a
Trading charter

[JEFFERSON]
And every day while slaves were being slaughtered and carted
Away across the waves, he struggled and kept his guard up
Inside, he was longing for something to be a part of
The brother was ready to beg, steal, borrow, or barter

[MADISON]
Then a hurricane came, and devastation reigned
Our man saw his future drip, dripping down the drain
Put a pencil to his temple, connected it to his brain
And he wrote his first refrain, a testament to his pain

[BURR]
Well, the word got around, they said, "This kid is insane, man"
Took up a collection just to send him to the mainland
"Get your education, don't forget from whence you came, and
The world is gonna know your name. What's your name, man?"

[HAMILTON]
Alexander Hamilton
My name is Alexander Hamilton
And there's a million things I haven't done
But just you wait, just you wait...

[ELIZA]
When he was ten his father split, full of it, debt-ridden
Two years later, see Alex and his mother bed-ridden
Half-dead sittin in their own sick, the scent thick

[COMPANY]
And Alex got better but his mother went quick

[WASHINGTON]
Moved in with a cousin, the cousin committed suicide
Left him with nothin' but ruined pride, something new inside
A voice saying
[WASHINGTON]
"You gotta fend for yourself." [COMPANY]
"Alex, you gotta fend for yourself."

[WASHINGTON]
He started retreatin' and readin' every treatise on the shelf
[BURR]
There would have been nothin' left to do
For someone less astute
He woulda been dead or destitute
Without a cent of restitution
Started workin', clerkin' for his late mother's landlord
Tradin' sugar cane and rum and all the things he can't afford
Scammin' for every book he can get his hands on
Plannin' for the future see him now as he stands on
The bow of a ship headed for a new land
In New York you can be a new man

In New York you can
Be a new man-
In New York you can
Be a new man-

His enemies destroyed his rep
America forgot him

Aaron Burr, Sir

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[COMPANY]
1776. New York City

[HAMILTON]
Pardon me. Are you Aaron Burr, sir?

[BURR]
That depends. Who's asking?

[HAMILTON]
Oh, well, sure, sir
I'm Alexander Hamilton, I'm at your service, sir
I have been looking for you

[BURR]
I'm getting nervous

[HAMILTON]
Sir...
I heard your name at Princeton. I was seeking an accelerated course of study when I got sort of out of sorts with a buddy of yours. I may have punched him. It's a blur, sir. He handles the financials?

[BURR]
You punched the bursar

[HAMILTON]
Yes!
I wanted to do what you did. Graduate in two, then join the revolution. He looked at me like I was stupid, I'm not stupid

So how'd you do it? How'd you graduate so fast?

[BURR]
It was my parents' dying wish before they passed

[HAMILTON]
You're an orphan. Of course! I'm an orphan
God, I wish there was a war!
Then we could prove that we're worth more
Than anyone bargained for...

[BURR]
Can I buy you a drink?

[HAMILTON]
That would be nice

[BURR]
While we're talking, let me offer you some free advice
Talk less

[HAMILTON]
What?

[BURR]
Smile more

[HAMILTON]
Ha

[BURR]
Don't let them know what you're against or what you're for

[HAMILTON]
You can't be serious

[BURR]
You wanna get ahead?

[HAMILTON]
Yes

[BURR]
Fools who run their mouths off wind up dead

[LAURENS]
Yo yo yo yo yo!
What time is it?

[LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
Show time!

[BURR]
...like I said...

[LAURENS]
Show time! Show time! Yo!
I'm John Laurens in the place to be!
Two pints o' Sam Adams, but I'm workin' on three, uh!
Those redcoats don't want it with me!
Cuz I will pop chick-a pop these cops till I'm free!

[LAFAYETTE]
Oui oui, mon ami, je m'appelle Lafayette!
The Lancelot of the revolutionary set!
I came from afar just to say "Bonsoir!"
Tell the King "Casse toi!" Who's the best?
C'est moi!

[MULLIGAN]
Brrrah brraaah! I am Hercules Mulligan
Up in it, lovin' it, yes I heard ya mother said "Come again?"
Lock up ya daughters and horses, of course
It's hard to have intercourse over four sets of corsets...

[LAURENS]
No more sex, pour me another brew, son!
Let's raise a couple more...

[LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
To the revolution!

[LAURENS]
Well, if it ain't the prodigy of Princeton college!

[MULLIGAN]
Aaron Burr!

[LAURENS]
Give us a verse, drop some knowledge!

[BURR]
Good luck with that: you're takin' a stand
You spit. I'm ‘a sit. We'll see where we land

[LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
Boooo!

[LAURENS]
Burr, the revolution's imminent. What do you stall for?

[HAMILTON]
If you stand for nothing, Burr, what'll you fall for?

Ooh
Who are you? [MULLIGAN]

Who are you? [LAFAYETTE]

My Shot

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[HAMILTON]
I am not throwing away my shot!
I am not throwing away my shot!
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot!
I'm ‘a get a scholarship to King's College
I prob'ly shouldn't brag, but dag, I amaze and astonish
The problem is I got a lot of brains but no polish
I gotta holler just to be heard
With every word, I drop knowledge!
I'm a diamond in the rough, a shiny piece of coal
Tryin' to reach my goal. My power of speech: unimpeachable
Only nineteen but my mind is older
These New York City streets get colder, I shoulder
Ev'ry burden, ev'ry disadvantage
I have learned to manage, I don't have a gun to brandish
I walk these streets famished
The plan is to fan this spark into a flame
But damn, it's getting dark, so let me spell out the name
I am the-

[HAMILTON/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN/LAURENS]
A-L-E-X-A-N-D
E-R-we are-meant to be...

[HAMILTON]
A colony that runs independently
Meanwhile, Britain keeps shittin' on us endlessly
Essentially, they tax us relentlessly
Then King George turns around, runs a spending spree
He ain't ever gonna set his descendants free
So there will be a revolution in this century
Enter me!

[LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN/LAURENS]
(He says in parentheses)

[HAMILTON]
Don't be shocked when your hist'ry book mentions me
I will lay down my life if it sets us free
Eventually, you'll see my ascendancy
[HAMILTON]
And I am not throwing away
My shot
I am not throwing away
My shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot
[LAURENS]
My shot!

My shot!

And I'm not throwing away my shot.

[HAMILTON/MULLIGAN/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE]
I am not throwing away my shot
I am not throwing away my shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot
It's time to take a shot!

[LAFAYETTE]
I dream of life without a monarchy
The unrest in France will lead to ‘onarchy?
‘Onarchy? How you say, how you say, ‘anarchy?'
When I fight, I make the other side panicky
With my-

[HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
Shot!

[MULLIGAN]
Yo, I'm a tailor's apprentice
And I got y'all knuckleheads in loco parentis
I'm joining the rebellion cuz I know it's my chance
To socially advance, instead of sewin' some pants!
I'm gonna take a-

[HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
Shot!

[LAURENS]
But we'll never be truly free
Until those in bondage have the same rights as you and me
You and I. Do or die. Wait till I sally in
On a stallion with the first black battalion
Have another-

[HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
Shot!

[BURR]
Geniuses, lower your voices
You keep out of trouble and you double your choices
I'm with you, but the situation is fraught
You've got to be carefully taught:
If you talk, you're gonna get shot!

[HAMILTON]
Burr, check what we got
Mister Lafayette, hard rock like Lancelot
I think your pants look hot
Laurens, I like you a lot
Let's hatch a plot blacker than the kettle callin' the pot...
What are the odds the gods would put us all in one spot
Poppin' a squat on conventional wisdom, like it or not
A bunch of revolutionary manumission abolitionists?
Give me a position, show me where the ammunition is!

Oh, am I talkin' too loud?
Sometimes I get over excited, shoot off at the mouth
I never had a group of friends before
I promise that I'll make y'all proud

[LAURENS]
Let's get this guy in front of a crowd

[HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN/ENSEMBLE]
I am not throwing away my shot
I am not throwing away my shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot

I am not throwing away my shot
I am not throwing away my shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot
[LAURENS]
Ev'rybody sing:
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Hey!
Whoa!
Wooh!!

Ay, let ‘em hear ya!

Let's go!

I imagine death so much it feels more like a memory
When's it gonna get me?
In my sleep? Seven feet ahead of me?
If I see it comin', do I run or do I let it be?
Is it like a beat without a melody?
See, I never thought I'd live past twenty
Where I come from some get half as many
Ask anybody why we livin' fast and we laugh, reach for a flask
We have to make this moment last, that's plenty

Scratch that
This is not a moment, it's the movement
Where all the hungriest brothers with
Something to prove went?
Foes oppose us, we take an honest stand
We roll like Moses, claimin' our promised land
And? If we win our independence?
‘Zat a guarantee of freedom for our descendants?
Or will the blood we shed begin an endless
Cycle of vengeance and death with no defendants?
I know the action in the street is excitin'
But Jesus, between all the bleedin' ‘n fightin'
I've been readin' ‘n writin'
We need to handle our financial situation
Are we a nation of states? What's the state of our nation?
I'm past patiently waitin'. I'm passionately
Smashin' every expectation
Every action's an act of creation!
I'm laughin' in the face of casualties and sorrow
For the first time, I'm thinkin' past tomorrow

There's nothing rich folks love more
Than going downtown and slummin' it with the poor
They pull up in their carriages and gawk
At the students in the common
Just to watch them talk
Take Philip Schuyler: the man is loaded
Uh-oh, but little does he know that
His daughters, Peggy, Angelica, Eliza
Sneak into the city just to watch all the guys at-

You searchin for an urchin who can give you ideals?

Ah, so you've discussed me

Farmer Refuted

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[SEABURY]
Hear ye, hear ye! My name is Samuel Seabury
And I present "Free Thoughts on the
Proceedings of the Continental Congress!"
Heed not the rabble who scream revolution
They have not your interests at heart

[MULLIGAN]
Oh my God. Tear this dude apart

[SEABURY]
Chaos and bloodshed are not a solution
Don't let them lead you astray
This Congress does not speak for me

[BURR]
Let him be

[SEABURY]
They're playing a dangerous game
I pray the king shows you his mercy
For shame, for shame...
[HAMILTON]
Yo!
He'd have you all unravel at the
Sound of screams but the
Revolution is comin'
The have-nots are gonna
Win this
It's hard to listen to you with a straight face

Chaos and bloodshed already haunt us, honestly you shouldn't even talk. And what about Boston? Look at the cost, n' all that we've lost n' you talk
About Congress?!

My dog speaks more eloquently than thee!

But strangely, your mange is the same

Is he in Jersey?

For the revolution!
[SEABURY]
Heed not the rabble
Who scream
Revolution, they
Have not your
Interests
At heart

Chaos and bloodshed are
Not a
Solution. Don't
Let them lead you
Astray
This Congress does not
Speak for me

They're playing a dangerous game

I pray the king shows you his mercy

For shame

For shame,

[COMPANY]
For the revolution!

[SEABURY]
Heed-

[HAMILTON]
If you repeat yourself again I'm gonna-

[SEABURY/HAMILTON]
Scream-

[HAMILTON]
Honestly, look at me, please don't read!

[SEABURY]
Not your interests-

[HAMILTON]
Don't modulate the key then not debate with me!
Why should a tiny island across the sea regulate the price of tea?

[BURR]
Alexander, please!

[HAMILTON]
Burr, I'd rather be divisive than indecisive, drop the niceties

Silence! A message from the King!

You'll Be Back

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[KING GEORGE]
You say
The price of my love's not a price that you're willing to pay
You cry
In your tea which you hurl in the sea when you see me go by
Why so sad?
Remember we made an arrangement when you went away
Now you're making me mad
Remember, despite our estrangement, I'm your man
You'll be back
Soon you'll see
You'll remember you belong to me
You'll be back
Time will tell
You'll remember that I served you well
Oceans rise
Empires fall
We have seen each other through it all
And when push
Comes to shove
I will send a fully armed battalion
To remind you of my love!

Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da
Da da dat dat da ya da!
Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da
Da da dat dat da...

You say our love is draining and you can't go on
You'll be the one complaining when I am gone...
And no, don't change the subject
Cuz you're my favorite subject
My sweet, submissive subject
My loyal, royal subject
Forever and ever and ever and ever and ever...

You'll be back
Like before
I will fight the fight and win the war
For your love
For your praise
And I'll love you till my dying days
When you're gone
I'll go mad
So don't throw away this thing we had

Cuz when push comes to shove
I will kill your friends and family to remind you of my love
Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da
Da da dat dat da ya da!
Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da
Da da dat-
Everybody!

[ENSEMBLE]
Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da

Buck, buck, buck, buck, buck!

Buck, buck, buck, buck, buck!

[WASHINGTON]
Check it-
Can I be real a second?
For just a millisecond?
Let down my guard and tell the people how I feel a second?
Now I'm the model of a modern major general
The venerated Virginian veteran whose men are all
Lining up, to put me up on a pedestal
Writin' letters to relatives
Embellishin' my elegance and eloquence
But the elephant is in the room
The truth is in ya face when ya hear the British cannons go...

[ENSEMBLE]
Boom!

[WASHINGTON]
Any hope of success is fleeting
How can I keep leading when the people I'm
Leading keep retreating?
We put a stop to the bleeding as the British take Brooklyn
Knight takes rook, but look
[WASHINGTON]
We are outgunned

Outmanned

Outnumbered
Outplanned

We gotta make an all out stand
Ayo, I'm gonna need a right-hand man

There's another ship and...

[WASHINGTON]
We just lost the southern tip and...

[COMPANY]
Boom!

[WASHINGTON]
We gotta run to Harlem quick, we can't afford another slip
Guns and horses giddyup
I decide to divvy up
My forces, they're skittish as the British cut the city up
This close to giving up, facing mad scrutiny
I scream in the face of this mass mutiny:
Are these the men with which I am to defend America?
We ride at midnight, Manhattan in the distance
I cannot be everywhere at once, people
I'm in dire need of assistance...

[BURR]
Your excellency, sir!

[WASHINGTON]
Who are you?

[BURR]
Aaron Burr, Sir?
Permission to state my case?

[WASHINGTON]
As you were

[BURR]
Sir
I was a captain under General Montgomery
Until he caught a bullet in the neck in Quebec
And well, in summary
I think that I could be of some assistance
I admire how you keep firing on the British
From a distance

[WASHINGTON]
Huh

[BURR]
I have some questions, a couple of suggestions on how to fight instead of fleeing west

[WASHINGTON]
Yes?

[BURR]
Well-

[HAMILTON]
Your excellency, you wanted to see me?

[WASHINGTON]
Hamilton, come in, have you met Burr?

[HAMILTON]
Yes, sir

As I was saying, sir, I look forward to seeing your strategy play out

[WASHINGTON]
Burr?

[BURR]
Sir?

[WASHINGTON]
Close the door on your way out

[HAMILTON]
Have I done something wrong, sir?

[WASHINGTON]
On the contrary
I called you here because our odds are beyond scary
Your reputation precedes you, but I have to laugh

[HAMILTON]
Sir?

[WASHINGTON]
Hamilton, how come no one can get you on their staff?

[HAMILTON]
Sir!

[WASHINGTON]
Don't get me wrong, you're a young man, of great renown
I know you stole British cannons when we were still downtown
Nathaniel Green and Henry Knox wanted to hire you...

[HAMILTON]
To be their Secretary? I don't think so

[WASHINGTON]
Why're you upset?

[HAMILTON]
I'm not-

[WASHINGTON]
It's alright, you want to fight, you've got a hunger
I was just like you when I was younger
Head full of fantasies of dyin' like a martyr?

[HAMILTON]
Yes

[WASHINGTON]
Dying is easy, young man. Living is harder

[HAMILTON]
Why are you telling me this?

[WASHINGTON]
I'm being honest
I'm working with a third of what our Congress has promised
We are a powder keg about to explode
I need someone like you to lighten the load. So?

[COMPANY (EXCEPT HAMILTON)]
I am not throwin' away my shot!
I am not throwin' away my shot!
Ayo, I'm just like my country, I'm young
Scrappy and hungry!

You need all the help you can get
I have some friends. Laurens, Mulligan
Marquis de Lafayette, okay, what else?

[WASHINGTON AND COMPANY]
Outnumbered, outplanned!

[HAMILTON]
We'll need some spies on the inside
Some King's men who might let some things slide
[HAMILTON]
I'll write to Congress and tell ‘em we need supplies, you rally the guys, master the element of surprise

I'll rise above my station, organize your information, ‘til we rise to the occasion of our new nation. Sir!

A Winter's Ball

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[BURR]
How does the bastard, orphan, son of a whore
Go on and on
Grow into more of a phenomenon?
Watch this obnoxious, arrogant, loudmouth bother
Be seated at the right hand of the father
Washington hires Hamilton right on sight
But Hamilton still wants to fight, not write
Now Hamilton's skill with a quill is undeniable
But what do we have in common? We're
Reliable with the

Helpless!
Look into your eyes, and the sky's the limit I'm helpless!
Down for the count, and I'm drownin' in ‘em

[ELIZA]
I have never been the type to try and grab the spotlight
We were at a revel with some rebels on a hot night
Laughin' at my sister as she's dazzling the room
Then you walked in and my heart went "Boom!"
Tryin' to catch your eye from the side of the ballroom
Everybody's dancin' and the band's top volume

[ELIZA AND WOMEN]
Grind to the rhythm as we wine and dine
[ELIZA]
Grab my sister, and
Whisper, "Yo, this
One's mine."

My sister made her way across the room to you
And I got nervous, thinking "What's she gonna do?"
She grabbed you by the arm, I'm thinkin' "I'm through"
Then you look back at me and suddenly I'm
Helpless!

Oh, look at those eyes

Oh!
Yeah, I'm
Helpless, I know

I'm so into you
I am so into you

I know I'm down for the count
And I'm drownin' in ‘em.

Oooh

I'm about to change your life

[HAMILTON]
Then by all means, lead the way

[ELIZA]
Elizabeth Schuyler. It's a pleasure to meet you

[HAMILTON]
Schuyler?

[ANGELICA]
My sister

[ELIZA]
Thank you for all your service

[HAMILTON]
If it takes fighting a war for us to meet, it will have been worth it

[ANGELICA]
I'll leave you to it

[ELIZA AND WOMEN]
One week later

[ELIZA]
I'm writin' a letter nightly
Now my life gets better, every letter that you write me
Laughin' at my sister, cuz she wants to form a harem

[ANGELICA]
I'm just sayin', if you really loved me, you would share him
[ELIZA]
Ha!
Two weeks later
In the living room stressin'
My father's stone-faced
While you're asking for his blessin'
I'm dying inside, as
You wine
And dine
And I'm tryin' not to cry
‘cause there's nothing that your mind can't do
My father makes his way across the room
To you
I panic for a second, thinking
"we're through"
But then he shakes your hand and says
"Be true"
And you turn back to me, smiling, and I'm
Helpless!

Helpless!
Hoo!

That boy is mine
That boy is mine!

Helpless! Helpless!
Down for the count
And I'm drownin' in em

[ALL WOMEN]
Stressin'

Blessin'

Oooh

Oooh

Oooh

Oooh

Helpless!
Look into your eyes
And the sky's the
Limit I'm
Helpless!
Down for the count
And I'm drownin' in
‘em I'm
Helpless!

Look into your eyes
And the sky's the
Limit I'm
Helpless!
Down for the count
And I'm drownin' in em

[HAMILTON]
Eliza, I don't have a dollar to my name
An acre of land, a troop to command, a dollop of fame
All I have's my honor, a tolerance for pain
A couple of college credits and my top-notch brain
Insane, your family brings out a different side of me
Peggy confides in me, Angelica tried to take a bite of me
No stress, my love for you is never in doubt
We'll get a little place in Harlem and we'll figure it out
I've been livin' without a family since I was a child
My father left, my mother died, I grew up buckwild
But I'll never forget my mother's face, that was real
And long as I'm alive, Eliza, swear to God
You'll never feel so...

[HAMILTON]
Eliza...

I've never felt so-

My life is gon' be fine cuz Eliza's in it.
[ELIZA]
I do I do I do I do!

I do I do I do I do!

Hey, yeah, yeah!

I'm down for the count
I'm-

I look into your eyes, and the sky's the limit
I'm

...drownin' in ‘em. [ALL WOMEN]
Helpless!

Helpless!

Helpless!

Down for the count
And I'm drownin' in ‘em

Helpless!

Helpless!

Helpless!

Down for the count
And I'm drownin' in ‘em.

Wedding march plays

[ALL WOMEN]
In New York, you can be a new man...
In New York, you can be a new man...
In New York, you can be a new man...

Satisfied

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[LAURENS]
Alright, alright. That's what I'm talkin' about!
Now everyone give it up for the maid of honor
Angelica Schuyler!
[ANGELICA]
A toast to the groom!

To the bride!

From your sister

Who is always by your side

To your union

And the hope that you provide

May you always...

Be satisfied.

[ALL MEN]
To the groom!
To the groom!
To the groom!

To the bride!
To the bride!

Angelica!
Angelica!
Angelica!

By your side!

To the union!
To the revolution!

You provide!
You provide!

[HAMILTON AND MEN]
Always-

Rewind-

[ALL WOMEN]
To the groom!

To the bride!

To the bride!

[ELIZA AND WOMEN]
Angelica!

By your side!

To the union!
To the revolution!

You provide!

Always-

Rewind-

[ANGELICA]
I remember that night, I just might
Regret that night for the rest of my days

I remember those soldier boys
Tripping over themselves to win our praise

I remember that dreamlike candlelight
Like a dream that you can't quite place

But Alexander, I'll never forget the first
Time I saw your face

I have never been the same
Intelligent eyes in a hunger-pang frame
And when you said "Hi," I forgot my dang name
Set my heart aflame, ev'ry part aflame

[FULL COMPANY]
This is not a game...

[HAMILTON]
You strike me as a woman who has never been satisfied

[ANGELICA]
I'm sure I don't know what you mean. You forget yourself

[HAMILTON]
You're like me. I'm never satisfied

[ANGELICA]
Is that right?

[HAMILTON]
I have never been satisfied

[ANGELICA]
My name is Angelica Schuyler

[HAMILTON]
Alexander Hamilton

[ANGELICA]
Where's your fam'ly from?

[HAMILTON]
Unimportant. There's a million things I haven't done but
Just you wait, just you wait...

[ANGELICA]
So so so-
So this is what it feels like to match wits
With someone at your level! What the hell is the catch? It's
The feeling of freedom, of seein' the light
It's Ben Franklin with a key and a kite! You see it, right?
The conversation lasted two minutes, maybe three minutes
Ev'rything we said in total agreement, it's
A dream and it's a bit of a dance
A bit of a posture, it's a bit of a stance. He's a
Bit of a flirt, but I'm ‘a give it a chance
I asked about his fam'ly, did you see his answer?
His hands started fidgeting, he looked askance?
He's penniless, he's flying by the seat of his pants

Handsome, boy, does he know it!
Peach fuzz, and he can't even grow it!
I wanna take him far away from this place
Then I turn and see my sister's face and she is...

[ELIZA]
Helpless...

[ANGELICA]
And I know she is...

[ELIZA]
Helpless...

[ANGELICA]
And her eyes are just...

[ELIZA]
Helpless...

[ANGELICA]
And I realize

[ANGELICA AND COMPANY]
Three fundamental truths at the exact same time...

[HAMILTON]
Where are you taking me?

[ANGELICA]
I'm about to change your life

[HAMILTON]
Then by all means, lead the way

[COMPANY (EXCEPT ANGELICA)]
Number one!

[ANGELICA]
I'm a girl in a world in which
My only job is to marry rich
My father has no sons so I'm the one
Who has to social climb for one
So I'm the oldest and the wittiest and the gossip in
New York City is insidious
Alexander is penniless
Ha! That doesn't mean I want him any less

[ELIZA]
Elizabeth Schuyler. It's a pleasure to meet you

[HAMILTON]
Schuyler?

[ANGELICA]
My sister

[COMPANY]
Number two!

[ANGELICA]
He's after me cuz I'm a Schuyler sister
That elevates his status, I'd
Have to be naïve to set that aside
Maybe that is why I introduce him to Eliza
Now that's his bride
Nice going, Angelica, he was right
You will never be satisfied

[ELIZA]
Thank you for all your service

[HAMILTON]
If it takes fighting a war for us to meet, it will have been worth it

[ANGELICA]
I'll leave you to it

[COMPANY]
Number three!

[ANGELICA]
I know my sister like I know my own mind
You will never find anyone as trusting or as kind
If I tell her that I love him she'd be silently resigned
He'd be mine
She would say, "I'm fine"

[ANGELICA AND COMPANY]
She'd be lying

[ANGELICA]
But when I fantasize at night
It's Alexander's eyes
As I romanticize what might
Have been if I hadn't sized him
Up so quickly
At least my dear Eliza's his wife;
At least I keep his eyes in my life...
[ANGELICA]
To the groom!

To the bride!

From your sister

Who is always by your side

To your union

And the hope that you provide

May you always

Be satisfied

And I know

She'll be happy as

His bride
And I know [ALL MEN (EXCEPT HAMILTON)]
To the groom!
To the groom!
To the groom!

To the bride!
To the bride!

Angelica!
Angelica!

By your side

To the union!
To the revolution!

You provide!
You provide!

[HAMILTON AND MEN]
Always-

Be satisfied

Be satisfied

[MEN]
Be satisfied
Be satisfied
Be satisfied
Be satisfied

Be satisfied
Be satisfied

Be satisfied
Be satisfied
Be satisfied
Be satisfied.

[ALL WOMEN (EXCEPT ELIZA)]
To the groom!

To the bride!

To the bride!

[ELIZA AND WOMEN]
Angelica!

By your side

To the union!
To the revolution!

You provide!

Always-

Be satisfied

[WOMEN]
Be satisfied

Be satisfied

Be satisfied.

[ANGELICA]
He will never be satisfied
I will never be satisfied

The Story of Tonight (Reprise)

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[LAURENS]
I may not live to see our glory!

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE]
I may not live to see our glory!

[LAURENS]
But I've seen wonders great and small

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE]
I've seen wonders great and small

[LAURENS]
‘Cause if the tomcat can get married

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE]
If Alexander can get married-

[LAURENS]
There's hope for our ass, after all!

[LAFAYETTE]
Raise a glass to freedom

[LAURENS/MULLIGAN]
Hey!
Something you will never see again!

[MULLIGAN]
No matter what she tells you

[LAFAYETTE]
Let's have another round tonight!

[LAURENS]
Raise a glass to the four of us!

[LAFAYETTE/HAMILTON]
Ho!

[MULLIGAN]
To the newly not poor of us!

[LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/HAMILTON]
Woo!

[LAFAYETTE]
We'll tell the story of tonight

[LAURENS]
Let's have another round-

[HAMILTON]
Well, if it isn't Aaron Burr

[BURR]
Sir!

[HAMILTON]
I didn't think that you would make it

[BURR]
To be sure

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE]
Burr!

[BURR]
I came to say congratulations

[MULLIGAN]
Spit a verse, Burr!

[BURR]
I see the whole gang is here

[LAFAYETTE]
You are the worst, Burr!

[HAMILTON]
Ignore them. Congrats to you, Lieutenant Colonel
I wish I had your command instead of manning George's journal

[BURR]
No, you don't

[HAMILTON]
Yes, I do

[BURR]
Now, be sensible
From what I hear, you've made yourself indispensable

[LAURENS]
Well, well, I heard
You've got a special someone on the side, Burr

[HAMILTON]
Is that so?

[LAURENS]
What are you tryin' to hide, Burr?

[BURR]
I should go

[HAMILTON]
No, these guys should go

[LAFAYETTE]
What?

[LAURENS]
No!

[HAMILTON]
Leave us alone

[MULLIGAN]
Man...

[HAMILTON]
It's alright, Burr. I wish you'd brought this girl with you tonight, Burr

[BURR]
You're very kind, but I'm afraid it's unlawful, sir

[HAMILTON]
What do you mean?

[BURR]
She's married

[HAMILTON]
I see

[BURR]
She's married to a British officer

[HAMILTON]
Oh shit...

[BURR]
Congrats again, Alexander. Smile more
I'll see you on the other side of the war

[HAMILTON]
I will never understand you
If you love this woman, go get her! What are you waiting for?

[BURR]
I'll see you on the other side of the war

[HAMILTON]
I'll see you on the other side of the war

Wait For It

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[BURR]
Theodosia writes me a letter everyday
I'm keeping the bed warm while her husband is away
He's on the British side in Georgia
He's trying to keep the colonies in line
But he can keep all of Georgia
Theodosia, she's mine

Love doesn't discriminate
Between the sinners
And the saints
It takes and it takes and it takes
And we keep loving anyway
We laugh and we cry
And we break
And we make our mistakes
And if there's a reason I'm by her side
When so many have tried
Then I'm willing to wait for it
I'm willing to wait for it
[BURR]
My grandfather was a fire and brimstone preacher

But there are things that the
Homilies and hymns won't teach ya

My mother was a genius

My father commanded respect

When they died they left no instructions
Just a legacy to protect

[MEN]
Preacher, preacher
Preacher

Teach ya, teach ya, teach ya

Respect, respect

[WOMEN]
Genius

[BURR/ENSEMBLE]
Death doesn't discriminate
Between the sinners
And the saints
It takes and it takes and it takes
And we keep living anyway
We rise and we fall
And we break
And we make our mistakes
And if there's a reason I'm still alive
When everyone who loves me has died
I'm willing to wait for it
I'm willing to wait for it

Wait for it

[ENSEMBLE]
Wait for it
Wait for it
Wait for it

[BURR]
I am the one thing in life I can control

[ENSEMBLE]
Wait for it
Wait for it
Wait for it
Wait for it

[BURR]
I am inimitable
I am an original

[ENSEMBLE]
Wait for it
Wait for it
Wait for it
Wait for it

[BURR]
I'm not falling behind or running late

[ENSEMBLE]
Wait for it
Wait for it
Wait for it
Wait for it

[BURR]
I'm not standing still
I am lying in wait

[ENSEMBLE]
Wait
Wait
Wait

[BURR]
Hamilton faces an endless uphill climb

[ENSEMBLE]
Climb
Climb
Climb

[BURR]
He has something to prove
He has nothing to lose

[ENSEMBLE]
Lose
Lose
Lose
Lose

[BURR]
Hamilton's pace is relentless
He wastes no time

[ENSEMBLE]
Time
Time
Time

[BURR]
What is it like in his shoes?

Hamilton doesn't hesitate
He exhibits no restraint
He takes and he takes and he takes
And he keeps winning anyway
He changes the game
He plays and he raises the stakes
And if there's a reason
He seems to thrive when so few survive, then Goddamnit-
[BURR]
I'm willing to wait for it

I'm willing to wait for it...

Life doesn't discriminate
Between the sinners and the saints
It takes and it takes and it takes

We rise
We fall

And if there's a reason I'm still alive
When so many have died
Then I'm willin' to-
[COMPANY]
I'm willing to wait for it
Wait for it
Wait for...
I'm willing to-

Life doesn't discriminate
Between the sinners and the saints
It takes and it takes and it takes
And we keep living anyway
We rise and we fall and we break
And we make our mistakes
And if there's a reason I'm still alive
When so many have died
Then I'm willin' to-

Stay Alive

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[ELIZA]
Stay alive...

[ELIZA/ANGELICA/ENSEMBLE WOMEN]
Stay alive...

[HAMILTON]
I have never seen the General so despondent
I have taken over writing all his correspondence
Congress writes, "George, attack the British forces."
I shoot back, we have resorted to eating our horses
Local merchants deny us equipment, assistance
They only take British money, so sing a song of sixpence

[WASHINGTON]
The cavalry's not coming

[HAMILTON]
Sir!

[WASHINGTON]
Alex, listen. There's only one way for us to win this
Provoke outrage, outright

[HAMILTON]
That's right

[WASHINGTON]
Don't engage, strike by night
Remain relentless ‘til their troops take flight

[HAMILTON]
Make it impossible to justify the cost of the fight

[WASHINGTON]
Outrun

[HAMILTON]
Outrun

[WASHINGTON]
Outlast

[HAMILTON]
Outlast

[WASHINGTON]
Hit ‘em quick, get out fast

[HAMILTON]
Chick-a-plao!

[WASHINGTON]
Stay alive ‘til this horror show is past
We're gonna fly a lot of flags half-mast

[HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE]
Raise a glass!

[MULLIGAN]
I go back to New York and my apprenticeship

[LAFAYETTE]
I ask for French aid, I pray that France has sent a ship

[LAURENS]
I stay at work with Hamilton
We write essays against slavery
And every day's a test of our camaraderie
And bravery

[HAMILTON]
We cut supply lines, we steal contraband
We pick and choose our battles and places to take a stand
And ev'ry day
"Sir, entrust me with a command,"
And ev'ry day

[WASHINGTON]
No

[HAMILTON]
He dismisses me out of hand
[HAMILTON]
Instead of me
He promotes
Charles Lee
Makes him second-in-command:

[LEE]
Charles Lee. [ELIZA/ANGELICA]
Stay alive...

[LEE]
I'm a General. Whee!!!!

[HAMILTON]
Yeah. He's not the choice I would have gone with

[HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE]
He shits the bed at the Battle of Monmouth

[WASHINGTON]
Ev'ryone attack!

[LEE]
Retreat!

[WASHINGTON]
Attack!

[LEE]
Retreat!

[WASHINGTON]
What are you doing, Lee? Get back on your feet!

[LEE]
But there's so many of them!

[WASHINGTON]
I'm sorry, is this not your speed?!
Hamilton!

[HAMILTON]
Ready, sir!

[WASHINGTON]
Have Lafayette take the lead!

[HAMILTON]
Yes, sir!

[LAURENS]
A thousand soldiers die in a hundred degree heat

[LAFAYETTE]
As we snatch a stalemate from the jaws of defeat

[HAMILTON]
Charles Lee was left behind
Without a pot to piss in
He started sayin' this to anybody who would listen:

[LEE]
Washington cannot be left alone to his devices
Indecisive, from crisis to crisis
The best thing he can do for the revolution
Is turn n' go back to plantin' tobacco in Mount Vernon

[COMPANY]
Oo!!

[WASHINGTON]
Don't do a thing. History will prove him wrong

[HAMILTON]
But, sir!

[WASHINGTON]
We have a war to fight, let's move along

[LAURENS]
Strong words from Lee, someone oughta hold him to it

[HAMILTON]
I can't disobey direct orders

[LAURENS]
Then I'll do it
Alexander, you're the closest friend I've got

[HAMILTON]
Laurens, do not throw away your shot

Ten Duel Commandments

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[MEN]
One, two, three, four

[FULL COMPANY]
Five, six, seven, eight, nine...

[BURR/HAMILTON/LAURENS/LEE]
It's the Ten Duel Commandments

[FULL COMPANY]
It's the Ten Duel Commandments
Number one!

[LAURENS]
The challenge: demand satisfaction
If they apologize, no need for further action

[COMPANY]
Number two!

[LAURENS]
If they don't, grab a friend, that's your second

[HAMILTON]
Your lieutenant when there's reckoning to be reckoned

[COMPANY]
Number three!

[LEE]
Have your seconds meet face to face

[BURR]
Negotiate a peace...

[HAMILTON]
Or negotiate a time and place

[BURR]
This is commonplace, ‘specially ‘tween recruits

[COMPANY]
Most disputes die, and no one shoots
Number four!

[LAURENS]
If they don't reach a peace, that's alright
Time to get some pistols and a doctor on site

[HAMILTON]
You pay him in advance, you treat him with civility

[BURR]
You have him turn around so he can have deniability

[COMPANY]
Five!

[LEE]
Duel before the sun is in the sky

[COMPANY]
Pick a place to die where it's high and dry
Number six!

[HAMILTON]
Leave a note for your next of kin
Tell ‘em where you been. Pray that hell or heaven lets you in

[COMPANY]
Seven!

[LEE]
Confess your sins. Ready for the moment of adrenaline when you finally face your opponent

[COMPANY]
Number eight!

[LAURENS/LEE/HAMILTON/BURR]
Your last chance to negotiate
Send in your seconds, see if they can set the record straight...

[BURR]
Alexander

[HAMILTON]
Aaron Burr, sir

[BURR]
Can we agree that duels are dumb and immature?

[HAMILTON]
Sure
But your man has to answer for his words, Burr

[BURR]
With his life? We both know that's absurd, sir

[HAMILTON]
Hang on, how many men died because Lee was inexperienced and ruinous?

[BURR]
Okay, so we're doin' this

[COMPANY]
Number nine!

[HAMILTON]
Look ‘em in the eye, aim no higher
Summon all the courage you require
Then count

[MEN]
One two three four

[FULL COMPANY]
Five six seven eight nine

[HAMILTON/BURR]
Number

[COMPANY]
Ten paces!

[HAMILTON/BURR]
Fire!

Meet Me Inside

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[HAMILTON]
Lee, do you yield?

[BURR]
You shot him in the side!
Yes, he yields!

[LAURENS]
I'm satisfied

[BURR]
Yo, we gotta clear the field!

[HAMILTON]
Go! We won

[COMPANY]
Here comes the General!

[BURR]
This should be fun

[WASHINGTON]
What is the meaning of this? Mr. Burr, get a medic for the General

[BURR]
Yes, sir

[WASHINGTON]
Lee, you will never agree with me
But believe me, these young men don't speak for me
Thank you for your service

[BURR]
Let's ride!

[WASHINGTON]
Hamilton!

[HAMILTON]
Sir!

[WASHINGTON]
Meet me inside

[COMPANY]
Meet him inside! Meet him inside!
Meet him inside, meet him, meet him inside!

[WASHINGTON]
Son-

[HAMILTON]
Don't call me son

[WASHINGTON]
This war is hard enough
Without infighting-

[HAMILTON]
Lee called you out. We called his bluff

[WASHINGTON]
You solve nothing, you aggravate our allies to the south

[HAMILTON]
You're absolutely right, John should have shot him in the mouth
That would've shut him up

[WASHINGTON]
Son-

[HAMILTON]
I'm notcha son-

[WASHINGTON]
Watch your tone
I am not a maiden in need of defending, I am grown

[HAMILTON (OVERLAPPING)]
Charles Lee, Thomas Conway
These men take your name and they rake it
Through the mud

[WASHINGTON]
My name's been through a lot, I can take it

[HAMILTON]
Well, I don't have your name. I don't have your titles
I don't have your land
But, if you-

[WASHINGTON]
No-

[HAMILTON]
If you gave me command of a battalion, a group of men to lead, I could fly above my station after the war

[WASHINGTON]
Or you could die and we need you alive

[HAMILTON]
I'm more than willing to die-

[WASHINGTON]
Your wife needs you alive, son, I need you alive-

[HAMILTON]
Call me son one more time-

[WASHINGTON]
Go home, Alexander
That's an order from your commander

[HAMILTON]
Sir-

[WASHINGTON]
Go home

That Would Be Enough

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[ELIZA]
Look around, look around at how lucky we are
To be alive right now
Look around, look around...

[HAMILTON]
How long have you known?

[ELIZA]
A month or so

[HAMILTON]
Eliza, you should have told me

[ELIZA]
I wrote to the General a month ago

[HAMILTON]
No

[ELIZA]
I begged him to send you home

[HAMILTON]
You should have told me

[ELIZA]
I'm not sorry
[ELIZA]
I knew you'd fight
Until the war was won

But you deserve a chance to meet your son
Look around, look around at how lucky we are
To be alive right now.
[HAMILTON]
The war's not
Done.

[HAMILTON]
Will you relish being a poor man's wife
Unable to provide for your life?

[ELIZA]
I relish being your wife
Look around, look around...

Look at where you are
Look at where you started
The fact that you're alive is a miracle
Just stay alive, that would be enough

And if this child
Shares a fraction of your smile
Or a fragment of your mind, look out world!
That would be enough

I don't pretend to know
The challenges you're facing
The worlds you keep erasing and creating in your mind

But I'm not afraid
I know who I married
So long as you come home at the end of the day
That would be enough

We don't need a legacy
We don't need money
If I could grant you peace of mind

If you could let me inside your heart...
Oh, let me be a part of the narrative
In the story they will write someday
Let this moment be the first chapter:
Where you decide to stay
And I could be enough
And we could be enough
That would be enough

Guns and Ships

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[BURR]
How does a ragtag volunteer army in need of a shower
Somehow defeat a global superpower?
How do we emerge victorious from the quagmire?
Leave the battlefield waving Betsy Ross' flag higher?
Yo. Turns out we have a secret weapon!
An immigrant you know and love who's unafraid to step in!
He's constantly confusin', confoundin' the British henchmen
Ev'ryone give it up for America's favorite fighting Frenchman!

[COMPANY]
Lafayette!

[LAFAYETTE]
I'm takin this horse by the reins makin'
Redcoats redder with bloodstains

[COMPANY]
Lafayette!

[LAFAYETTE]
And I'm never gonna stop until I make ‘em
Drop and burn ‘em up and scatter their remains, I'm

[COMPANY]
Lafayette!

[LAFAYETTE]
Watch me engagin' em! Escapin' em!
Enragin' em! I'm-

[COMPANY]
Lafayette!

[LAFAYETTE]
I go to France for more funds

[COMPANY]
Lafayette!

[LAFAYETTE]
I come back with more

[LAFAYETTE AND ENSEMBLE]
Guns
And ships
And so the balance shifts

[WASHINGTON]
We rendezvous with Rochambeau, consolidate their gifts

[LAFAYETTE]
We can end this war at Yorktown, cut them off at sea, but
For this to succeed, there's someone else we need:

[WASHINGTON]
I know

[WASHINGTON AND COMPANY]
Hamilton!

[LAFAYETTE]
Sir, he knows what to do in a trench
Ingenuitive and fluent in French, ami-

[WASHINGTON AND COMPANY]
Hamilton!

[LAFAYETTE]
Sir, you're gonna have to use him eventually
What's he gonna do on the bench? I mean-

[WASHINGTON AND COMPANY]
Hamilton!

[LAFAYETTE]
No one has more resilience
Or matches my practical tactical brilliance-

[WASHINGTON AND COMPANY]
Hamilton!
[LAFAYETTE]
You wanna fight for your land back?

[WASHINGTON]

Oh, Alexander Hamilton
I have soldiers who will yield for you
If we manage to get this right
They'll surrender by early light
The world will never be the same, Alexander...

History Has Its Eyes On You

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[WASHINGTON]
I was younger than you are now
When I was given my first command
I led my men straight into a massacre
I witnessed their deaths firsthand
I made every mistake
I felt the shame rise in me
And even now I lie awake
[WASHINGTON]
Knowing history has its eyes on me

[HAMILTON/WASHINGTON]
History has its eyes on me. [LAURENS/MULLIGAN]
Whoa...
Whoa...
Whoa...
Yeah

[COMPANY]
Whoa...
Whoa...
Whoa...
Yeah

[WASHINGTON]
Let me tell you what I wish I'd known
When I was young and dreamed of glory:
You have no control:

[WASHINGTON AND COMPANY]
Who lives, who dies, who tells your story

[WASHINGTON]
I know that we can win
I know that greatness lies in you
But remember from here on in
[WASHINGTON/HAMILTON AND MEN]
History has its
Eyes on you.

[ENSEMBLE]
Whoa...
Whoa...
Whoa...

[FULL COMPANY]
History has its eyes on you

Yorktown (The World Turned Upside Down)

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[COMPANY]
The battle of Yorktown. 1781

[LAFAYETTE]
Monsieur Hamilton

[HAMILTON]
Monsieur Lafayette

[LAFAYETTE]
In command where you belong

[HAMILTON]
How you say, no sweat
We're finally on the field. We've had quite a run

[LAFAYETTE]
Immigrants:

[HAMILTON/LAFAYETTE]
We get the job done

[HAMILTON]
So what happens if we win?

[LAFAYETTE]
I go back to France
I bring freedom to my people if I'm given the chance

[HAMILTON]
We'll be with you when you do

[LAFAYETTE]
Go lead your men

[HAMILTON]
See you on the other side

[LAFAYETTE]
‘Til we meet again, let's go!

[ENSEMBLE]
I am not throwin' away my shot!
I am not throwin' away my shot!
Hey yo, I'm just like my country, I'm young
Scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwin' away my shot!
I am not throwin' away my shot!

[HAMILTON]
‘Til the world turns upside down...

[ENSEMBLE]
‘Til the world turns upside down!

[HAMILTON]
I imagine death so much it feels more like a memory
This is where it gets me: on my feet
The enemy ahead of me
If this is the end of me, at least I have a friend with me
Weapon in my hand, a command, and my men with me
Then I remember my Eliza's expecting me...
Not only that, my Eliza's expecting
We gotta go, gotta get the job done
Gotta start a new nation, gotta meet my son!
Take the bullets out your gun!

[ENSEMBLE]
What?

[HAMILTON]
The bullets out your gun!

[ENSEMBLE]
What?

[HAMILTON]
We move under cover and we move as one
Through the night, we have one shot to live another day
We cannot let a stray gunshot give us away
We will fight up close, seize the moment and stay in it
It's either that or meet the business end of a bayonet
The code word is ‘Rochambeau,' dig me?

[ENSEMBLE]
Rochambeau!

[HAMILTON]
You have your orders now, go, man, go!
And so the American experiment begins
With my friends all scattered to the winds
Laurens is in South Carolina, redefining brav'ry

[HAMILTON/LAURENS]
We'll never be free until we end slavery!

[HAMILTON]
When we finally drive the British away
Lafayette is there waiting-

[HAMILTON/LAFAYETTE]
In Chesapeake Bay!

[HAMILTON]
How did we know that this plan would work?
We had a spy on the inside. That's right

[HAMILTON/COMPANY]
Hercules Mulligan!

[MULLIGAN]
A tailor spyin' on the British government!
I take their measurements, information and then I smuggle it

[COMPANY]
Up

[MULLIGAN]
To my brother's revolutionary covenant
I'm runnin' with the Sons of Liberty and I am lovin' it!
See, that's what happens when you up against the ruffians
We in the shit now, somebody gotta shovel it!
Hercules Mulligan, I need no introduction
When you knock me down I get the fuck back up again!

[COMPANY]
Left! Right! Hold!
Go!
What! What! What!

[HAMILTON]
After a week of fighting, a young man in a red coat stands on a parapet

[LAFAYETTE]
We lower our guns as he frantically waves a white handkerchief

[MULLIGAN]
And just like that, it's over. We tend to our wounded, we count our dead

[LAURENS]
Black and white soldiers wonder alike if this really means freedom

[WASHINGTON]
Not. Yet

[HAMILTON]
We negotiate the terms of surrender
I see George Washington smile
We escort their men out of Yorktown
They stagger home single file
Tens of thousands of people flood the streets
There are screams and church bells ringing
And as our fallen foes retreat
I hear the drinking song they're singing...

[ALL MEN]
The world turned upside down

[FULL COMPANY]
The world turned upside down
The world turned upside down
The world turned upside down
Down
Down, down, down

[LAFAYETTE]
Freedom for America, freedom for France!

[COMPANY]
Down, down, down

[HAMILTON]
Gotta start a new nation
Gotta meet my son

[COMPANY]
Down, down, down

[MULLIGAN]
We won!

[LAFAYETTE]
We won!

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE/LAURENS]
We won!

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE/LAURENS/HAMILTON/WASHINGTON]
We won!

[COMPANY]
The world turned upside down!

What Comes Next

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[KING GEORGE]
They say
The price of my war's not a price that they're willing to pay
Insane
You cheat with the French, now I'm fighting with France and with Spain
I'm so blue
I thought that we'd made an arrangement
When you went away
You were mine to subdue
Well, even despite our estrangement, I've got
A small query for you:

What comes next?
You've been freed
Do you know how hard it is to lead?

You're on your own
Awesome. Wow
Do you have a clue what happens now?

Oceans rise
Empires fall
It's much harder when it's all your call

All alone, across the sea
When your people say they hate you, don't
Come crawling back to me

Da da da dat da dat da da da
Da ya da
Da da dat
Da da ya da...

You're on your own...

Dear Theodosia

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[BURR]
Dear Theodosia, what to say to you?
You have my eyes. You have your mother's name

When you came into the world, you cried and it broke my heart

I'm dedicating every day to you
Domestic life was never quite my style
When you smile, you knock me out, I fall apart
And I thought I was so smart

You will come of age with our young nation
We'll bleed and fight for you, we'll make it right for you
If we lay a strong enough foundation
We'll pass it on to you, we'll give the world to you
And you'll blow us all away...
Someday, someday
Yeah, you'll blow us all away
Someday, someday

[HAMILTON]
Oh Philip, when you smile I am undone
My son
Look at my son. Pride is not the word I'm looking for

There is so much more inside me now
Oh Philip, you outshine the morning sun
My son
When you smile, I fall apart
And I thought I was so smart
My father wasn't around

[BURR]
My father wasn't around
[HAMILTON]
I swear that
I'll be around for you.
[BURR]
I'll be around for you.

[HAMILTON]
I'll do whatever it takes

[BURR]
I'll make a million mistakes

[BURR/HAMILTON]
I'll make the world safe and sound for you...
...will come of age with our young nation
We'll bleed and fight for you, we'll make it right for you

If we lay a strong enough foundation
We'll pass it on to you, we'll give the world to you
And you'll blow us all away...
Someday, someday
Yeah, you'll blow us all away
Someday, someday

Non-Stop

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[BURR]
After the war I went back to New York

[HAMILTON]
A-After the war I went back to New York

[BURR]
I finished up my studies and I practiced law

[HAMILTON]
I practiced law, Burr worked next door
[BURR]
Even though we started at the very same time
Alexander Hamilton began to climb
How to account for his rise to the top?
Maaaaan, the man is
Non-stop!

[ENSEMBLE]
Non-stop!

[HAMILTON]
Gentlemen of the jury, I'm curious, bear with me
Are you aware that we're making hist'ry?
This is the first murder trial of our brand-new nation
[HAMILTON]
The liberty behind
Deliberation-

[ENSEMBLE]
Non-stop!

[HAMILTON]
I intend to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt
With my assistant counsel-

[BURR]
Co-counsel
Hamilton, sit down
Our client Levi Weeks is innocent. Call your first witness
That's all you had to say!

[HAMILTON]
Okay!
One more thing-

[BURR]
Why do you assume you're the smartest in the room?
Why do you assume you're the smartest in the room?
Why do you assume you're the smartest in the room?
Soon that attitude may be your doom!

[ENSEMBLE]
Awwww!

[BURR]
Why do you write like you're running out of time?
Write day and night like you're running out of time?
Ev'ry day you fight, like you're running out of time

Keep on fighting. In the meantime- [ENSEMBLE]
Why do you write like you're running out of time?

Ev'ry day you fight, like you're running out of time

Non-stop!

[HAMILTON]
Corruption's such an old song that we can sing along in harmony
And nowhere is it stronger than in Albany
This colony's economy's increasingly stalling and

[HAMILTON]
Honestly, that's why public service
Seems to be calling me.

[BURR AND ENSEMBLE]
He's just
Non-stop!

[HAMILTON]
I practiced the law, I practic'ly perfected it
I've seen injustice in the world and I've corrected it
Now for a strong central democracy
If not, then I'll be Socrates
[HAMILTON]
Throwing verbal rocks
At these mediocrities.

[ENSEMBLE]
Awww!

[BURR]
Hamilton, at the Constitutional Convention:

[HAMILTON]
I was chosen for the Constitutional Convention

[BURR]
There as a New York junior delegate:
[HAMILTON]
Now what I'm going to say may sound indelicate...

[BURR]
Goes and proposes his own form of government!

His own plan for a new form of government!

[COMPANY]
Awwww!

What?

What?

[BURR]
Talks for six hours! The convention is listless!

[ENSEMBLE MAN]
Bright young man...

[ANOTHER ENSEMBLE MAN]
Yo, who the f is this?

[BURR]
Why do you always say what you believe?
Why do you always say what you believe?
Ev'ry proclamation guarantees free ammunition for your enemies!

[BURR AND MEN]
Why do you write like it's
Going out of style?
Write day and night like it's
Going out of style?

[COMPANY]
Why do you always say what you believe?
Awww!

[ALL WOMEN]
Going out of style, hey!
Going out of style, hey!

[BURR AND COMPANY]
Ev'ry day you fight like it's
Going out of style
Do what you do

[BURR]
Alexander?

[HAMILTON]
Aaron Burr, sir

[BURR]
It's the middle of the night

[HAMILTON]
Can we confer, sir?

[BURR]
Is this a legal matter?

HAMILTON
Yes, and it's important to me

[BURR]
What do you need?

[HAMILTON]
Burr, you're a better lawyer than me

[BURR]
Okay

[HAMILTON]
I know I talk too much, I'm abrasive
You're incredible in court. You're succinct, persuasive
My client needs a strong defense. You're the solution

[BURR]
Who's your client?

[HAMILTON]
The new U.S. Constitution?

[BURR]
No

[HAMILTON]
Hear me out

[BURR]
No way!

[HAMILTON]
A series of essays, anonymously published
Defending the document to the public

[BURR]
No one will read it

[HAMILTON]
I disagree

[BURR]
And if it fails?

[HAMILTON]
Burr, that's why we need it

[BURR]
The constitution's a mess

[HAMILTON]
So it needs amendments

[BURR]
It's full of contradictions

[HAMILTON]
So is independence
We have to start somewhere

[BURR]
No. No way

[HAMILTON]
You're making a mistake

[BURR]
Good night

[HAMILTON]
Hey
What are you waiting for?
What do you stall for?

[BURR]
What?

[HAMILTON]
We won the war
What was it all for?
Do you support this constitution?

[BURR]
Of course

[HAMILTON]
Then defend it

[BURR]
And what if you're backing the wrong horse?

[HAMILTON]
Burr, we studied and we fought and we killed
For the notion of a nation we now get to build
For once in your life, take a stand with pride
I don't understand how you stand to the side

[BURR]
I'll keep all my plans
Close to my chest

I'll wait here and see
Which way the wind
Will blow
I'm taking my time
Watching the
Afterbirth of a nation
Watching the tension grow.

[ENSEMBLE]
Wait for it, wait for
It, wait...

Which way the wind
Will blow
I'm taking my time
Watching the
Afterbirth of a nation
Watching the tension grow.

[ANGELICA]
I am sailing off to London. I'm accompanied by someone
Who always pays
I have found a wealthy husband who will keep
Me in comfort for all my days
He is not a lot of fun, but there's no one who
Can match you for turn of phrase
My Alexander

[HAMILTON]
Angelica

[ANGELICA]
Don't forget to write

[ELIZA]
Look at where you are
Look at where you started
The fact that you're alive is a miracle
Just stay alive, that would be enough
And if your wife could share a fraction of your time
If I could grant you peace of mind
Would that be enough?

[BURR]
Alexander joins forces with James Madison and John Jay to write a series of essays defending the new United States Constitution, entitled The Federalist Papers. The plan was to write a total of twenty-five essays, the work divided evenly among the three men. In the end, they wrote eighty-five essays, in the span of six months. John Jay got sick after writing five. James Madison wrote twenty-nine. Hamilton wrote the other fifty-one!

[BURR]
How do you write like you're
Running out of time?
Write day and night like you're
Running out of time?

[BURR AND MEN]
Ev'ry day you fight
Like you're
Running out of time
Like you're
Running out of time
Are you
Running out of time?
[ALL WOMEN]
Running out of time?
Running out of time?
Running out of time
Running out of time
Awwww!

[FULL COMPANY (EXCEPT HAMILTON)]
How do you write like tomorrow won't arrive?
How do you write like you need it to survive?
How do you write ev'ry second you're alive?
Ev'ry second you're alive? Ev'ry second you're alive?

[WASHINGTON]
They are asking me to lead
I am doing the best I can
To get the people that I need
I'm asking you to be my right hand man

[HAMILTON]
Treasury or State?

[WASHINGTON]
I know it's a lot to ask

[HAMILTON]
Treasury or State?

[WASHINGTON]
To leave behind the world you know...

[HAMILTON]
Sir, do you want me to run the Treasury or State department?

[WASHINGTON]
Treasury

[HAMILTON]
Let's go

[ELIZA]

[HAMILTON]
I have to leave

Alexander-

[HAMILTON]
Look around, look around at how lucky we are to be alive right now

Look around, isn't this enough?

[ANGELICA]
He will never be satisfied
He will never be satisfied

He will never be satisfied

How does a bastard, orphan, son of a whore and a
Scotsman, dropped in the middle of a
Forgotten spot in the Caribbean by providence
Impoverished, in squalor
Grow up to be a hero and a scholar?

[LAURENS]
The ten-dollar founding father without a father
Got a lot farther by working a lot harder
By being a lot smarter
By being a self-starter
By fourteen, they placed him in charge of a
Trading charter

[JEFFERSON]
And every day while slaves were being slaughtered and carted
Away across the waves, he struggled and kept his guard up
Inside, he was longing for something to be a part of
The brother was ready to beg, steal, borrow, or barter

[MADISON]
Then a hurricane came, and devastation reigned
Our man saw his future drip, dripping down the drain
Put a pencil to his temple, connected it to his brain
And he wrote his first refrain, a testament to his pain

[BURR]
Well, the word got around, they said, "This kid is insane, man"
Took up a collection just to send him to the mainland
"Get your education, don't forget from whence you came, and
The world is gonna know your name. What's your name, man?"

[HAMILTON]
Alexander Hamilton
My name is Alexander Hamilton
And there's a million things I haven't done
But just you wait, just you wait...

[ELIZA]
When he was ten his father split, full of it, debt-ridden
Two years later, see Alex and his mother bed-ridden
Half-dead sittin in their own sick, the scent thick

[COMPANY]
And Alex got better but his mother went quick

[WASHINGTON]
Moved in with a cousin, the cousin committed suicide
Left him with nothin' but ruined pride, something new inside
A voice saying
[WASHINGTON]
"You gotta fend for yourself." [COMPANY]
"Alex, you gotta fend for yourself."

[WASHINGTON]
He started retreatin' and readin' every treatise on the shelf
[BURR]
There would have been nothin' left to do
For someone less astute
He woulda been dead or destitute
Without a cent of restitution
Started workin', clerkin' for his late mother's landlord
Tradin' sugar cane and rum and all the things he can't afford
Scammin' for every book he can get his hands on
Plannin' for the future see him now as he stands on
The bow of a ship headed for a new land
In New York you can be a new man

[COMPANY]
In New York you can
Be a new man-
In New York you can
Be a new man-

Plannin'
Oooh...

You could never back down
You never learned to take your time!

Oh, Alexander Hamilton

When America sings for you
Will they know what you overcame?
Will they know you rewrote the game?
The world will never be the same, oh

[BURR]
The ship is in the harbor now
See if you can spot him

Another immigrant
Comin' up from the bottom

His enemies destroyed his rep
America forgot him

Waiting in the wings for you

You never learned to take your time!

We fought with him

[LAURENS]
Me? I died for him

Aaron Burr, Sir

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[COMPANY]
1776. New York City

[HAMILTON]
Pardon me. Are you Aaron Burr, sir?

[BURR]
That depends. Who's asking?

[HAMILTON]
Oh, well, sure, sir
I'm Alexander Hamilton, I'm at your service, sir
I have been looking for you

[BURR]
I'm getting nervous

[HAMILTON]
Sir...
I heard your name at Princeton. I was seeking an accelerated course of study when I got sort of out of sorts with a buddy of yours. I may have punched him. It's a blur, sir. He handles the financials?

[BURR]
You punched the bursar

[HAMILTON]
Yes!
I wanted to do what you did. Graduate in two, then join the revolution. He looked at me like I was stupid, I'm not stupid

So how'd you do it? How'd you graduate so fast?

[BURR]
It was my parents' dying wish before they passed

[HAMILTON]
You're an orphan. Of course! I'm an orphan
God, I wish there was a war!
Then we could prove that we're worth more
Than anyone bargained for...

[BURR]
Can I buy you a drink?

[HAMILTON]
That would be nice

[BURR]
While we're talking, let me offer you some free advice
Talk less

[HAMILTON]
What?

[BURR]
Smile more

[HAMILTON]
Ha

[BURR]
Don't let them know what you're against or what you're for

[HAMILTON]
You can't be serious

[BURR]
You wanna get ahead?

[HAMILTON]
Yes

[BURR]
Fools who run their mouths off wind up dead

[LAURENS]
Yo yo yo yo yo!
What time is it?

[LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
Show time!

[BURR]
...like I said...

[LAURENS]
Show time! Show time! Yo!
I'm John Laurens in the place to be!
Two pints o' Sam Adams, but I'm workin' on three, uh!
Those redcoats don't want it with me!
Cuz I will pop chick-a pop these cops till I'm free!

[LAFAYETTE]
Oui oui, mon ami, je m'appelle Lafayette!
The Lancelot of the revolutionary set!
I came from afar just to say "Bonsoir!"
Tell the King "Casse toi!" Who's the best?
C'est moi!

[MULLIGAN]
Brrrah brraaah! I am Hercules Mulligan
Up in it, lovin' it, yes I heard ya mother said "Come again?"
Lock up ya daughters and horses, of course
It's hard to have intercourse over four sets of corsets...

[LAURENS]
No more sex, pour me another brew, son!
Let's raise a couple more...

[LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
To the revolution!

[LAURENS]
Well, if it ain't the prodigy of Princeton college!

[MULLIGAN]
Aaron Burr!

[LAURENS]
Give us a verse, drop some knowledge!

[BURR]
Good luck with that: you're takin' a stand
You spit. I'm ‘a sit. We'll see where we land

[LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
Boooo!

[LAURENS]
Burr, the revolution's imminent. What do you stall for?

[HAMILTON]
If you stand for nothing, Burr, what'll you fall for?
[LAURENS]
Ooh
Who are you? [MULLIGAN]
Ooh

Who are you? [LAFAYETTE]
Ooh

Who are you?

My Shot

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[HAMILTON]
I am not throwing away my shot!
I am not throwing away my shot!
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot!
I'm ‘a get a scholarship to King's College
I prob'ly shouldn't brag, but dag, I amaze and astonish
The problem is I got a lot of brains but no polish
I gotta holler just to be heard
With every word, I drop knowledge!
I'm a diamond in the rough, a shiny piece of coal
Tryin' to reach my goal. My power of speech: unimpeachable
Only nineteen but my mind is older
These New York City streets get colder, I shoulder
Ev'ry burden, ev'ry disadvantage
I have learned to manage, I don't have a gun to brandish
I walk these streets famished
The plan is to fan this spark into a flame
But damn, it's getting dark, so let me spell out the name
I am the-

[HAMILTON/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN/LAURENS]
A-L-E-X-A-N-D
E-R-we are-meant to be...

[HAMILTON]
A colony that runs independently
Meanwhile, Britain keeps shittin' on us endlessly
Essentially, they tax us relentlessly
Then King George turns around, runs a spending spree
He ain't ever gonna set his descendants free
So there will be a revolution in this century
Enter me!

[LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN/LAURENS]
(He says in parentheses)

[HAMILTON]
Don't be shocked when your hist'ry book mentions me
I will lay down my life if it sets us free
Eventually, you'll see my ascendancy
[HAMILTON]
And I am not throwing away
My shot
I am not throwing away
My shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot
[LAURENS]
My shot!

My shot!

And I'm not throwing away my shot.

[HAMILTON/MULLIGAN/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE]
I am not throwing away my shot
I am not throwing away my shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot
It's time to take a shot!

[LAFAYETTE]
I dream of life without a monarchy
The unrest in France will lead to ‘onarchy?
‘Onarchy? How you say, how you say, ‘anarchy?'
When I fight, I make the other side panicky
With my-

[HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
Shot!

[MULLIGAN]
Yo, I'm a tailor's apprentice
And I got y'all knuckleheads in loco parentis
I'm joining the rebellion cuz I know it's my chance
To socially advance, instead of sewin' some pants!
I'm gonna take a-

[HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
Shot!

[LAURENS]
But we'll never be truly free
Until those in bondage have the same rights as you and me
You and I. Do or die. Wait till I sally in
On a stallion with the first black battalion
Have another-

[HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
Shot!

[BURR]
Geniuses, lower your voices
You keep out of trouble and you double your choices
I'm with you, but the situation is fraught
You've got to be carefully taught:
If you talk, you're gonna get shot!

[HAMILTON]
Burr, check what we got
Mister Lafayette, hard rock like Lancelot
I think your pants look hot
Laurens, I like you a lot
Let's hatch a plot blacker than the kettle callin' the pot...
What are the odds the gods would put us all in one spot
Poppin' a squat on conventional wisdom, like it or not
A bunch of revolutionary manumission abolitionists?
Give me a position, show me where the ammunition is!

Oh, am I talkin' too loud?
Sometimes I get over excited, shoot off at the mouth
I never had a group of friends before
I promise that I'll make y'all proud

[LAURENS]
Let's get this guy in front of a crowd

[HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN/ENSEMBLE]
I am not throwing away my shot
I am not throwing away my shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot

I am not throwing away my shot
I am not throwing away my shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot
[LAURENS]
Ev'rybody sing:
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Hey!
Whoa!
Wooh!!
Whoa!
Ay, let ‘em hear ya!

Let's go!

I said shout it to the rooftops!

Tell your brother that he's gotta rise up

[HAMILTON]
I imagine death so much it feels more like a memory
When's it gonna get me?
In my sleep? Seven feet ahead of me?
If I see it comin', do I run or do I let it be?
Is it like a beat without a melody?
See, I never thought I'd live past twenty
Where I come from some get half as many
Ask anybody why we livin' fast and we laugh, reach for a flask
We have to make this moment last, that's plenty

Scratch that
This is not a moment, it's the movement
Where all the hungriest brothers with
Something to prove went?
Foes oppose us, we take an honest stand
We roll like Moses, claimin' our promised land
And? If we win our independence?
‘Zat a guarantee of freedom for our descendants?
Or will the blood we shed begin an endless
Cycle of vengeance and death with no defendants?
I know the action in the street is excitin'
But Jesus, between all the bleedin' ‘n fightin'
I've been readin' ‘n writin'
We need to handle our financial situation
Are we a nation of states? What's the state of our nation?
I'm past patiently waitin'. I'm passionately
Smashin' every expectation
Every action's an act of creation!
I'm laughin' in the face of casualties and sorrow
For the first time, I'm thinkin' past tomorrow

[HAMILTON AND COMPANY]
And I am not throwing away my shot
I am not throwing away my shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry

There's nothing rich folks love more
Than going downtown and slummin' it with the poor
They pull up in their carriages and gawk
At the students in the common
Just to watch them talk
Take Philip Schuyler: the man is loaded
Uh-oh, but little does he know that
His daughters, Peggy, Angelica, Eliza
Sneak into the city just to watch all the guys at-

Why you slummin' in the city in your fancy heels
You searchin for an urchin who can give you ideals?

[BURR]
Ah, so you've discussed me
I'm a trust fund, baby, you can trust me!

Farmer Refuted

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[SEABURY]
Hear ye, hear ye! My name is Samuel Seabury
And I present "Free Thoughts on the
Proceedings of the Continental Congress!"
Heed not the rabble who scream revolution
They have not your interests at heart

[MULLIGAN]
Oh my God. Tear this dude apart

[SEABURY]
Chaos and bloodshed are not a solution
Don't let them lead you astray
This Congress does not speak for me

[BURR]
Let him be

[SEABURY]
They're playing a dangerous game
I pray the king shows you his mercy
For shame, for shame...
[HAMILTON]
Yo!
He'd have you all unravel at the
Sound of screams but the
Revolution is comin'
The have-nots are gonna
Win this
It's hard to listen to you with a straight face

Chaos and bloodshed already haunt us, honestly you shouldn't even talk. And what about Boston? Look at the cost, n' all that we've lost n' you talk
About Congress?!

My dog speaks more eloquently than thee!

But strangely, your mange is the same

Is he in Jersey?

For the revolution!
[SEABURY]
Heed not the rabble
Who scream
Revolution, they
Have not your
Interests
At heart

Chaos and bloodshed are
Not a
Solution. Don't
Let them lead you
Astray
This Congress does not
Speak for me

They're playing a dangerous game

I pray the king shows you his mercy

For shame

For shame,

[COMPANY]
For the revolution!

[SEABURY]
Heed-

[HAMILTON]
If you repeat yourself again I'm gonna-

[SEABURY/HAMILTON]
Scream-

[HAMILTON]
Honestly, look at me, please don't read!

[SEABURY]
Not your interests-

[HAMILTON]
Don't modulate the key then not debate with me!
Why should a tiny island across the sea regulate the price of tea?

[BURR]
Alexander, please!

[HAMILTON]
Burr, I'd rather be divisive than indecisive, drop the niceties

Silence! A message from the King!

You'll Be Back

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[KING GEORGE]
You say
The price of my love's not a price that you're willing to pay
You cry
In your tea which you hurl in the sea when you see me go by
Why so sad?
Remember we made an arrangement when you went away
Now you're making me mad
Remember, despite our estrangement, I'm your man
You'll be back
Soon you'll see
You'll remember you belong to me
You'll be back
Time will tell
You'll remember that I served you well
Oceans rise
Empires fall
We have seen each other through it all
And when push
Comes to shove
I will send a fully armed battalion
To remind you of my love!

Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da
Da da dat dat da ya da!
Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da
Da da dat dat da...

You say our love is draining and you can't go on
You'll be the one complaining when I am gone...
And no, don't change the subject
Cuz you're my favorite subject
My sweet, submissive subject
My loyal, royal subject
Forever and ever and ever and ever and ever...

You'll be back
Like before
I will fight the fight and win the war
For your love
For your praise
And I'll love you till my dying days
When you're gone
I'll go mad
So don't throw away this thing we had

Cuz when push comes to shove
I will kill your friends and family to remind you of my love
Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da
Da da dat dat da ya da!
Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da
Da da dat-
Everybody!

[ENSEMBLE]
Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da
Da da dat dat da ya da!
Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da da da da

I knew that I was poor
I knew it was the only way to-

[HAMILTON/BURR/MULLIGAN/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE]

[HAMILTON]
If they tell my story
I am either gonna die on the battlefield in glory or-

[HAMILTON/BURR/MULLIGAN/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE]

We will fight for this land
But there's only one man
Who can give us a command so we can-

We gotta make an all out stand
Ayo, I'm gonna need a right-hand man.
ENSEMBLE
What?

What?

Buck, buck, buck, buck, buck!

Buck, buck, buck, buck, buck!

[WASHINGTON]
Check it-
Can I be real a second?
For just a millisecond?
Let down my guard and tell the people how I feel a second?
Now I'm the model of a modern major general
The venerated Virginian veteran whose men are all
Lining up, to put me up on a pedestal
Writin' letters to relatives
Embellishin' my elegance and eloquence
But the elephant is in the room
The truth is in ya face when ya hear the British cannons go...

[ENSEMBLE]
Boom!

[WASHINGTON]
Any hope of success is fleeting
How can I keep leading when the people I'm
Leading keep retreating?
We put a stop to the bleeding as the British take Brooklyn
Knight takes rook, but look
[WASHINGTON]
We are outgunned

Outmanned

Outnumbered
Outplanned

We gotta make an all out stand
Ayo, I'm gonna need a right-hand man

Incoming!

Buck, buck, buck, buck, buck!

We gotta stop ‘em and rob ‘em of their advantages

[MULLIGAN]

Let's take a stand with the stamina God has granted us
Hamilton won't abandon ship
Yo, let's steal their cannons-
[MULLIGAN]
Shh-boom! [COMPANY]

[WASHINGTON]
Goes the cannon, watch the blood and the shit spray and...

[COMPANY]
Boom!

[WASHINGTON]
Goes the cannon, we're abandonin' Kips Bay and...

[WASHINGTON]
There's another ship and...

[COMPANY]
Boom!

[WASHINGTON]
We just lost the southern tip and...

[COMPANY]
Boom!

[WASHINGTON]
We gotta run to Harlem quick, we can't afford another slip
Guns and horses giddyup
I decide to divvy up
My forces, they're skittish as the British cut the city up
This close to giving up, facing mad scrutiny
I scream in the face of this mass mutiny:
Are these the men with which I am to defend America?
We ride at midnight, Manhattan in the distance
I cannot be everywhere at once, people
I'm in dire need of assistance...

[BURR]
Your excellency, sir!

[WASHINGTON]
Who are you?

[BURR]
Aaron Burr, Sir?
Permission to state my case?

[WASHINGTON]
As you were

[BURR]
Sir
I was a captain under General Montgomery
Until he caught a bullet in the neck in Quebec
And well, in summary
I think that I could be of some assistance
I admire how you keep firing on the British
From a distance

[WASHINGTON]
Huh

[BURR]
I have some questions, a couple of suggestions on how to fight instead of fleeing west

[WASHINGTON]
Yes?

[BURR]
Well-

[HAMILTON]
Your excellency, you wanted to see me?

[WASHINGTON]
Hamilton, come in, have you met Burr?

[HAMILTON]
Yes, sir

[HAMILTON AND BURR]
We keep meeting

[BURR]
As I was saying, sir, I look forward to seeing your strategy play out

[WASHINGTON]
Burr?

[BURR]
Sir?

[WASHINGTON]
Close the door on your way out

[HAMILTON]
Have I done something wrong, sir?

[WASHINGTON]
On the contrary
I called you here because our odds are beyond scary
Your reputation precedes you, but I have to laugh

[HAMILTON]
Sir?

[WASHINGTON]
Hamilton, how come no one can get you on their staff?

[HAMILTON]
Sir!

[WASHINGTON]
Don't get me wrong, you're a young man, of great renown
I know you stole British cannons when we were still downtown
Nathaniel Green and Henry Knox wanted to hire you...

[HAMILTON]
To be their Secretary? I don't think so

[WASHINGTON]
Why're you upset?

[HAMILTON]
I'm not-

[WASHINGTON]
It's alright, you want to fight, you've got a hunger
I was just like you when I was younger
Head full of fantasies of dyin' like a martyr?

[HAMILTON]
Yes

[WASHINGTON]
Dying is easy, young man. Living is harder

[HAMILTON]
Why are you telling me this?

[WASHINGTON]
I'm being honest
I'm working with a third of what our Congress has promised
We are a powder keg about to explode
I need someone like you to lighten the load. So?

[COMPANY (EXCEPT HAMILTON)]
I am not throwin' away my shot!
I am not throwin' away my shot!
Ayo, I'm just like my country, I'm young
Scrappy and hungry!

[HAMILTON]
I am not throwing away my shot!

[WASHINGTON]

[WASHINGON AND COMPANY]
We are outgunned, outmanned!

[HAMILTON]
You need all the help you can get
I have some friends. Laurens, Mulligan
Marquis de Lafayette, okay, what else?

[WASHINGTON AND COMPANY]
Outnumbered, outplanned!

[HAMILTON]
We'll need some spies on the inside
Some King's men who might let some things slide
[HAMILTON]
I'll write to Congress and tell ‘em we need supplies, you rally the guys, master the element of surprise

I'll rise above my station, organize your information, ‘til we rise to the occasion of our new nation. Sir!

A Winter's Ball

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[BURR]
How does the bastard, orphan, son of a whore
Go on and on
Grow into more of a phenomenon?
Watch this obnoxious, arrogant, loudmouth bother
Be seated at the right hand of the father
Washington hires Hamilton right on sight
But Hamilton still wants to fight, not write
Now Hamilton's skill with a quill is undeniable
But what do we have in common? We're
Reliable with the

[ALL MEN]
Ladies!

[BURR]
There are so many to deflower!

[ALL MEN]
Ladies!

Helpless!
Look into your eyes, and the sky's the limit I'm helpless!
Down for the count, and I'm drownin' in ‘em

[ELIZA]
I have never been the type to try and grab the spotlight
We were at a revel with some rebels on a hot night
Laughin' at my sister as she's dazzling the room
Then you walked in and my heart went "Boom!"
Tryin' to catch your eye from the side of the ballroom
Everybody's dancin' and the band's top volume

[ELIZA AND WOMEN]
Grind to the rhythm as we wine and dine
[ELIZA]
Grab my sister, and
Whisper, "Yo, this
One's mine."

My sister made her way across the room to you
And I got nervous, thinking "What's she gonna do?"
She grabbed you by the arm, I'm thinkin' "I'm through"
Then you look back at me and suddenly I'm
Helpless!

Oh, look at those eyes

Oh!
Yeah, I'm
Helpless, I know

I'm so into you
I am so into you

I know I'm down for the count
And I'm drownin' in ‘em.

[HAMILTON]

[ANGELICA]
My sister

[ELIZA]
Thank you for all your service

[HAMILTON]
If it takes fighting a war for us to meet, it will have been worth it

[ANGELICA]
I'll leave you to it

[ELIZA AND WOMEN]
One week later

[ELIZA]
I'm writin' a letter nightly
Now my life gets better, every letter that you write me
Laughin' at my sister, cuz she wants to form a harem

[ANGELICA]
I'm just sayin', if you really loved me, you would share him
[ELIZA]
Ha!
Two weeks later
In the living room stressin'
My father's stone-faced
While you're asking for his blessin'
I'm dying inside, as
You wine
And dine
And I'm tryin' not to cry
‘cause there's nothing that your mind can't do
My father makes his way across the room
To you
I panic for a second, thinking
"we're through"
But then he shakes your hand and says
"Be true"
And you turn back to me, smiling, and I'm
Helpless!

Helpless!
Hoo!

That boy is mine
That boy is mine!

Helpless! Helpless!
Down for the count
And I'm drownin' in em

And I'm drownin' in em

[HAMILTON]
Eliza, I don't have a dollar to my name
An acre of land, a troop to command, a dollop of fame
All I have's my honor, a tolerance for pain
A couple of college credits and my top-notch brain
Insane, your family brings out a different side of me
Peggy confides in me, Angelica tried to take a bite of me
No stress, my love for you is never in doubt
We'll get a little place in Harlem and we'll figure it out
I've been livin' without a family since I was a child
My father left, my mother died, I grew up buckwild
But I'll never forget my mother's face, that was real
And long as I'm alive, Eliza, swear to God
You'll never feel so...

[HAMILTON]
Eliza...

I've never felt so-

My life is gon' be fine cuz Eliza's in it.
[ELIZA]
I do I do I do I do!

I do I do I do I do!

Hey, yeah, yeah!

I'm down for the count
I'm-

I look into your eyes, and the sky's the limit
I'm

...drownin' in ‘em. [ALL WOMEN]
Helpless!

Helpless!

Helpless!

Down for the count
And I'm drownin' in ‘em

Helpless!

Helpless!

Helpless!

Down for the count
And I'm drownin' in ‘em.

Wedding march plays

[ALL WOMEN]
In New York, you can be a new man...
In New York, you can be a new man...
In New York, you can be a new man...

Satisfied

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[LAURENS]
Alright, alright. That's what I'm talkin' about!
Now everyone give it up for the maid of honor
Angelica Schuyler!
[ANGELICA]
A toast to the groom!

To the bride!

From your sister

Who is always by your side

To your union

And the hope that you provide

May you always...

Be satisfied.

[ALL MEN]
To the groom!
To the groom!
To the groom!

To the bride!
To the bride!

Angelica!
Angelica!
Angelica!

By your side!

To the union!
To the revolution!

You provide!
You provide!

[HAMILTON AND MEN]
Always-

Rewind-

[ALL WOMEN]
To the groom!

To the bride!

To the bride!

[ELIZA AND WOMEN]
Angelica!

By your side!

To the union!
To the revolution!

You provide!

Always-

Rewind-

[ANGELICA]
I remember that night, I just might
Regret that night for the rest of my days

I remember those soldier boys
Tripping over themselves to win our praise

I remember that dreamlike candlelight
Like a dream that you can't quite place

But Alexander, I'll never forget the first
Time I saw your face

I have never been the same
Intelligent eyes in a hunger-pang frame
And when you said "Hi," I forgot my dang name
Set my heart aflame, ev'ry part aflame

[FULL COMPANY]
This is not a game...

[HAMILTON]
You strike me as a woman who has never been satisfied

[ANGELICA]
I'm sure I don't know what you mean. You forget yourself

[HAMILTON]
You're like me. I'm never satisfied

[ANGELICA]
Is that right?

[HAMILTON]
I have never been satisfied

[ANGELICA]
My name is Angelica Schuyler

[HAMILTON]
Alexander Hamilton

[ANGELICA]
Where's your fam'ly from?

[HAMILTON]
Unimportant. There's a million things I haven't done but
Just you wait, just you wait...

[ANGELICA]
So so so-
So this is what it feels like to match wits
With someone at your level! What the hell is the catch? It's
The feeling of freedom, of seein' the light
It's Ben Franklin with a key and a kite! You see it, right?
The conversation lasted two minutes, maybe three minutes
Ev'rything we said in total agreement, it's
A dream and it's a bit of a dance
A bit of a posture, it's a bit of a stance. He's a
Bit of a flirt, but I'm ‘a give it a chance
I asked about his fam'ly, did you see his answer?
His hands started fidgeting, he looked askance?
He's penniless, he's flying by the seat of his pants

Handsome, boy, does he know it!
Peach fuzz, and he can't even grow it!
I wanna take him far away from this place
Then I turn and see my sister's face and she is...

[ELIZA]
Helpless...

[ANGELICA]
And I know she is...

[ELIZA]
Helpless...

[ANGELICA]
And her eyes are just...

[ELIZA]
Helpless...

[ANGELICA]
And I realize

[ANGELICA AND COMPANY]
Three fundamental truths at the exact same time...

[HAMILTON]
Where are you taking me?

[ANGELICA]
I'm about to change your life

[HAMILTON]
Then by all means, lead the way

[COMPANY (EXCEPT ANGELICA)]
Number one!

[ANGELICA]
I'm a girl in a world in which
My only job is to marry rich
My father has no sons so I'm the one
Who has to social climb for one
So I'm the oldest and the wittiest and the gossip in
New York City is insidious
Alexander is penniless
Ha! That doesn't mean I want him any less

[ELIZA]
Elizabeth Schuyler. It's a pleasure to meet you

[HAMILTON]
Schuyler?

[ANGELICA]
My sister

[COMPANY]
Number two!

[ANGELICA]
He's after me cuz I'm a Schuyler sister
That elevates his status, I'd
Have to be naïve to set that aside
Maybe that is why I introduce him to Eliza
Now that's his bride
Nice going, Angelica, he was right
You will never be satisfied

[ELIZA]
Thank you for all your service

[HAMILTON]
If it takes fighting a war for us to meet, it will have been worth it

[ANGELICA]
I'll leave you to it

[COMPANY]
Number three!

[ANGELICA]
I know my sister like I know my own mind
You will never find anyone as trusting or as kind
If I tell her that I love him she'd be silently resigned
He'd be mine
She would say, "I'm fine"

[ANGELICA AND COMPANY]
She'd be lying

[ANGELICA]
But when I fantasize at night
It's Alexander's eyes
As I romanticize what might
Have been if I hadn't sized him
Up so quickly
At least my dear Eliza's his wife;
At least I keep his eyes in my life...
[ANGELICA]
To the groom!

To the bride!

From your sister

Who is always by your side

To your union

And the hope that you provide

May you always

Be satisfied

And I know

She'll be happy as

His bride
And I know [ALL MEN (EXCEPT HAMILTON)]
To the groom!
To the groom!
To the groom!

To the bride!
To the bride!

Angelica!
Angelica!

By your side

To the union!
To the revolution!

You provide!
You provide!

[HAMILTON AND MEN]
Always-

Be satisfied

Be satisfied

[MEN]
Be satisfied
Be satisfied
Be satisfied
Be satisfied

Be satisfied
Be satisfied

Be satisfied
Be satisfied
Be satisfied
Be satisfied.

[ALL WOMEN (EXCEPT ELIZA)]
To the groom!

To the bride!

To the bride!

[ELIZA AND WOMEN]
Angelica!

By your side

To the union!
To the revolution!

You provide!

Always-

Be satisfied

[WOMEN]
Be satisfied

Be satisfied

Be satisfied.

He will never be satisfied
I will never be satisfied

The Story of Tonight (Reprise)

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[LAURENS]
I may not live to see our glory!

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE]
I may not live to see our glory!

[LAURENS]
But I've seen wonders great and small

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE]
I've seen wonders great and small

[LAURENS]
‘Cause if the tomcat can get married

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE]
If Alexander can get married-

[LAURENS]
There's hope for our ass, after all!

[LAFAYETTE]
Raise a glass to freedom

[LAURENS/MULLIGAN]
Hey!
Something you will never see again!

[MULLIGAN]
No matter what she tells you

[LAFAYETTE]
Let's have another round tonight!

[LAURENS]
Raise a glass to the four of us!

[LAFAYETTE/HAMILTON]
Ho!

[MULLIGAN]
To the newly not poor of us!

[LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/HAMILTON]
Woo!

[LAFAYETTE]
We'll tell the story of tonight

[LAURENS]
Let's have another round-

[HAMILTON]
Well, if it isn't Aaron Burr

[BURR]
Sir!

[HAMILTON]
I didn't think that you would make it

[BURR]
To be sure

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE]
Burr!

[BURR]
I came to say congratulations

[MULLIGAN]
Spit a verse, Burr!

[BURR]
I see the whole gang is here

[LAFAYETTE]
You are the worst, Burr!

[HAMILTON]
Ignore them. Congrats to you, Lieutenant Colonel
I wish I had your command instead of manning George's journal

[BURR]
No, you don't

[HAMILTON]
Yes, I do

[BURR]
Now, be sensible
From what I hear, you've made yourself indispensable

[LAURENS]
Well, well, I heard
You've got a special someone on the side, Burr

[HAMILTON]
Is that so?

[LAURENS]
What are you tryin' to hide, Burr?

[BURR]
I should go

[HAMILTON]
No, these guys should go

[LAFAYETTE]
What?

[LAURENS]
No!

[HAMILTON]
Leave us alone

[MULLIGAN]
Man...

[HAMILTON]
It's alright, Burr. I wish you'd brought this girl with you tonight, Burr

[BURR]
You're very kind, but I'm afraid it's unlawful, sir

[HAMILTON]
What do you mean?

[BURR]
She's married

[HAMILTON]
I see

[BURR]
She's married to a British officer

[HAMILTON]
Oh shit...

[BURR]
Congrats again, Alexander. Smile more
I'll see you on the other side of the war

[HAMILTON]
I will never understand you
If you love this woman, go get her! What are you waiting for?

[BURR]
I'll see you on the other side of the war

[HAMILTON]
I'll see you on the other side of the war

Wait For It

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[BURR]
Theodosia writes me a letter everyday
I'm keeping the bed warm while her husband is away
He's on the British side in Georgia
He's trying to keep the colonies in line
But he can keep all of Georgia
Theodosia, she's mine

Love doesn't discriminate
Between the sinners
And the saints
It takes and it takes and it takes
And we keep loving anyway
We laugh and we cry
And we break
And we make our mistakes
And if there's a reason I'm by her side
When so many have tried
Then I'm willing to wait for it
I'm willing to wait for it
[BURR]
My grandfather was a fire and brimstone preacher

But there are things that the
Homilies and hymns won't teach ya

My mother was a genius

My father commanded respect

When they died they left no instructions
Just a legacy to protect

[MEN]
Preacher, preacher
Preacher

Teach ya, teach ya, teach ya

Respect, respect

[WOMEN]
Genius

[BURR/ENSEMBLE]
Death doesn't discriminate
Between the sinners
And the saints
It takes and it takes and it takes
And we keep living anyway
We rise and we fall
And we break
And we make our mistakes
And if there's a reason I'm still alive
When everyone who loves me has died
I'm willing to wait for it
I'm willing to wait for it

Wait for it

[ENSEMBLE]
Wait for it
Wait for it
Wait for it

[BURR]
I am the one thing in life I can control

[ENSEMBLE]
Wait for it

I am inimitable
I am an original

[ENSEMBLE]
Wait for it

[BURR]
I'm not falling behind or running late

[ENSEMBLE]
Wait for it
Wait for it

[BURR]
I'm not standing still
I am lying in wait

[ENSEMBLE]
Wait

[BURR]
Hamilton faces an endless uphill climb

[ENSEMBLE]
Climb
Climb
Climb

[BURR]
He has something to prove
He has nothing to lose

[ENSEMBLE]
Lose
Lose
Lose
Lose

[BURR]
Hamilton's pace is relentless
He wastes no time

[ENSEMBLE]
Time
Time
Time

[BURR]
What is it like in his shoes?

Hamilton doesn't hesitate
He exhibits no restraint
He takes and he takes and he takes
And he keeps winning anyway
He changes the game
He plays and he raises the stakes
And if there's a reason
He seems to thrive when so few survive, then Goddamnit-
[BURR]
I'm willing to wait for it

I'm willing to wait for it...

Life doesn't discriminate
Between the sinners and the saints
It takes and it takes and it takes

We rise
We fall

And if there's a reason I'm still alive
When so many have died
Then I'm willin' to-
[COMPANY]
I'm willing to wait for it
Wait for it

Life doesn't discriminate
Between the sinners and the saints
It takes and it takes and it takes
And we keep living anyway
We rise and we fall and we break

And if there's a reason I'm still alive
When so many have died

Stay Alive

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[ELIZA]
Stay alive...

[ELIZA/ANGELICA/ENSEMBLE WOMEN]
Stay alive...

[HAMILTON]
I have never seen the General so despondent
I have taken over writing all his correspondence
Congress writes, "George, attack the British forces."
I shoot back, we have resorted to eating our horses
Local merchants deny us equipment, assistance
They only take British money, so sing a song of sixpence

[WASHINGTON]
The cavalry's not coming

[HAMILTON]
Sir!

[WASHINGTON]
Alex, listen. There's only one way for us to win this
Provoke outrage, outright

[HAMILTON]
That's right

[WASHINGTON]
Don't engage, strike by night
Remain relentless ‘til their troops take flight

[HAMILTON]
Make it impossible to justify the cost of the fight

[WASHINGTON]
Outrun

[HAMILTON]
Outrun

[WASHINGTON]
Outlast

[HAMILTON]
Outlast

[WASHINGTON]
Hit ‘em quick, get out fast

[HAMILTON]
Chick-a-plao!

[WASHINGTON]
Stay alive ‘til this horror show is past
We're gonna fly a lot of flags half-mast

[HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE]
Raise a glass!

[MULLIGAN]
I go back to New York and my apprenticeship

[LAFAYETTE]
I ask for French aid, I pray that France has sent a ship

[LAURENS]
I stay at work with Hamilton
We write essays against slavery
And every day's a test of our camaraderie
And bravery

[HAMILTON]
We cut supply lines, we steal contraband
We pick and choose our battles and places to take a stand
And ev'ry day
"Sir, entrust me with a command,"
And ev'ry day

[WASHINGTON]
No

[HAMILTON]
He dismisses me out of hand
[HAMILTON]
Instead of me
He promotes
Charles Lee
Makes him second-in-command:

[LEE]
Charles Lee. [ELIZA/ANGELICA]
Stay alive...

[LEE]
I'm a General. Whee!!!!

[HAMILTON]
Yeah. He's not the choice I would have gone with

[HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE]
He shits the bed at the Battle of Monmouth

[WASHINGTON]
Ev'ryone attack!

[LEE]
Retreat!

[WASHINGTON]
Attack!

[LEE]
Retreat!

[WASHINGTON]
What are you doing, Lee? Get back on your feet!

[LEE]
But there's so many of them!

[WASHINGTON]
I'm sorry, is this not your speed?!
Hamilton!

[HAMILTON]
Ready, sir!

[WASHINGTON]
Have Lafayette take the lead!

[HAMILTON]
Yes, sir!

[LAURENS]
A thousand soldiers die in a hundred degree heat

[LAFAYETTE]
As we snatch a stalemate from the jaws of defeat

[HAMILTON]
Charles Lee was left behind
Without a pot to piss in
He started sayin' this to anybody who would listen:

[LEE]
Washington cannot be left alone to his devices
Indecisive, from crisis to crisis
The best thing he can do for the revolution
Is turn n' go back to plantin' tobacco in Mount Vernon

[COMPANY]
Oo!!

[WASHINGTON]
Don't do a thing. History will prove him wrong

[HAMILTON]
But, sir!

[WASHINGTON]
We have a war to fight, let's move along

[LAURENS]
Strong words from Lee, someone oughta hold him to it

[HAMILTON]
I can't disobey direct orders

[LAURENS]
Then I'll do it
Alexander, you're the closest friend I've got

[HAMILTON]
Laurens, do not throw away your shot

Ten Duel Commandments

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[MEN]
One, two, three, four

[FULL COMPANY]
Five, six, seven, eight, nine...

[BURR/HAMILTON/LAURENS/LEE]
It's the Ten Duel Commandments

[FULL COMPANY]
It's the Ten Duel Commandments
Number one!

[LAURENS]
The challenge: demand satisfaction
If they apologize, no need for further action

[COMPANY]
Number two!

[LAURENS]
If they don't, grab a friend, that's your second

[HAMILTON]
Your lieutenant when there's reckoning to be reckoned

[COMPANY]
Number three!

[LEE]
Have your seconds meet face to face

[BURR]
Negotiate a peace...

[HAMILTON]
Or negotiate a time and place

[BURR]
This is commonplace, ‘specially ‘tween recruits

[COMPANY]
Most disputes die, and no one shoots
Number four!

[LAURENS]
If they don't reach a peace, that's alright
Time to get some pistols and a doctor on site

[HAMILTON]
You pay him in advance, you treat him with civility

[BURR]
You have him turn around so he can have deniability

[COMPANY]
Five!

[LEE]
Duel before the sun is in the sky

[COMPANY]
Pick a place to die where it's high and dry
Number six!

[HAMILTON]
Leave a note for your next of kin
Tell ‘em where you been. Pray that hell or heaven lets you in

[COMPANY]
Seven!

[LEE]
Confess your sins. Ready for the moment of adrenaline when you finally face your opponent

[COMPANY]
Number eight!

[LAURENS/LEE/HAMILTON/BURR]
Your last chance to negotiate
Send in your seconds, see if they can set the record straight...

[BURR]
Alexander

[HAMILTON]
Aaron Burr, sir

[BURR]
Can we agree that duels are dumb and immature?

[HAMILTON]
Sure
But your man has to answer for his words, Burr

[BURR]
With his life? We both know that's absurd, sir

[HAMILTON]
Hang on, how many men died because Lee was inexperienced and ruinous?

[BURR]
Okay, so we're doin' this

[COMPANY]
Number nine!

[HAMILTON]
Look ‘em in the eye, aim no higher
Summon all the courage you require
Then count

[MEN]
One two three four

[FULL COMPANY]
Five six seven eight nine

[HAMILTON/BURR]
Number

[COMPANY]
Ten paces!

[HAMILTON/BURR]
Fire!

Meet Me Inside

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[HAMILTON]
Lee, do you yield?

[BURR]
You shot him in the side!
Yes, he yields!

[LAURENS]
I'm satisfied

[BURR]
Yo, we gotta clear the field!

[HAMILTON]
Go! We won

[COMPANY]
Here comes the General!

[BURR]
This should be fun

[WASHINGTON]
What is the meaning of this? Mr. Burr, get a medic for the General

[BURR]
Yes, sir

[WASHINGTON]
Lee, you will never agree with me
But believe me, these young men don't speak for me
Thank you for your service

[BURR]
Let's ride!

[WASHINGTON]
Hamilton!

[HAMILTON]
Sir!

[WASHINGTON]
Meet me inside

[COMPANY]
Meet him inside! Meet him inside!
Meet him inside, meet him, meet him inside!

[WASHINGTON]
Son-

[HAMILTON]
Don't call me son

[WASHINGTON]
This war is hard enough
Without infighting-

[HAMILTON]
Lee called you out. We called his bluff

[WASHINGTON]
You solve nothing, you aggravate our allies to the south

[HAMILTON]
You're absolutely right, John should have shot him in the mouth
That would've shut him up

[WASHINGTON]
Son-

[HAMILTON]
I'm notcha son-

[WASHINGTON]
Watch your tone
I am not a maiden in need of defending, I am grown

[HAMILTON (OVERLAPPING)]
Charles Lee, Thomas Conway
These men take your name and they rake it
Through the mud

[WASHINGTON]
My name's been through a lot, I can take it

[HAMILTON]
Well, I don't have your name. I don't have your titles
I don't have your land
But, if you-

[WASHINGTON]
No-

[HAMILTON]
If you gave me command of a battalion, a group of men to lead, I could fly above my station after the war

[WASHINGTON]
Or you could die and we need you alive

[HAMILTON]
I'm more than willing to die-

[WASHINGTON]
Your wife needs you alive, son, I need you alive-

[HAMILTON]
Call me son one more time-

[WASHINGTON]
Go home, Alexander
That's an order from your commander

[HAMILTON]
Sir-

[WASHINGTON]
Go home

That Would Be Enough

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[ELIZA]
Look around, look around at how lucky we are
To be alive right now
Look around, look around...

[HAMILTON]
How long have you known?

[ELIZA]
A month or so

[HAMILTON]
Eliza, you should have told me

[ELIZA]
I wrote to the General a month ago

[HAMILTON]
No

[ELIZA]
I begged him to send you home

[HAMILTON]
You should have told me

[ELIZA]
I'm not sorry
[ELIZA]
I knew you'd fight
Until the war was won

But you deserve a chance to meet your son
Look around, look around at how lucky we are
To be alive right now.
[HAMILTON]
The war's not
Done.

[HAMILTON]
Will you relish being a poor man's wife
Unable to provide for your life?

[ELIZA]
I relish being your wife
Look around, look around...

Look at where you are
Look at where you started
The fact that you're alive is a miracle
Just stay alive, that would be enough

And if this child
Shares a fraction of your smile
Or a fragment of your mind, look out world!
That would be enough

I don't pretend to know
The challenges you're facing
The worlds you keep erasing and creating in your mind

But I'm not afraid
I know who I married
So long as you come home at the end of the day
That would be enough

We don't need a legacy
We don't need money
If I could grant you peace of mind

If you could let me inside your heart...
Oh, let me be a part of the narrative
In the story they will write someday
Let this moment be the first chapter:
Where you decide to stay
And I could be enough
And we could be enough
That would be enough

Guns and Ships

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[BURR]
How does a ragtag volunteer army in need of a shower
Somehow defeat a global superpower?
How do we emerge victorious from the quagmire?
Leave the battlefield waving Betsy Ross' flag higher?
Yo. Turns out we have a secret weapon!
An immigrant you know and love who's unafraid to step in!
He's constantly confusin', confoundin' the British henchmen
Ev'ryone give it up for America's favorite fighting Frenchman!

[COMPANY]
Lafayette!

[LAFAYETTE]
I'm takin this horse by the reins makin'
Redcoats redder with bloodstains

[COMPANY]
Lafayette!

[LAFAYETTE]
And I'm never gonna stop until I make ‘em
Drop and burn ‘em up and scatter their remains, I'm

[COMPANY]
Lafayette!

[LAFAYETTE]
Watch me engagin' em! Escapin' em!
Enragin' em! I'm-

[COMPANY]
Lafayette!

[LAFAYETTE]
I go to France for more funds

[COMPANY]
Lafayette!

[LAFAYETTE]
I come back with more

[LAFAYETTE AND ENSEMBLE]
Guns
And ships
And so the balance shifts

[WASHINGTON]
We rendezvous with Rochambeau, consolidate their gifts

[LAFAYETTE]
We can end this war at Yorktown, cut them off at sea, but
For this to succeed, there's someone else we need:

[WASHINGTON]
I know

[WASHINGTON AND COMPANY]
Hamilton!

[LAFAYETTE]
Sir, he knows what to do in a trench
Ingenuitive and fluent in French, ami-

[WASHINGTON AND COMPANY]
Hamilton!

[LAFAYETTE]
Sir, you're gonna have to use him eventually
What's he gonna do on the bench? I mean-

[WASHINGTON AND COMPANY]
Hamilton!

[LAFAYETTE]
No one has more resilience
Or matches my practical tactical brilliance-

[WASHINGTON AND COMPANY]
Hamilton!
[LAFAYETTE]
You wanna fight for your land back?

[WASHINGTON]
I need my right hand man back!

[LAFAYETTE]
Ah! Uh, get ya right hand man back
You know you gotta get ya right hand man back

I mean you gotta put some thought into the letter but the sooner the better
To get your right hand man back!

[COMPANY]
Hamilton!

[WOMEN]
Hamilton!

Hamilton!

Hamilton, Hamilton!
Ha- ha-!

[MEN]
Get your right hand man back!

Your right hand man back!

Hamilton!
Ha-
Ha-

Hamilton, Hamilton!
Ha- ha-!

[WASHINGTON]
Alexander Hamilton
Troops are waiting in the field for you
If you join us right now, together we can turn the tide
Oh, Alexander Hamilton
I have soldiers who will yield for you
If we manage to get this right
They'll surrender by early light
The world will never be the same, Alexander...

History Has Its Eyes On You

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[WASHINGTON]
I was younger than you are now
When I was given my first command
I led my men straight into a massacre
I witnessed their deaths firsthand
I made every mistake
I felt the shame rise in me
And even now I lie awake
[WASHINGTON]
Knowing history has its eyes on me

[HAMILTON/WASHINGTON]
History has its eyes on me. [LAURENS/MULLIGAN]
Whoa...
Whoa...
Whoa...
Yeah

[COMPANY]
Whoa...
Whoa...
Whoa...
Yeah

[WASHINGTON]
Let me tell you what I wish I'd known
When I was young and dreamed of glory:
You have no control:

[WASHINGTON AND COMPANY]
Who lives, who dies, who tells your story

[WASHINGTON]
I know that we can win
I know that greatness lies in you
But remember from here on in
[WASHINGTON/HAMILTON AND MEN]
History has its
Eyes on you.

Yorktown (The World Turned Upside Down)

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[COMPANY]
The battle of Yorktown. 1781

[LAFAYETTE]
Monsieur Hamilton

[HAMILTON]
Monsieur Lafayette

[LAFAYETTE]
In command where you belong

[HAMILTON]
How you say, no sweat
We're finally on the field. We've had quite a run

[LAFAYETTE]
Immigrants:

[HAMILTON/LAFAYETTE]
We get the job done

[HAMILTON]
So what happens if we win?

[LAFAYETTE]
I go back to France
I bring freedom to my people if I'm given the chance

[HAMILTON]
We'll be with you when you do

[LAFAYETTE]
Go lead your men

[HAMILTON]
See you on the other side

[LAFAYETTE]
‘Til we meet again, let's go!

[ENSEMBLE]
I am not throwin' away my shot!
I am not throwin' away my shot!
Hey yo, I'm just like my country, I'm young
Scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwin' away my shot!
I am not throwin' away my shot!

[HAMILTON]
‘Til the world turns upside down...

[ENSEMBLE]
‘Til the world turns upside down!

[HAMILTON]
I imagine death so much it feels more like a memory
This is where it gets me: on my feet
The enemy ahead of me
If this is the end of me, at least I have a friend with me
Weapon in my hand, a command, and my men with me
Then I remember my Eliza's expecting me...
Not only that, my Eliza's expecting
We gotta go, gotta get the job done
Gotta start a new nation, gotta meet my son!
Take the bullets out your gun!

[ENSEMBLE]
What?

[HAMILTON]
The bullets out your gun!

[ENSEMBLE]
What?

[HAMILTON]
We move under cover and we move as one
Through the night, we have one shot to live another day
We cannot let a stray gunshot give us away
We will fight up close, seize the moment and stay in it
It's either that or meet the business end of a bayonet
The code word is ‘Rochambeau,' dig me?

[ENSEMBLE]
Rochambeau!

[HAMILTON]
You have your orders now, go, man, go!
And so the American experiment begins
With my friends all scattered to the winds
Laurens is in South Carolina, redefining brav'ry

[HAMILTON/LAURENS]
We'll never be free until we end slavery!

[HAMILTON]
When we finally drive the British away
Lafayette is there waiting-

[HAMILTON/LAFAYETTE]
In Chesapeake Bay!

[HAMILTON]
How did we know that this plan would work?
We had a spy on the inside. That's right

[HAMILTON/COMPANY]
Hercules Mulligan!

[MULLIGAN]
A tailor spyin' on the British government!
I take their measurements, information and then I smuggle it

[COMPANY]
Up

[MULLIGAN]
To my brother's revolutionary covenant
I'm runnin' with the Sons of Liberty and I am lovin' it!
See, that's what happens when you up against the ruffians
We in the shit now, somebody gotta shovel it!
Hercules Mulligan, I need no introduction
When you knock me down I get the fuck back up again!

[COMPANY]
Left! Right! Hold!
Go!
What! What! What!

[HAMILTON]
After a week of fighting, a young man in a red coat stands on a parapet

[LAFAYETTE]
We lower our guns as he frantically waves a white handkerchief

[MULLIGAN]
And just like that, it's over. We tend to our wounded, we count our dead

[LAURENS]
Black and white soldiers wonder alike if this really means freedom

[WASHINGTON]
Not. Yet

[HAMILTON]
We negotiate the terms of surrender
I see George Washington smile
We escort their men out of Yorktown
They stagger home single file
Tens of thousands of people flood the streets
There are screams and church bells ringing
And as our fallen foes retreat
I hear the drinking song they're singing...

[ALL MEN]
The world turned upside down

[FULL COMPANY]
The world turned upside down
The world turned upside down
The world turned upside down
Down
Down, down, down

[LAFAYETTE]
Freedom for America, freedom for France!

[COMPANY]
Down, down, down

[HAMILTON]
Gotta start a new nation
Gotta meet my son

[COMPANY]
Down, down, down

[MULLIGAN]
We won!

[LAFAYETTE]
We won!

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE/LAURENS]
We won!

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE/LAURENS/HAMILTON/WASHINGTON]
We won!

[COMPANY]
The world turned upside down!

What Comes Next

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[KING GEORGE]
They say
The price of my war's not a price that they're willing to pay
Insane
You cheat with the French, now I'm fighting with France and with Spain
I'm so blue
I thought that we'd made an arrangement
When you went away
You were mine to subdue
Well, even despite our estrangement, I've got
A small query for you:

What comes next?
You've been freed
Do you know how hard it is to lead?

You're on your own
Awesome. Wow
Do you have a clue what happens now?

Oceans rise
Empires fall
It's much harder when it's all your call

All alone, across the sea
When your people say they hate you, don't
Come crawling back to me

Da da da dat da dat da da da
Da ya da
Da da dat
Da da ya da...

You're on your own...

Dear Theodosia

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[BURR]
Dear Theodosia, what to say to you?
You have my eyes. You have your mother's name

When you came into the world, you cried and it broke my heart

I'm dedicating every day to you
Domestic life was never quite my style
When you smile, you knock me out, I fall apart
And I thought I was so smart

You will come of age with our young nation
We'll bleed and fight for you, we'll make it right for you
If we lay a strong enough foundation
We'll pass it on to you, we'll give the world to you
And you'll blow us all away...
Someday, someday
Yeah, you'll blow us all away
Someday, someday

[HAMILTON]
Oh Philip, when you smile I am undone
My son
Look at my son. Pride is not the word I'm looking for

There is so much more inside me now
Oh Philip, you outshine the morning sun
My son
When you smile, I fall apart
And I thought I was so smart
My father wasn't around

[BURR]
My father wasn't around
[HAMILTON]
I swear that
I'll be around for you.
[BURR]
I'll be around for you.

[HAMILTON]
I'll do whatever it takes

[BURR]
I'll make a million mistakes

[BURR/HAMILTON]
I'll make the world safe and sound for you...
...will come of age with our young nation
We'll bleed and fight for you, we'll make it right for you

If we lay a strong enough foundation
We'll pass it on to you, we'll give the world to you
And you'll blow us all away...
Someday, someday
Yeah, you'll blow us all away
Someday, someday

Non-Stop

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[BURR]
After the war I went back to New York

[HAMILTON]
A-After the war I went back to New York

[BURR]
I finished up my studies and I practiced law

[HAMILTON]
I practiced law, Burr worked next door
[BURR]
Even though we started at the very same time
Alexander Hamilton began to climb
How to account for his rise to the top?
Maaaaan, the man is
Non-stop!

[ENSEMBLE]
Non-stop!

[HAMILTON]
Gentlemen of the jury, I'm curious, bear with me
Are you aware that we're making hist'ry?
This is the first murder trial of our brand-new nation
[HAMILTON]
The liberty behind
Deliberation-

[ENSEMBLE]
Non-stop!

[HAMILTON]
I intend to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt
With my assistant counsel-

[BURR]
Co-counsel
Hamilton, sit down
Our client Levi Weeks is innocent. Call your first witness
That's all you had to say!

[HAMILTON]
Okay!
One more thing-

[BURR]
Why do you assume you're the smartest in the room?
Why do you assume you're the smartest in the room?
Why do you assume you're the smartest in the room?
Soon that attitude may be your doom!

[ENSEMBLE]
Awwww!

[BURR]
Why do you write like you're running out of time?
Write day and night like you're running out of time?
Ev'ry day you fight, like you're running out of time

Keep on fighting. In the meantime- [ENSEMBLE]
Why do you write like you're running out of time?

Ev'ry day you fight, like you're running out of time

Non-stop!

[HAMILTON]
Corruption's such an old song that we can sing along in harmony
And nowhere is it stronger than in Albany
This colony's economy's increasingly stalling and

[HAMILTON]
Honestly, that's why public service
Seems to be calling me.

[BURR AND ENSEMBLE]
He's just
Non-stop!

[HAMILTON]
I practiced the law, I practic'ly perfected it
I've seen injustice in the world and I've corrected it
Now for a strong central democracy
If not, then I'll be Socrates
[HAMILTON]
Throwing verbal rocks
At these mediocrities.

[ENSEMBLE]
Awww!

[BURR]
Hamilton, at the Constitutional Convention:

[HAMILTON]
I was chosen for the Constitutional Convention

[BURR]
There as a New York junior delegate:
[HAMILTON]
Now what I'm going to say may sound indelicate...

[BURR]
Goes and proposes his own form of government!

His own plan for a new form of government!

[COMPANY]
Awwww!

What?

What?

[BURR]
Talks for six hours! The convention is listless!

[ENSEMBLE MAN]
Bright young man...

[ANOTHER ENSEMBLE MAN]
Yo, who the f is this?

[BURR]
Why do you always say what you believe?
Why do you always say what you believe?
Ev'ry proclamation guarantees free ammunition for your enemies!

[BURR AND MEN]
Why do you write like it's
Going out of style?
Write day and night like it's
Going out of style?

[COMPANY]
Why do you always say what you believe?
Awww!

[ALL WOMEN]
Going out of style, hey!
Going out of style, hey!

[BURR AND COMPANY]
Ev'ry day you fight like it's
Going out of style
Do what you do

[BURR]
Alexander?

[HAMILTON]
Aaron Burr, sir

[BURR]
It's the middle of the night

[HAMILTON]
Can we confer, sir?

[BURR]
Is this a legal matter?

HAMILTON
Yes, and it's important to me

[BURR]
What do you need?

[HAMILTON]
Burr, you're a better lawyer than me

[BURR]
Okay

[HAMILTON]
I know I talk too much, I'm abrasive
You're incredible in court. You're succinct, persuasive
My client needs a strong defense. You're the solution

[BURR]
Who's your client?

[HAMILTON]
The new U.S. Constitution?

[BURR]
No

[HAMILTON]
Hear me out

[BURR]
No way!

[HAMILTON]
A series of essays, anonymously published
Defending the document to the public

[BURR]
No one will read it

[HAMILTON]
I disagree

[BURR]
And if it fails?

[HAMILTON]
Burr, that's why we need it

[BURR]
The constitution's a mess

[HAMILTON]
So it needs amendments

[BURR]
It's full of contradictions

[HAMILTON]
So is independence
We have to start somewhere

[BURR]
No. No way

[HAMILTON]
You're making a mistake

[BURR]
Good night

[HAMILTON]
Hey
What are you waiting for?
What do you stall for?

[BURR]
What?

[HAMILTON]
We won the war
What was it all for?
Do you support this constitution?

[BURR]
Of course

[HAMILTON]
Then defend it

[BURR]
And what if you're backing the wrong horse?

[HAMILTON]
Burr, we studied and we fought and we killed
For the notion of a nation we now get to build
For once in your life, take a stand with pride
I don't understand how you stand to the side

[BURR]
I'll keep all my plans
Close to my chest

I'll wait here and see
Which way the wind
Will blow
I'm taking my time
Watching the
Afterbirth of a nation
Watching the tension grow.

[ENSEMBLE]
Wait for it, wait for
It, wait...

Which way the wind
Will blow
I'm taking my time
Watching the
Afterbirth of a nation
Watching the tension grow.

[ANGELICA]
I am sailing off to London. I'm accompanied by someone
Who always pays
I have found a wealthy husband who will keep
Me in comfort for all my days
He is not a lot of fun, but there's no one who
Can match you for turn of phrase
My Alexander

[HAMILTON]
Angelica

[ANGELICA]
Don't forget to write

[ELIZA]
Look at where you are
Look at where you started
The fact that you're alive is a miracle
Just stay alive, that would be enough
And if your wife could share a fraction of your time
If I could grant you peace of mind
Would that be enough?

[BURR]
Alexander joins forces with James Madison and John Jay to write a series of essays defending the new United States Constitution, entitled The Federalist Papers. The plan was to write a total of twenty-five essays, the work divided evenly among the three men. In the end, they wrote eighty-five essays, in the span of six months. John Jay got sick after writing five. James Madison wrote twenty-nine. Hamilton wrote the other fifty-one!

[BURR]
How do you write like you're
Running out of time?
Write day and night like you're
Running out of time?

[BURR AND MEN]
Ev'ry day you fight
Like you're
Running out of time
Like you're
Running out of time
Are you
Running out of time?
[ALL WOMEN]
Running out of time?
Running out of time?
Running out of time
Running out of time
Awwww!

[FULL COMPANY (EXCEPT HAMILTON)]
How do you write like tomorrow won't arrive?
How do you write like you need it to survive?
How do you write ev'ry second you're alive?
Ev'ry second you're alive? Ev'ry second you're alive?

[WASHINGTON]
They are asking me to lead
I am doing the best I can
To get the people that I need
I'm asking you to be my right hand man

[HAMILTON]
Treasury or State?

[WASHINGTON]
I know it's a lot to ask

[HAMILTON]
Treasury or State?

[WASHINGTON]
To leave behind the world you know...

[HAMILTON]
Sir, do you want me to run the Treasury or State department?

[WASHINGTON]
Treasury

[HAMILTON]
Let's go

[ELIZA]
Alexander...

[HAMILTON]
I have to leave

[ELIZA]
Alexander-

[HAMILTON]
Look around, look around at how lucky we are to be alive right now

[ELIZA]
Helpless...

[HAMILTON]
They are asking me to lead

[ELIZA]
Look around, isn't this enough?

[ANGELICA]
He will never be satisfied
He will never be satisfied
Satisfied
Satisfied...
He will never be satisfied
Satisfied[BURR]
How does a bastard, orphan, son of a whore and a
Scotsman, dropped in the middle of a
Forgotten spot in the Caribbean by providence
Impoverished, in squalor
Grow up to be a hero and a scholar?

[LAURENS]
The ten-dollar founding father without a father
Got a lot farther by working a lot harder
By being a lot smarter
By being a self-starter
By fourteen, they placed him in charge of a
Trading charter

[JEFFERSON]
And every day while slaves were being slaughtered and carted
Away across the waves, he struggled and kept his guard up
Inside, he was longing for something to be a part of
The brother was ready to beg, steal, borrow, or barter

[MADISON]
Then a hurricane came, and devastation reigned
Our man saw his future drip, dripping down the drain
Put a pencil to his temple, connected it to his brain
And he wrote his first refrain, a testament to his pain

[BURR]
Well, the word got around, they said, "This kid is insane, man"
Took up a collection just to send him to the mainland
"Get your education, don't forget from whence you came, and
The world is gonna know your name. What's your name, man?"

[HAMILTON]
Alexander Hamilton
My name is Alexander Hamilton
And there's a million things I haven't done
But just you wait, just you wait...

[ELIZA]
When he was ten his father split, full of it, debt-ridden
Two years later, see Alex and his mother bed-ridden
Half-dead sittin in their own sick, the scent thick

[COMPANY]
And Alex got better but his mother went quick

[WASHINGTON]
Moved in with a cousin, the cousin committed suicide
Left him with nothin' but ruined pride, something new inside
A voice saying
[WASHINGTON]
"You gotta fend for yourself." [COMPANY]
"Alex, you gotta fend for yourself."

[WASHINGTON]
He started retreatin' and readin' every treatise on the shelf
[BURR]
There would have been nothin' left to do
For someone less astute
He woulda been dead or destitute
Without a cent of restitution
Started workin', clerkin' for his late mother's landlord
Tradin' sugar cane and rum and all the things he can't afford
Scammin' for every book he can get his hands on
Plannin' for the future see him now as he stands on
The bow of a ship headed for a new land
In New York you can be a new man

[COMPANY]
In New York you can
Be a new man-
In New York you can
Be a new man-

[COMPANY]
Scammin'

Plannin'
Oooh...

[HAMILTON]
Just you wait!

Just you wait!

[COMPANY]
In New York you can be a new man-

[WOMEN]
In New York-

[MEN]
New York-

[HAMILTON]
Just you wait!
[COMPANY]
Alexander Hamilton

We are waiting in the wings for you

You could never back down
You never learned to take your time!

Oh, Alexander Hamilton

When America sings for you
Will they know what you overcame?
Will they know you rewrote the game?
The world will never be the same, oh

[BURR]
The ship is in the harbor now
See if you can spot him

Another immigrant
Comin' up from the bottom

His enemies destroyed his rep
America forgot him
[COMPANY]
Alexander Hamilton

Waiting in the wings for you

You never learned to take your time!

Oh, Alexander Hamilton
Alexander Hamilton...
America sings for you
Will they know what you overcame?
Will they know you rewrote the game?
The world will never be the same, oh

[MEN]
Just you wait

[COMPANY]
Just you wait

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE]
We fought with him

[LAURENS]
Me? I died for him

[WASHINGTON]
Me? I trusted him

[ELIZA/ANGELICA/MARIA]
Me? I loved him

[BURR]
And me? I'm the damn fool that shot him

[COMPANY]
There's a million things I haven't done
But just you wait!

[BURR]
What's your name, man?

[COMPANY]
Alexander Hamilton!

Aaron Burr, Sir

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[COMPANY]
1776. New York City

[HAMILTON]
Pardon me. Are you Aaron Burr, sir?

[BURR]
That depends. Who's asking?

[HAMILTON]
Oh, well, sure, sir
I'm Alexander Hamilton, I'm at your service, sir
I have been looking for you

[BURR]
I'm getting nervous

[HAMILTON]
Sir...
I heard your name at Princeton. I was seeking an accelerated course of study when I got sort of out of sorts with a buddy of yours. I may have punched him. It's a blur, sir. He handles the financials?

[BURR]
You punched the bursar

[HAMILTON]
Yes!
I wanted to do what you did. Graduate in two, then join the revolution. He looked at me like I was stupid, I'm not stupid

So how'd you do it? How'd you graduate so fast?

[BURR]
It was my parents' dying wish before they passed

[HAMILTON]
You're an orphan. Of course! I'm an orphan
God, I wish there was a war!
Then we could prove that we're worth more
Than anyone bargained for...

[BURR]
Can I buy you a drink?

[HAMILTON]
That would be nice

[BURR]
While we're talking, let me offer you some free advice
Talk less

[HAMILTON]
What?

[BURR]
Smile more

[HAMILTON]
Ha

[BURR]
Don't let them know what you're against or what you're for

[HAMILTON]
You can't be serious

[BURR]
You wanna get ahead?

[HAMILTON]
Yes

[BURR]
Fools who run their mouths off wind up dead

[LAURENS]
Yo yo yo yo yo!
What time is it?

[LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
Show time!

[BURR]
...like I said...

[LAURENS]
Show time! Show time! Yo!
I'm John Laurens in the place to be!
Two pints o' Sam Adams, but I'm workin' on three, uh!
Those redcoats don't want it with me!
Cuz I will pop chick-a pop these cops till I'm free!

[LAFAYETTE]
Oui oui, mon ami, je m'appelle Lafayette!
The Lancelot of the revolutionary set!
I came from afar just to say "Bonsoir!"
Tell the King "Casse toi!" Who's the best?
C'est moi!

[MULLIGAN]
Brrrah brraaah! I am Hercules Mulligan
Up in it, lovin' it, yes I heard ya mother said "Come again?"
Lock up ya daughters and horses, of course
It's hard to have intercourse over four sets of corsets...

[LAURENS]
No more sex, pour me another brew, son!
Let's raise a couple more...

[LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
To the revolution!

[LAURENS]
Well, if it ain't the prodigy of Princeton college!

[MULLIGAN]
Aaron Burr!

[LAURENS]
Give us a verse, drop some knowledge!

[BURR]
Good luck with that: you're takin' a stand
You spit. I'm ‘a sit. We'll see where we land

[LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
Boooo!

[LAURENS]
Burr, the revolution's imminent. What do you stall for?

[HAMILTON]
If you stand for nothing, Burr, what'll you fall for?
[LAURENS]
Ooh
Who are you? [MULLIGAN]
Ooh

Who are you? [LAFAYETTE]
Ooh

Who are you?

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE/LAURENS]
Ooh, who is this kid? What's he gonna do?

My Shot

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[HAMILTON]
I am not throwing away my shot!
I am not throwing away my shot!
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot!
I'm ‘a get a scholarship to King's College
I prob'ly shouldn't brag, but dag, I amaze and astonish
The problem is I got a lot of brains but no polish
I gotta holler just to be heard
With every word, I drop knowledge!
I'm a diamond in the rough, a shiny piece of coal
Tryin' to reach my goal. My power of speech: unimpeachable
Only nineteen but my mind is older
These New York City streets get colder, I shoulder
Ev'ry burden, ev'ry disadvantage
I have learned to manage, I don't have a gun to brandish
I walk these streets famished
The plan is to fan this spark into a flame
But damn, it's getting dark, so let me spell out the name
I am the-

[HAMILTON/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN/LAURENS]
A-L-E-X-A-N-D
E-R-we are-meant to be...

[HAMILTON]
A colony that runs independently
Meanwhile, Britain keeps shittin' on us endlessly
Essentially, they tax us relentlessly
Then King George turns around, runs a spending spree
He ain't ever gonna set his descendants free
So there will be a revolution in this century
Enter me!

[LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN/LAURENS]
(He says in parentheses)

[HAMILTON]
Don't be shocked when your hist'ry book mentions me
I will lay down my life if it sets us free
Eventually, you'll see my ascendancy
[HAMILTON]
And I am not throwing away
My shot
I am not throwing away
My shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot
[LAURENS]
My shot!

My shot!

And I'm not throwing away my shot.

[HAMILTON/MULLIGAN/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE]
I am not throwing away my shot
I am not throwing away my shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot
It's time to take a shot!

[LAFAYETTE]
I dream of life without a monarchy
The unrest in France will lead to ‘onarchy?
‘Onarchy? How you say, how you say, ‘anarchy?'
When I fight, I make the other side panicky
With my-

[HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
Shot!

[MULLIGAN]
Yo, I'm a tailor's apprentice
And I got y'all knuckleheads in loco parentis
I'm joining the rebellion cuz I know it's my chance
To socially advance, instead of sewin' some pants!
I'm gonna take a-

[HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
Shot!

[LAURENS]
But we'll never be truly free
Until those in bondage have the same rights as you and me
You and I. Do or die. Wait till I sally in
On a stallion with the first black battalion
Have another-

[HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
Shot!

[BURR]
Geniuses, lower your voices
You keep out of trouble and you double your choices
I'm with you, but the situation is fraught
You've got to be carefully taught:
If you talk, you're gonna get shot!

[HAMILTON]
Burr, check what we got
Mister Lafayette, hard rock like Lancelot
I think your pants look hot
Laurens, I like you a lot
Let's hatch a plot blacker than the kettle callin' the pot...
What are the odds the gods would put us all in one spot
Poppin' a squat on conventional wisdom, like it or not
A bunch of revolutionary manumission abolitionists?
Give me a position, show me where the ammunition is!

Oh, am I talkin' too loud?
Sometimes I get over excited, shoot off at the mouth
I never had a group of friends before
I promise that I'll make y'all proud

[LAURENS]
Let's get this guy in front of a crowd

[HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN/ENSEMBLE]
I am not throwing away my shot
I am not throwing away my shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot

I am not throwing away my shot
I am not throwing away my shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot
[LAURENS]
Ev'rybody sing:
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Hey!
Whoa!
Wooh!!
Whoa!
Ay, let ‘em hear ya!

Let's go!

I said shout it to the rooftops!
Said, to the rooftops!
Come on!

Come on, let's go! [HAMILTON/LAFAYETTE/
MULLIGAN]
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

Whoa!

Whoa!

Yea!

[COMPANY]
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

Yea!

[LAURENS]
Rise up!
When you're living on your knees, you rise up
Tell your brother that he's gotta rise up
Tell your sister that she's gotta rise up
[LAURENS AND ENSEMBLE]
When are these colonies gonna rise up?
When are these colonies gonna rise up?
When are these colonies gonna rise up?
When are these colonies gonna rise up?

Rise up!
[COMPANY]
Whoa! Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!

Rise up!

[HAMILTON]
I imagine death so much it feels more like a memory
When's it gonna get me?
In my sleep? Seven feet ahead of me?
If I see it comin', do I run or do I let it be?
Is it like a beat without a melody?
See, I never thought I'd live past twenty
Where I come from some get half as many
Ask anybody why we livin' fast and we laugh, reach for a flask
We have to make this moment last, that's plenty

Scratch that
This is not a moment, it's the movement
Where all the hungriest brothers with
Something to prove went?
Foes oppose us, we take an honest stand
We roll like Moses, claimin' our promised land
And? If we win our independence?
‘Zat a guarantee of freedom for our descendants?
Or will the blood we shed begin an endless
Cycle of vengeance and death with no defendants?
I know the action in the street is excitin'
But Jesus, between all the bleedin' ‘n fightin'
I've been readin' ‘n writin'
We need to handle our financial situation
Are we a nation of states? What's the state of our nation?
I'm past patiently waitin'. I'm passionately
Smashin' every expectation
Every action's an act of creation!
I'm laughin' in the face of casualties and sorrow
For the first time, I'm thinkin' past tomorrow

[HAMILTON AND COMPANY]
And I am not throwing away my shot
I am not throwing away my shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot

There's nothing rich folks love more
Than going downtown and slummin' it with the poor
They pull up in their carriages and gawk
At the students in the common
Just to watch them talk
Take Philip Schuyler: the man is loaded
Uh-oh, but little does he know that
His daughters, Peggy, Angelica, Eliza
Sneak into the city just to watch all the guys at-

Why you slummin' in the city in your fancy heels
You searchin for an urchin who can give you ideals?

[BURR]
Ah, so you've discussed me
I'm a trust fund, baby, you can trust me!

Farmer Refuted

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[SEABURY]
Hear ye, hear ye! My name is Samuel Seabury
And I present "Free Thoughts on the
Proceedings of the Continental Congress!"
Heed not the rabble who scream revolution
They have not your interests at heart

[MULLIGAN]
Oh my God. Tear this dude apart

[SEABURY]
Chaos and bloodshed are not a solution
Don't let them lead you astray
This Congress does not speak for me

[BURR]
Let him be

[SEABURY]
They're playing a dangerous game
I pray the king shows you his mercy
For shame, for shame...
[HAMILTON]
Yo!
He'd have you all unravel at the
Sound of screams but the
Revolution is comin'
The have-nots are gonna
Win this
It's hard to listen to you with a straight face

Chaos and bloodshed already haunt us, honestly you shouldn't even talk. And what about Boston? Look at the cost, n' all that we've lost n' you talk
About Congress?!

My dog speaks more eloquently than thee!

But strangely, your mange is the same

Is he in Jersey?

For the revolution!
[SEABURY]
Heed not the rabble
Who scream
Revolution, they
Have not your
Interests
At heart

Chaos and bloodshed are
Not a
Solution. Don't
Let them lead you
Astray
This Congress does not
Speak for me

They're playing a dangerous game

I pray the king shows you his mercy

For shame

For shame,

[COMPANY]
For the revolution!

[SEABURY]
Heed-

[HAMILTON]
If you repeat yourself again I'm gonna-

[SEABURY/HAMILTON]
Scream-

[HAMILTON]
Honestly, look at me, please don't read!

[SEABURY]
Not your interests-

[HAMILTON]
Don't modulate the key then not debate with me!
Why should a tiny island across the sea regulate the price of tea?

[BURR]
Alexander, please!

[HAMILTON]
Burr, I'd rather be divisive than indecisive, drop the niceties

Silence! A message from the King!

You'll Be Back

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[KING GEORGE]
You say
The price of my love's not a price that you're willing to pay
You cry
In your tea which you hurl in the sea when you see me go by
Why so sad?
Remember we made an arrangement when you went away
Now you're making me mad
Remember, despite our estrangement, I'm your man
You'll be back
Soon you'll see
You'll remember you belong to me
You'll be back
Time will tell
You'll remember that I served you well
Oceans rise
Empires fall
We have seen each other through it all
And when push
Comes to shove
I will send a fully armed battalion
To remind you of my love!

Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da
Da da dat dat da ya da!
Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da
Da da dat dat da...

You say our love is draining and you can't go on
You'll be the one complaining when I am gone...
And no, don't change the subject
Cuz you're my favorite subject
My sweet, submissive subject
My loyal, royal subject
Forever and ever and ever and ever and ever...

You'll be back
Like before
I will fight the fight and win the war
For your love
For your praise
And I'll love you till my dying days
When you're gone
I'll go mad
So don't throw away this thing we had

Cuz when push comes to shove
I will kill your friends and family to remind you of my love
Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da
Da da dat dat da ya da!
Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da
Da da dat-
Everybody!

[ENSEMBLE]
Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da

[HAMILTON]
If they tell my story
I am either gonna die on the battlefield in glory or-

[HAMILTON/BURR/MULLIGAN/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE]

We will fight for this land
But there's only one man
Who can give us a command so we can-

We gotta make an all out stand
Ayo, I'm gonna need a right-hand man.
ENSEMBLE
What?

What?

Buck, buck, buck, buck, buck!

Buck, buck, buck, buck, buck!

[WASHINGTON]
Check it-
Can I be real a second?
For just a millisecond?
Let down my guard and tell the people how I feel a second?
Now I'm the model of a modern major general
The venerated Virginian veteran whose men are all
Lining up, to put me up on a pedestal
Writin' letters to relatives
Embellishin' my elegance and eloquence
But the elephant is in the room
The truth is in ya face when ya hear the British cannons go...

[ENSEMBLE]
Boom!

[WASHINGTON]
Any hope of success is fleeting
How can I keep leading when the people I'm
Leading keep retreating?
We put a stop to the bleeding as the British take Brooklyn
Knight takes rook, but look
[WASHINGTON]
We are outgunned

Outmanned

Outnumbered
Outplanned

We gotta make an all out stand
Ayo, I'm gonna need a right-hand man

Incoming!

Buck, buck, buck, buck, buck!

[MULLIGAN]

[HAMILTON]
We gotta stop ‘em and rob ‘em of their advantages

[MULLIGAN]

[HAMILTON]
Let's take a stand with the stamina God has granted us
Hamilton won't abandon ship
Yo, let's steal their cannons-
[MULLIGAN]
Shh-boom! [COMPANY]
Boom!

[WASHINGTON]
Goes the cannon, watch the blood and the shit spray and...

[COMPANY]
Boom!

[WASHINGTON]
Goes the cannon, we're abandonin' Kips Bay and...

[COMPANY]
Boom!

[WASHINGTON]
There's another ship and...

[COMPANY]
Boom!

[WASHINGTON]
We just lost the southern tip and...

[COMPANY]
Boom!

[WASHINGTON]
We gotta run to Harlem quick, we can't afford another slip
Guns and horses giddyup
I decide to divvy up
My forces, they're skittish as the British cut the city up
This close to giving up, facing mad scrutiny
I scream in the face of this mass mutiny:
Are these the men with which I am to defend America?
We ride at midnight, Manhattan in the distance
I cannot be everywhere at once, people
I'm in dire need of assistance...

[BURR]
Your excellency, sir!

[WASHINGTON]
Who are you?

[BURR]
Aaron Burr, Sir?
Permission to state my case?

[WASHINGTON]
As you were

[BURR]
Sir
I was a captain under General Montgomery
Until he caught a bullet in the neck in Quebec
And well, in summary
I think that I could be of some assistance
I admire how you keep firing on the British
From a distance

[WASHINGTON]
Huh

[BURR]
I have some questions, a couple of suggestions on how to fight instead of fleeing west

[WASHINGTON]
Yes?

[BURR]
Well-

[HAMILTON]
Your excellency, you wanted to see me?

[WASHINGTON]
Hamilton, come in, have you met Burr?

[HAMILTON]
Yes, sir

[HAMILTON AND BURR]
We keep meeting

[BURR]
As I was saying, sir, I look forward to seeing your strategy play out

[WASHINGTON]
Burr?

[BURR]
Sir?

[WASHINGTON]
Close the door on your way out

[HAMILTON]
Have I done something wrong, sir?

[WASHINGTON]
On the contrary
I called you here because our odds are beyond scary
Your reputation precedes you, but I have to laugh

[HAMILTON]
Sir?

[WASHINGTON]
Hamilton, how come no one can get you on their staff?

[HAMILTON]
Sir!

[WASHINGTON]
Don't get me wrong, you're a young man, of great renown
I know you stole British cannons when we were still downtown
Nathaniel Green and Henry Knox wanted to hire you...

[HAMILTON]
To be their Secretary? I don't think so

[WASHINGTON]
Why're you upset?

[HAMILTON]
I'm not-

[WASHINGTON]
It's alright, you want to fight, you've got a hunger
I was just like you when I was younger
Head full of fantasies of dyin' like a martyr?

[HAMILTON]
Yes

[WASHINGTON]
Dying is easy, young man. Living is harder

[HAMILTON]
Why are you telling me this?

[WASHINGTON]
I'm being honest
I'm working with a third of what our Congress has promised
We are a powder keg about to explode
I need someone like you to lighten the load. So?

[COMPANY (EXCEPT HAMILTON)]
I am not throwin' away my shot!
I am not throwin' away my shot!
Ayo, I'm just like my country, I'm young
Scrappy and hungry!

[HAMILTON]
I am not throwing away my shot!

[WASHINGTON]
Son

[WASHINGON AND COMPANY]
We are outgunned, outmanned!

[HAMILTON]
You need all the help you can get
I have some friends. Laurens, Mulligan
Marquis de Lafayette, okay, what else?

[WASHINGTON AND COMPANY]
Outnumbered, outplanned!

[HAMILTON]
We'll need some spies on the inside
Some King's men who might let some things slide
[HAMILTON]
I'll write to Congress and tell ‘em we need supplies, you rally the guys, master the element of surprise

I'll rise above my station, organize your information, ‘til we rise to the occasion of our new nation. Sir!

A Winter's Ball

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[BURR]
How does the bastard, orphan, son of a whore
Go on and on
Grow into more of a phenomenon?
Watch this obnoxious, arrogant, loudmouth bother
Be seated at the right hand of the father
Washington hires Hamilton right on sight
But Hamilton still wants to fight, not write
Now Hamilton's skill with a quill is undeniable
But what do we have in common? We're
Reliable with the

Helpless!
Look into your eyes, and the sky's the limit I'm helpless!
Down for the count, and I'm drownin' in ‘em

[ELIZA]
I have never been the type to try and grab the spotlight
We were at a revel with some rebels on a hot night
Laughin' at my sister as she's dazzling the room
Then you walked in and my heart went "Boom!"
Tryin' to catch your eye from the side of the ballroom
Everybody's dancin' and the band's top volume

[ELIZA AND WOMEN]
Grind to the rhythm as we wine and dine
[ELIZA]
Grab my sister, and
Whisper, "Yo, this
One's mine."

My sister made her way across the room to you
And I got nervous, thinking "What's she gonna do?"
She grabbed you by the arm, I'm thinkin' "I'm through"
Then you look back at me and suddenly I'm
Helpless!

Oh, look at those eyes

Oh!
Yeah, I'm
Helpless, I know

I'm so into you
I am so into you

I know I'm down for the count
And I'm drownin' in ‘em.

[ANGELICA]

[ELIZA]
Thank you for all your service

[HAMILTON]
If it takes fighting a war for us to meet, it will have been worth it

[ANGELICA]
I'll leave you to it

[ELIZA AND WOMEN]
One week later

[ELIZA]
I'm writin' a letter nightly
Now my life gets better, every letter that you write me
Laughin' at my sister, cuz she wants to form a harem

[ANGELICA]
I'm just sayin', if you really loved me, you would share him
[ELIZA]
Ha!
Two weeks later
In the living room stressin'
My father's stone-faced
While you're asking for his blessin'
I'm dying inside, as
You wine
And dine
And I'm tryin' not to cry
‘cause there's nothing that your mind can't do
My father makes his way across the room
To you
I panic for a second, thinking
"we're through"
But then he shakes your hand and says
"Be true"
And you turn back to me, smiling, and I'm
Helpless!

Helpless!
Hoo!

That boy is mine
That boy is mine!

Helpless! Helpless!
Down for the count

Down for the count
And I'm drownin' in em

[HAMILTON]
Eliza, I don't have a dollar to my name
An acre of land, a troop to command, a dollop of fame
All I have's my honor, a tolerance for pain
A couple of college credits and my top-notch brain
Insane, your family brings out a different side of me
Peggy confides in me, Angelica tried to take a bite of me
No stress, my love for you is never in doubt
We'll get a little place in Harlem and we'll figure it out
I've been livin' without a family since I was a child
My father left, my mother died, I grew up buckwild
But I'll never forget my mother's face, that was real
And long as I'm alive, Eliza, swear to God
You'll never feel so...

[HAMILTON]
Eliza...

I've never felt so-

My life is gon' be fine cuz Eliza's in it.
[ELIZA]
I do I do I do I do!

I do I do I do I do!

Hey, yeah, yeah!

I'm down for the count

Who is always by your side

To your union

And the hope that you provide

May you always...

Be satisfied.

[ALL MEN]

[HAMILTON AND MEN]
Always-

Rewind-

[ALL WOMEN]
To the groom!

To the bride!

To the bride!

[ELIZA AND WOMEN]
Angelica!

By your side!

To the union!
To the revolution!

You provide!

Always-

Rewind-

[ANGELICA]
I remember that night, I just might
Regret that night for the rest of my days

I remember those soldier boys
Tripping over themselves to win our praise

I remember that dreamlike candlelight
Like a dream that you can't quite place

But Alexander, I'll never forget the first
Time I saw your face

I have never been the same
Intelligent eyes in a hunger-pang frame
And when you said "Hi," I forgot my dang name
Set my heart aflame, ev'ry part aflame

[FULL COMPANY]
This is not a game...

[HAMILTON]
You strike me as a woman who has never been satisfied

[ANGELICA]
I'm sure I don't know what you mean. You forget yourself

[HAMILTON]
You're like me. I'm never satisfied

[ANGELICA]
Is that right?

[HAMILTON]
I have never been satisfied

[ANGELICA]
My name is Angelica Schuyler

[HAMILTON]
Alexander Hamilton

[ANGELICA]
Where's your fam'ly from?

[HAMILTON]
Unimportant. There's a million things I haven't done but
Just you wait, just you wait...

[ANGELICA]
So so so-
So this is what it feels like to match wits
With someone at your level! What the hell is the catch? It's
The feeling of freedom, of seein' the light
It's Ben Franklin with a key and a kite! You see it, right?
The conversation lasted two minutes, maybe three minutes
Ev'rything we said in total agreement, it's
A dream and it's a bit of a dance
A bit of a posture, it's a bit of a stance. He's a
Bit of a flirt, but I'm ‘a give it a chance
I asked about his fam'ly, did you see his answer?
His hands started fidgeting, he looked askance?
He's penniless, he's flying by the seat of his pants

Handsome, boy, does he know it!
Peach fuzz, and he can't even grow it!
I wanna take him far away from this place
Then I turn and see my sister's face and she is...

[ELIZA]
Helpless...

[ANGELICA]
And I know she is...

[ELIZA]
Helpless...

[ANGELICA]
And her eyes are just...

[ELIZA]
Helpless...

[ANGELICA]
And I realize

[ANGELICA AND COMPANY]
Three fundamental truths at the exact same time...

[HAMILTON]
Where are you taking me?

[ANGELICA]
I'm about to change your life

[HAMILTON]
Then by all means, lead the way

[COMPANY (EXCEPT ANGELICA)]
Number one!

[ANGELICA]
I'm a girl in a world in which
My only job is to marry rich
My father has no sons so I'm the one
Who has to social climb for one
So I'm the oldest and the wittiest and the gossip in
New York City is insidious
Alexander is penniless
Ha! That doesn't mean I want him any less

[ELIZA]
Elizabeth Schuyler. It's a pleasure to meet you

[HAMILTON]
Schuyler?

[ANGELICA]
My sister

[COMPANY]
Number two!

[ANGELICA]
He's after me cuz I'm a Schuyler sister
That elevates his status, I'd
Have to be naïve to set that aside
Maybe that is why I introduce him to Eliza
Now that's his bride
Nice going, Angelica, he was right
You will never be satisfied

[ELIZA]
Thank you for all your service

[HAMILTON]
If it takes fighting a war for us to meet, it will have been worth it

[ANGELICA]
I'll leave you to it

[COMPANY]
Number three!

[ANGELICA]
I know my sister like I know my own mind
You will never find anyone as trusting or as kind
If I tell her that I love him she'd be silently resigned
He'd be mine
She would say, "I'm fine"

[ANGELICA AND COMPANY]
She'd be lying

[ANGELICA]
But when I fantasize at night
It's Alexander's eyes
As I romanticize what might
Have been if I hadn't sized him
Up so quickly
At least my dear Eliza's his wife;
At least I keep his eyes in my life...
[ANGELICA]
To the groom!

To the bride!

From your sister

Who is always by your side

To your union

And the hope that you provide

May you always

Be satisfied

And I know

She'll be happy as

His bride
And I know [ALL MEN (EXCEPT HAMILTON)]
To the groom!
To the groom!
To the groom!

To the bride!
To the bride!

Angelica!
Angelica!

By your side

To the union!
To the revolution!

You provide!

[HAMILTON AND MEN]
Always-

Be satisfied

Be satisfied

[MEN]
Be satisfied
Be satisfied
Be satisfied
Be satisfied

Be satisfied

Be satisfied
Be satisfied
Be satisfied
Be satisfied.

[ALL WOMEN (EXCEPT ELIZA)]

The Story of Tonight (Reprise)

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[LAURENS]
I may not live to see our glory!

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE]
I may not live to see our glory!

[LAURENS]
But I've seen wonders great and small

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE]
I've seen wonders great and small

[LAURENS]
‘Cause if the tomcat can get married

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE]
If Alexander can get married-

[LAURENS]
There's hope for our ass, after all!

[LAFAYETTE]
Raise a glass to freedom

[LAURENS/MULLIGAN]
Hey!
Something you will never see again!

[MULLIGAN]
No matter what she tells you

[LAFAYETTE]
Let's have another round tonight!

[LAURENS]
Raise a glass to the four of us!

[LAFAYETTE/HAMILTON]
Ho!

[MULLIGAN]
To the newly not poor of us!

[LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/HAMILTON]
Woo!

[LAFAYETTE]
We'll tell the story of tonight

[LAURENS]
Let's have another round-

[HAMILTON]
Well, if it isn't Aaron Burr

[BURR]
Sir!

[HAMILTON]
I didn't think that you would make it

[BURR]
To be sure

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE]
Burr!

[BURR]
I came to say congratulations

[MULLIGAN]
Spit a verse, Burr!

[BURR]
I see the whole gang is here

[LAFAYETTE]
You are the worst, Burr!

[HAMILTON]
Ignore them. Congrats to you, Lieutenant Colonel
I wish I had your command instead of manning George's journal

[BURR]
No, you don't

[HAMILTON]
Yes, I do

[BURR]
Now, be sensible
From what I hear, you've made yourself indispensable

[LAURENS]
Well, well, I heard
You've got a special someone on the side, Burr

[HAMILTON]
Is that so?

[LAURENS]
What are you tryin' to hide, Burr?

[BURR]
I should go

[HAMILTON]
No, these guys should go

[LAFAYETTE]
What?

[LAURENS]
No!

[HAMILTON]
Leave us alone

[MULLIGAN]
Man...

[HAMILTON]
It's alright, Burr. I wish you'd brought this girl with you tonight, Burr

[BURR]
You're very kind, but I'm afraid it's unlawful, sir

[HAMILTON]
What do you mean?

[BURR]
She's married

[HAMILTON]
I see

[BURR]
She's married to a British officer

[HAMILTON]
Oh shit...

[BURR]
Congrats again, Alexander. Smile more
I'll see you on the other side of the war

[HAMILTON]
I will never understand you
If you love this woman, go get her! What are you waiting for?

[BURR]
I'll see you on the other side of the war

[HAMILTON]
I'll see you on the other side of the war

Wait For It

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[BURR]
Theodosia writes me a letter everyday
I'm keeping the bed warm while her husband is away
He's on the British side in Georgia
He's trying to keep the colonies in line
But he can keep all of Georgia
Theodosia, she's mine

Love doesn't discriminate
Between the sinners
And the saints
It takes and it takes and it takes
And we keep loving anyway
We laugh and we cry
And we break
And we make our mistakes
And if there's a reason I'm by her side
When so many have tried
Then I'm willing to wait for it
I'm willing to wait for it
[BURR]
My grandfather was a fire and brimstone preacher

But there are things that the
Homilies and hymns won't teach ya

My mother was a genius

My father commanded respect

When they died they left no instructions
Just a legacy to protect

[MEN]
Preacher, preacher
Preacher

Teach ya, teach ya, teach ya

Respect, respect

[WOMEN]
Genius

[BURR/ENSEMBLE]
Death doesn't discriminate
Between the sinners
And the saints
It takes and it takes and it takes
And we keep living anyway
We rise and we fall
And we break
And we make our mistakes
And if there's a reason I'm still alive
When everyone who loves me has died
I'm willing to wait for it
I'm willing to wait for it

Wait for it

[ENSEMBLE]
Wait for it
Wait for it
Wait for it

[BURR]
I am the one thing in life I can control

[ENSEMBLE]
Wait for it

I am inimitable
I am an original

[ENSEMBLE]
Wait for it

[BURR]
I'm not falling behind or running late

[ENSEMBLE]
Wait for it
Wait for it
Wait for it

[BURR]
I'm not standing still
I am lying in wait

[ENSEMBLE]
Wait
Wait

[BURR]
Hamilton faces an endless uphill climb

[ENSEMBLE]
Climb
Climb
Climb

[BURR]
He has something to prove
He has nothing to lose

[ENSEMBLE]
Lose
Lose
Lose
Lose

[BURR]
Hamilton's pace is relentless
He wastes no time

[ENSEMBLE]
Time
Time
Time

[BURR]
What is it like in his shoes?

Hamilton doesn't hesitate
He exhibits no restraint
He takes and he takes and he takes
And he keeps winning anyway
He changes the game
He plays and he raises the stakes
And if there's a reason
He seems to thrive when so few survive, then Goddamnit-
[BURR]
I'm willing to wait for it

I'm willing to wait for it...

Life doesn't discriminate
Between the sinners and the saints
It takes and it takes and it takes

We rise
We fall

And if there's a reason I'm still alive
When so many have died
Then I'm willin' to-
[COMPANY]
I'm willing to wait for it
Wait for it
Wait for...
I'm willing to-

Life doesn't discriminate
Between the sinners and the saints
It takes and it takes and it takes
And we keep living anyway
We rise and we fall and we break
And we make our mistakes
And if there's a reason I'm still alive
When so many have died
Then I'm willin' to-

Stay Alive

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[ELIZA]
Stay alive...

[ELIZA/ANGELICA/ENSEMBLE WOMEN]
Stay alive...

[HAMILTON]
I have never seen the General so despondent
I have taken over writing all his correspondence
Congress writes, "George, attack the British forces."
I shoot back, we have resorted to eating our horses
Local merchants deny us equipment, assistance
They only take British money, so sing a song of sixpence

[WASHINGTON]
The cavalry's not coming

[HAMILTON]
Sir!

[WASHINGTON]
Alex, listen. There's only one way for us to win this
Provoke outrage, outright

[HAMILTON]
That's right

[WASHINGTON]
Don't engage, strike by night
Remain relentless ‘til their troops take flight

[HAMILTON]
Make it impossible to justify the cost of the fight

[WASHINGTON]
Outrun

[HAMILTON]
Outrun

[WASHINGTON]
Outlast

[HAMILTON]
Outlast

[WASHINGTON]
Hit ‘em quick, get out fast

[HAMILTON]
Chick-a-plao!

[WASHINGTON]
Stay alive ‘til this horror show is past
We're gonna fly a lot of flags half-mast

[HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE]
Raise a glass!

[MULLIGAN]
I go back to New York and my apprenticeship

[LAFAYETTE]
I ask for French aid, I pray that France has sent a ship

[LAURENS]
I stay at work with Hamilton
We write essays against slavery
And every day's a test of our camaraderie
And bravery

[HAMILTON]
We cut supply lines, we steal contraband
We pick and choose our battles and places to take a stand
And ev'ry day
"Sir, entrust me with a command,"
And ev'ry day

[WASHINGTON]
No

[HAMILTON]
He dismisses me out of hand
[HAMILTON]
Instead of me
He promotes
Charles Lee
Makes him second-in-command:

[LEE]
Charles Lee. [ELIZA/ANGELICA]
Stay alive...

[LEE]
I'm a General. Whee!!!!

[HAMILTON]
Yeah. He's not the choice I would have gone with

[HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE]
He shits the bed at the Battle of Monmouth

[WASHINGTON]
Ev'ryone attack!

[LEE]
Retreat!

[WASHINGTON]
Attack!

[LEE]
Retreat!

[WASHINGTON]
What are you doing, Lee? Get back on your feet!

[LEE]
But there's so many of them!

[WASHINGTON]
I'm sorry, is this not your speed?!
Hamilton!

[HAMILTON]
Ready, sir!

[WASHINGTON]
Have Lafayette take the lead!

[HAMILTON]
Yes, sir!

[LAURENS]
A thousand soldiers die in a hundred degree heat

[LAFAYETTE]
As we snatch a stalemate from the jaws of defeat

[HAMILTON]
Charles Lee was left behind
Without a pot to piss in
He started sayin' this to anybody who would listen:

[LEE]
Washington cannot be left alone to his devices
Indecisive, from crisis to crisis
The best thing he can do for the revolution
Is turn n' go back to plantin' tobacco in Mount Vernon

[COMPANY]
Oo!!

[WASHINGTON]
Don't do a thing. History will prove him wrong

[HAMILTON]
But, sir!

[WASHINGTON]
We have a war to fight, let's move along

[LAURENS]
Strong words from Lee, someone oughta hold him to it

[HAMILTON]
I can't disobey direct orders

[LAURENS]
Then I'll do it
Alexander, you're the closest friend I've got

[HAMILTON]
Laurens, do not throw away your shot

Ten Duel Commandments

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[MEN]
One, two, three, four

[FULL COMPANY]
Five, six, seven, eight, nine...

[BURR/HAMILTON/LAURENS/LEE]
It's the Ten Duel Commandments

[FULL COMPANY]
It's the Ten Duel Commandments
Number one!

[LAURENS]
The challenge: demand satisfaction
If they apologize, no need for further action

[COMPANY]
Number two!

[LAURENS]
If they don't, grab a friend, that's your second

[HAMILTON]
Your lieutenant when there's reckoning to be reckoned

[COMPANY]
Number three!

[LEE]
Have your seconds meet face to face

[BURR]
Negotiate a peace...

[HAMILTON]
Or negotiate a time and place

[BURR]
This is commonplace, ‘specially ‘tween recruits

[COMPANY]
Most disputes die, and no one shoots
Number four!

[LAURENS]
If they don't reach a peace, that's alright
Time to get some pistols and a doctor on site

[HAMILTON]
You pay him in advance, you treat him with civility

[BURR]
You have him turn around so he can have deniability

[COMPANY]
Five!

[LEE]
Duel before the sun is in the sky

[COMPANY]
Pick a place to die where it's high and dry
Number six!

[HAMILTON]
Leave a note for your next of kin
Tell ‘em where you been. Pray that hell or heaven lets you in

[COMPANY]
Seven!

[LEE]
Confess your sins. Ready for the moment of adrenaline when you finally face your opponent

[COMPANY]
Number eight!

[LAURENS/LEE/HAMILTON/BURR]
Your last chance to negotiate
Send in your seconds, see if they can set the record straight...

[BURR]
Alexander

[HAMILTON]
Aaron Burr, sir

[BURR]
Can we agree that duels are dumb and immature?

[HAMILTON]
Sure
But your man has to answer for his words, Burr

[BURR]
With his life? We both know that's absurd, sir

[HAMILTON]
Hang on, how many men died because Lee was inexperienced and ruinous?

[BURR]
Okay, so we're doin' this

[COMPANY]
Number nine!

[HAMILTON]
Look ‘em in the eye, aim no higher
Summon all the courage you require
Then count

[MEN]
One two three four

[FULL COMPANY]
Five six seven eight nine

[HAMILTON/BURR]
Number

[COMPANY]
Ten paces!

[HAMILTON/BURR]
Fire!

Meet Me Inside

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[HAMILTON]
Lee, do you yield?

[BURR]
You shot him in the side!
Yes, he yields!

[LAURENS]
I'm satisfied

[BURR]
Yo, we gotta clear the field!

[HAMILTON]
Go! We won

[COMPANY]
Here comes the General!

[BURR]
This should be fun

[WASHINGTON]
What is the meaning of this? Mr. Burr, get a medic for the General

[BURR]
Yes, sir

[WASHINGTON]
Lee, you will never agree with me
But believe me, these young men don't speak for me
Thank you for your service

[BURR]
Let's ride!

[WASHINGTON]
Hamilton!

[HAMILTON]
Sir!

[WASHINGTON]
Meet me inside

[COMPANY]
Meet him inside! Meet him inside!
Meet him inside, meet him, meet him inside!

[WASHINGTON]
Son-

[HAMILTON]
Don't call me son

[WASHINGTON]
This war is hard enough
Without infighting-

[HAMILTON]
Lee called you out. We called his bluff

[WASHINGTON]
You solve nothing, you aggravate our allies to the south

[HAMILTON]
You're absolutely right, John should have shot him in the mouth
That would've shut him up

[WASHINGTON]
Son-

[HAMILTON]
I'm notcha son-

[WASHINGTON]
Watch your tone
I am not a maiden in need of defending, I am grown

[HAMILTON (OVERLAPPING)]
Charles Lee, Thomas Conway
These men take your name and they rake it
Through the mud

[WASHINGTON]
My name's been through a lot, I can take it

[HAMILTON]
Well, I don't have your name. I don't have your titles
I don't have your land
But, if you-

[WASHINGTON]
No-

[HAMILTON]
If you gave me command of a battalion, a group of men to lead, I could fly above my station after the war

[WASHINGTON]
Or you could die and we need you alive

[HAMILTON]
I'm more than willing to die-

[WASHINGTON]
Your wife needs you alive, son, I need you alive-

[HAMILTON]
Call me son one more time-

[WASHINGTON]
Go home, Alexander
That's an order from your commander

[HAMILTON]
Sir-

[WASHINGTON]
Go home

That Would Be Enough

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[ELIZA]
Look around, look around at how lucky we are
To be alive right now
Look around, look around...

[HAMILTON]
How long have you known?

[ELIZA]
A month or so

[HAMILTON]
Eliza, you should have told me

[ELIZA]
I wrote to the General a month ago

[HAMILTON]
No

[ELIZA]
I begged him to send you home

[HAMILTON]
You should have told me

[ELIZA]
I'm not sorry
[ELIZA]
I knew you'd fight
Until the war was won

But you deserve a chance to meet your son
Look around, look around at how lucky we are
To be alive right now.
[HAMILTON]
The war's not
Done.

[HAMILTON]
Will you relish being a poor man's wife
Unable to provide for your life?

[ELIZA]
I relish being your wife
Look around, look around...

Look at where you are
Look at where you started
The fact that you're alive is a miracle
Just stay alive, that would be enough

And if this child
Shares a fraction of your smile
Or a fragment of your mind, look out world!
That would be enough

I don't pretend to know
The challenges you're facing
The worlds you keep erasing and creating in your mind

But I'm not afraid
I know who I married
So long as you come home at the end of the day
That would be enough

We don't need a legacy
We don't need money
If I could grant you peace of mind

If you could let me inside your heart...
Oh, let me be a part of the narrative
In the story they will write someday
Let this moment be the first chapter:
Where you decide to stay
And I could be enough
And we could be enough
That would be enough

Guns and Ships

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[BURR]
How does a ragtag volunteer army in need of a shower
Somehow defeat a global superpower?
How do we emerge victorious from the quagmire?
Leave the battlefield waving Betsy Ross' flag higher?
Yo. Turns out we have a secret weapon!
An immigrant you know and love who's unafraid to step in!
He's constantly confusin', confoundin' the British henchmen
Ev'ryone give it up for America's favorite fighting Frenchman!

[COMPANY]
Lafayette!

[LAFAYETTE]
I'm takin this horse by the reins makin'
Redcoats redder with bloodstains

[COMPANY]
Lafayette!

[LAFAYETTE]
And I'm never gonna stop until I make ‘em
Drop and burn ‘em up and scatter their remains, I'm

[COMPANY]
Lafayette!

[LAFAYETTE]
Watch me engagin' em! Escapin' em!
Enragin' em! I'm-

[COMPANY]
Lafayette!

[LAFAYETTE]
I go to France for more funds

[COMPANY]
Lafayette!

[LAFAYETTE]
I come back with more

[LAFAYETTE AND ENSEMBLE]
Guns
And ships
And so the balance shifts

[WASHINGTON]
We rendezvous with Rochambeau, consolidate their gifts

[LAFAYETTE]
We can end this war at Yorktown, cut them off at sea, but
For this to succeed, there's someone else we need:

[WASHINGTON]
I know

[WASHINGTON AND COMPANY]
Hamilton!

[LAFAYETTE]
Sir, he knows what to do in a trench
Ingenuitive and fluent in French, ami-

[WASHINGTON AND COMPANY]
Hamilton!

[LAFAYETTE]
Sir, you're gonna have to use him eventually
What's he gonna do on the bench? I mean-

[WASHINGTON AND COMPANY]
Hamilton!

[LAFAYETTE]
No one has more resilience
Or matches my practical tactical brilliance-

[WASHINGTON AND COMPANY]
Hamilton!
[LAFAYETTE]
You wanna fight for your land back?

[WASHINGTON]
I need my right hand man back!

[LAFAYETTE]
Ah! Uh, get ya right hand man back
You know you gotta get ya right hand man back

I mean you gotta put some thought into the letter but the sooner the better
To get your right hand man back!

[COMPANY]
Hamilton!

[WOMEN]
Hamilton!

Hamilton!

Hamilton, Hamilton!
Ha- ha-!

[MEN]
Get your right hand man back!

Your right hand man back!

Hamilton!
Ha-
Ha-

Hamilton, Hamilton!
Ha- ha-!

[WASHINGTON]
Alexander Hamilton
Troops are waiting in the field for you
If you join us right now, together we can turn the tide
Oh, Alexander Hamilton
I have soldiers who will yield for you
If we manage to get this right
They'll surrender by early light
The world will never be the same, Alexander...

History Has Its Eyes On You

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[WASHINGTON]
I was younger than you are now
When I was given my first command
I led my men straight into a massacre
I witnessed their deaths firsthand
I made every mistake
I felt the shame rise in me
And even now I lie awake
[WASHINGTON]
Knowing history has its eyes on me

[HAMILTON/WASHINGTON]
History has its eyes on me. [LAURENS/MULLIGAN]
Whoa...
Whoa...
Whoa...
Yeah

[COMPANY]
Whoa...
Whoa...
Whoa...
Yeah

[WASHINGTON]
Let me tell you what I wish I'd known
When I was young and dreamed of glory:
You have no control:

[WASHINGTON AND COMPANY]
Who lives, who dies, who tells your story

[WASHINGTON]
I know that we can win
I know that greatness lies in you
But remember from here on in
[WASHINGTON/HAMILTON AND MEN]
History has its
Eyes on you.

How you say, no sweat
We're finally on the field. We've had quite a run

[LAFAYETTE]
Immigrants:

[HAMILTON/LAFAYETTE]
We get the job done

[HAMILTON]
So what happens if we win?

[LAFAYETTE]
I go back to France
I bring freedom to my people if I'm given the chance

We'll be with you when you do

See you on the other side

Weapon in my hand, a command, and my men with me
Then I remember my Eliza's expecting me...
Not only that, my Eliza's expecting
We gotta go, gotta get the job done
Gotta start a new nation, gotta meet my son!

We move under cover and we move as one
Through the night, we have one shot to live another day
We cannot let a stray gunshot give us away
We will fight up close, seize the moment and stay in it
It's either that or meet the business end of a bayonet
The code word is ‘Rochambeau,' dig me?

[ENSEMBLE]
Rochambeau!

[HAMILTON]
You have your orders now, go, man, go!
And so the American experiment begins
With my friends all scattered to the winds
Laurens is in South Carolina, redefining brav'ry

[HAMILTON/LAURENS]
We'll never be free until we end slavery!

[HAMILTON]
When we finally drive the British away
Lafayette is there waiting-

[HAMILTON/LAFAYETTE]
In Chesapeake Bay!

[HAMILTON]
How did we know that this plan would work?
We had a spy on the inside. That's right

[HAMILTON/COMPANY]
Hercules Mulligan!

[MULLIGAN]
A tailor spyin' on the British government!
I take their measurements, information and then I smuggle it

[COMPANY]
Up

[MULLIGAN]
To my brother's revolutionary covenant
I'm runnin' with the Sons of Liberty and I am lovin' it!
See, that's what happens when you up against the ruffians
We in the shit now, somebody gotta shovel it!
Hercules Mulligan, I need no introduction
When you knock me down I get the fuck back up again!

[COMPANY]
Left! Right! Hold!
Go!
What! What! What!

[HAMILTON]
After a week of fighting, a young man in a red coat stands on a parapet

[LAFAYETTE]
We lower our guns as he frantically waves a white handkerchief

[MULLIGAN]
And just like that, it's over. We tend to our wounded, we count our dead

[LAURENS]
Black and white soldiers wonder alike if this really means freedom

[WASHINGTON]
Not. Yet

[HAMILTON]
We negotiate the terms of surrender
I see George Washington smile
We escort their men out of Yorktown
They stagger home single file
Tens of thousands of people flood the streets
There are screams and church bells ringing
And as our fallen foes retreat
I hear the drinking song they're singing...

[ALL MEN]
The world turned upside down

[FULL COMPANY]
The world turned upside down
The world turned upside down
The world turned upside down
Down
Down, down, down

[LAFAYETTE]
Freedom for America, freedom for France!

[COMPANY]
Down, down, down

[HAMILTON]
Gotta start a new nation
Gotta meet my son

[COMPANY]
Down, down, down

[MULLIGAN]
We won!

[LAFAYETTE]
We won!

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE/LAURENS]
We won!

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE/LAURENS/HAMILTON/WASHINGTON]
We won!

[COMPANY]
The world turned upside down!

What Comes Next

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[KING GEORGE]
They say
The price of my war's not a price that they're willing to pay
Insane
You cheat with the French, now I'm fighting with France and with Spain
I'm so blue
I thought that we'd made an arrangement
When you went away
You were mine to subdue
Well, even despite our estrangement, I've got
A small query for you:

What comes next?
You've been freed
Do you know how hard it is to lead?

You're on your own
Awesome. Wow
Do you have a clue what happens now?

Oceans rise
Empires fall
It's much harder when it's all your call

All alone, across the sea
When your people say they hate you, don't
Come crawling back to me

Da da da dat da dat da da da
Da ya da
Da da dat
Da da ya da...

You're on your own...

Dear Theodosia

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[BURR]
Dear Theodosia, what to say to you?
You have my eyes. You have your mother's name

When you came into the world, you cried and it broke my heart

I'm dedicating every day to you
Domestic life was never quite my style
When you smile, you knock me out, I fall apart
And I thought I was so smart

You will come of age with our young nation
We'll bleed and fight for you, we'll make it right for you
If we lay a strong enough foundation
We'll pass it on to you, we'll give the world to you
And you'll blow us all away...
Someday, someday
Yeah, you'll blow us all away
Someday, someday

[HAMILTON]
Oh Philip, when you smile I am undone
My son
Look at my son. Pride is not the word I'm looking for

There is so much more inside me now
Oh Philip, you outshine the morning sun
My son
When you smile, I fall apart
And I thought I was so smart
My father wasn't around

[BURR]
My father wasn't around
[HAMILTON]
I swear that
I'll be around for you.
[BURR]
I'll be around for you.

[HAMILTON]
I'll do whatever it takes

[BURR]
I'll make a million mistakes

[BURR/HAMILTON]
I'll make the world safe and sound for you...
...will come of age with our young nation
We'll bleed and fight for you, we'll make it right for you

If we lay a strong enough foundation
We'll pass it on to you, we'll give the world to you
And you'll blow us all away...
Someday, someday
Yeah, you'll blow us all away
Someday, someday

Non-Stop

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[BURR]
After the war I went back to New York

[HAMILTON]
A-After the war I went back to New York

[BURR]
I finished up my studies and I practiced law

[HAMILTON]
I practiced law, Burr worked next door
[BURR]
Even though we started at the very same time
Alexander Hamilton began to climb
How to account for his rise to the top?
Maaaaan, the man is
Non-stop!

[ENSEMBLE]
Non-stop!

[HAMILTON]
Gentlemen of the jury, I'm curious, bear with me
Are you aware that we're making hist'ry?
This is the first murder trial of our brand-new nation
[HAMILTON]
The liberty behind
Deliberation-

[ENSEMBLE]
Non-stop!

[HAMILTON]
I intend to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt
With my assistant counsel-

[BURR]
Co-counsel
Hamilton, sit down
Our client Levi Weeks is innocent. Call your first witness
That's all you had to say!

[HAMILTON]
Okay!
One more thing-

[BURR]
Why do you assume you're the smartest in the room?
Why do you assume you're the smartest in the room?
Why do you assume you're the smartest in the room?
Soon that attitude may be your doom!

[ENSEMBLE]
Awwww!

[BURR]
Why do you write like you're running out of time?
Write day and night like you're running out of time?
Ev'ry day you fight, like you're running out of time

Keep on fighting. In the meantime- [ENSEMBLE]
Why do you write like you're running out of time?

Ev'ry day you fight, like you're running out of time

Non-stop!

[HAMILTON]
Corruption's such an old song that we can sing along in harmony
And nowhere is it stronger than in Albany
This colony's economy's increasingly stalling and

[HAMILTON]
Honestly, that's why public service
Seems to be calling me.

[BURR AND ENSEMBLE]
He's just
Non-stop!

[HAMILTON]
I practiced the law, I practic'ly perfected it
I've seen injustice in the world and I've corrected it
Now for a strong central democracy
If not, then I'll be Socrates
[HAMILTON]
Throwing verbal rocks
At these mediocrities.

[ENSEMBLE]
Awww!

[BURR]
Hamilton, at the Constitutional Convention:

[HAMILTON]
I was chosen for the Constitutional Convention

[BURR]
There as a New York junior delegate:
[HAMILTON]
Now what I'm going to say may sound indelicate...

[BURR]
Goes and proposes his own form of government!

His own plan for a new form of government!

[COMPANY]
Awwww!

What?

What?

[BURR]
Talks for six hours! The convention is listless!

[ENSEMBLE MAN]
Bright young man...

[ANOTHER ENSEMBLE MAN]
Yo, who the f is this?

[BURR]
Why do you always say what you believe?
Why do you always say what you believe?
Ev'ry proclamation guarantees free ammunition for your enemies!

[BURR AND MEN]
Why do you write like it's
Going out of style?
Write day and night like it's
Going out of style?

[COMPANY]
Why do you always say what you believe?
Awww!

[ALL WOMEN]
Going out of style, hey!
Going out of style, hey!

[BURR AND COMPANY]
Ev'ry day you fight like it's
Going out of style
Do what you do

[BURR]
Alexander?

[HAMILTON]
Aaron Burr, sir

[BURR]
It's the middle of the night

[HAMILTON]
Can we confer, sir?

[BURR]
Is this a legal matter?

HAMILTON
Yes, and it's important to me

[BURR]
What do you need?

[HAMILTON]
Burr, you're a better lawyer than me

[BURR]
Okay

[HAMILTON]
I know I talk too much, I'm abrasive
You're incredible in court. You're succinct, persuasive
My client needs a strong defense. You're the solution

[BURR]
Who's your client?

[HAMILTON]
The new U.S. Constitution?

[BURR]
No

[HAMILTON]
Hear me out

[BURR]
No way!

[HAMILTON]
A series of essays, anonymously published
Defending the document to the public

[BURR]
No one will read it

[HAMILTON]
I disagree

[BURR]
And if it fails?

[HAMILTON]
Burr, that's why we need it

[BURR]
The constitution's a mess

[HAMILTON]
So it needs amendments

[BURR]
It's full of contradictions

[HAMILTON]
So is independence
We have to start somewhere

[BURR]
No. No way

[HAMILTON]
You're making a mistake

[BURR]
Good night

[HAMILTON]
Hey
What are you waiting for?
What do you stall for?

[BURR]
What?

[HAMILTON]
We won the war
What was it all for?
Do you support this constitution?

[BURR]
Of course

[HAMILTON]
Then defend it

[BURR]
And what if you're backing the wrong horse?

[HAMILTON]
Burr, we studied and we fought and we killed
For the notion of a nation we now get to build
For once in your life, take a stand with pride
I don't understand how you stand to the side

[BURR]
I'll keep all my plans
Close to my chest

I'll wait here and see
Which way the wind
Will blow
I'm taking my time
Watching the
Afterbirth of a nation
Watching the tension grow.

[ENSEMBLE]
Wait for it, wait for
It, wait...

Which way the wind
Will blow
I'm taking my time
Watching the
Afterbirth of a nation
Watching the tension grow.

[ANGELICA]
I am sailing off to London. I'm accompanied by someone
Who always pays
I have found a wealthy husband who will keep
Me in comfort for all my days
He is not a lot of fun, but there's no one who
Can match you for turn of phrase
My Alexander

[HAMILTON]
Angelica

[ANGELICA]
Don't forget to write

[ELIZA]
Look at where you are
Look at where you started
The fact that you're alive is a miracle
Just stay alive, that would be enough
And if your wife could share a fraction of your time
If I could grant you peace of mind
Would that be enough?

[BURR]
Alexander joins forces with James Madison and John Jay to write a series of essays defending the new United States Constitution, entitled The Federalist Papers. The plan was to write a total of twenty-five essays, the work divided evenly among the three men. In the end, they wrote eighty-five essays, in the span of six months. John Jay got sick after writing five. James Madison wrote twenty-nine. Hamilton wrote the other fifty-one!

[BURR]
How do you write like you're
Running out of time?
Write day and night like you're
Running out of time?

[BURR AND MEN]
Ev'ry day you fight
Like you're
Running out of time
Like you're
Running out of time
Are you
Running out of time?
[ALL WOMEN]
Running out of time?
Running out of time?
Running out of time
Running out of time
Awwww!

[FULL COMPANY (EXCEPT HAMILTON)]
How do you write like tomorrow won't arrive?
How do you write like you need it to survive?
How do you write ev'ry second you're alive?
Ev'ry second you're alive? Ev'ry second you're alive?

[WASHINGTON]
They are asking me to lead
I am doing the best I can
To get the people that I need
I'm asking you to be my right hand man

[HAMILTON]
Treasury or State?

[WASHINGTON]
I know it's a lot to ask

[HAMILTON]
Treasury or State?

[WASHINGTON]
To leave behind the world you know...

[HAMILTON]
Sir, do you want me to run the Treasury or State department?

[WASHINGTON]
Treasury

[HAMILTON]
Let's go

[ELIZA]
Alexander...

[HAMILTON]
I have to leave

[ELIZA]
Alexander-

[HAMILTON]
Look around, look around at how lucky we are to be alive right now

[ELIZA]
Helpless...

[HAMILTON]
They are asking me to lead

[ELIZA]
Look around, isn't this enough?

How does a bastard, orphan, son of a whore and a
Scotsman, dropped in the middle of a
Forgotten spot in the Caribbean by providence
Impoverished, in squalor
Grow up to be a hero and a scholar?

[LAURENS]
The ten-dollar founding father without a father
Got a lot farther by working a lot harder
By being a lot smarter
By being a self-starter
By fourteen, they placed him in charge of a
Trading charter

[JEFFERSON]
And every day while slaves were being slaughtered and carted
Away across the waves, he struggled and kept his guard up
Inside, he was longing for something to be a part of
The brother was ready to beg, steal, borrow, or barter

[MADISON]
Then a hurricane came, and devastation reigned
Our man saw his future drip, dripping down the drain
Put a pencil to his temple, connected it to his brain
And he wrote his first refrain, a testament to his pain

[BURR]
Well, the word got around, they said, "This kid is insane, man"
Took up a collection just to send him to the mainland
"Get your education, don't forget from whence you came, and
The world is gonna know your name. What's your name, man?"

[HAMILTON]
Alexander Hamilton
My name is Alexander Hamilton
And there's a million things I haven't done
But just you wait, just you wait...

[ELIZA]
When he was ten his father split, full of it, debt-ridden
Two years later, see Alex and his mother bed-ridden
Half-dead sittin in their own sick, the scent thick

[COMPANY]
And Alex got better but his mother went quick

[WASHINGTON]
Moved in with a cousin, the cousin committed suicide
Left him with nothin' but ruined pride, something new inside
A voice saying
[WASHINGTON]
"You gotta fend for yourself." [COMPANY]
"Alex, you gotta fend for yourself."

[WASHINGTON]
He started retreatin' and readin' every treatise on the shelf
[BURR]
There would have been nothin' left to do
For someone less astute
He woulda been dead or destitute
Without a cent of restitution
Started workin', clerkin' for his late mother's landlord
Tradin' sugar cane and rum and all the things he can't afford
Scammin' for every book he can get his hands on
Plannin' for the future see him now as he stands on
The bow of a ship headed for a new land
In New York you can be a new man

[COMPANY]
In New York you can
Be a new man-
In New York you can
Be a new man-

[COMPANY]
Scammin'

Plannin'
Oooh...

Just you wait!

Just you wait!

In New York you can be a new man-

Alexander Hamilton

We are waiting in the wings for you

You could never back down
You never learned to take your time!

Oh, Alexander Hamilton

When America sings for you
Will they know what you overcame?
Will they know you rewrote the game?
The world will never be the same, oh

[BURR]
The ship is in the harbor now
See if you can spot him

Another immigrant
Comin' up from the bottom

His enemies destroyed his rep
America forgot him
[COMPANY]
Alexander Hamilton

Waiting in the wings for you

You never learned to take your time!

Oh, Alexander Hamilton
Alexander Hamilton...
America sings for you
Will they know what you overcame?
Will they know you rewrote the game?
The world will never be the same, oh

[MEN]
Just you wait

Just you wait

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE]
We fought with him

[LAURENS]
Me? I died for him

[WASHINGTON]
Me? I trusted him

[ELIZA/ANGELICA/MARIA]
Me? I loved him

[BURR]
And me? I'm the damn fool that shot him

[COMPANY]
There's a million things I haven't done
But just you wait!

Aaron Burr, Sir

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[COMPANY]
1776. New York City

[HAMILTON]
Pardon me. Are you Aaron Burr, sir?

[BURR]
That depends. Who's asking?

[HAMILTON]
Oh, well, sure, sir
I'm Alexander Hamilton, I'm at your service, sir
I have been looking for you

[BURR]
I'm getting nervous

[HAMILTON]
Sir...
I heard your name at Princeton. I was seeking an accelerated course of study when I got sort of out of sorts with a buddy of yours. I may have punched him. It's a blur, sir. He handles the financials?

[BURR]
You punched the bursar

[HAMILTON]
Yes!
I wanted to do what you did. Graduate in two, then join the revolution. He looked at me like I was stupid, I'm not stupid

So how'd you do it? How'd you graduate so fast?

[BURR]
It was my parents' dying wish before they passed

[HAMILTON]
You're an orphan. Of course! I'm an orphan
God, I wish there was a war!
Then we could prove that we're worth more
Than anyone bargained for...

[BURR]
Can I buy you a drink?

[HAMILTON]
That would be nice

[BURR]
While we're talking, let me offer you some free advice
Talk less

[HAMILTON]
What?

[BURR]
Smile more

[HAMILTON]
Ha

[BURR]
Don't let them know what you're against or what you're for

[HAMILTON]
You can't be serious

[BURR]
You wanna get ahead?

[HAMILTON]
Yes

[BURR]
Fools who run their mouths off wind up dead

[LAURENS]
Yo yo yo yo yo!
What time is it?

[LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
Show time!

[BURR]
...like I said...

[LAURENS]
Show time! Show time! Yo!
I'm John Laurens in the place to be!
Two pints o' Sam Adams, but I'm workin' on three, uh!
Those redcoats don't want it with me!
Cuz I will pop chick-a pop these cops till I'm free!

[LAFAYETTE]
Oui oui, mon ami, je m'appelle Lafayette!
The Lancelot of the revolutionary set!
I came from afar just to say "Bonsoir!"
Tell the King "Casse toi!" Who's the best?
C'est moi!

[MULLIGAN]
Brrrah brraaah! I am Hercules Mulligan
Up in it, lovin' it, yes I heard ya mother said "Come again?"
Lock up ya daughters and horses, of course
It's hard to have intercourse over four sets of corsets...

[LAURENS]
No more sex, pour me another brew, son!
Let's raise a couple more...

[LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
To the revolution!

[LAURENS]
Well, if it ain't the prodigy of Princeton college!

[MULLIGAN]
Aaron Burr!

[LAURENS]
Give us a verse, drop some knowledge!

[BURR]
Good luck with that: you're takin' a stand
You spit. I'm ‘a sit. We'll see where we land

[LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
Boooo!

[LAURENS]
Burr, the revolution's imminent. What do you stall for?

[HAMILTON]
If you stand for nothing, Burr, what'll you fall for?
[LAURENS]
Ooh
Who are you? [MULLIGAN]
Ooh

Who are you? [LAFAYETTE]
Ooh

Who are you?

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE/LAURENS]
Ooh, who is this kid? What's he gonna do?

My Shot

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[HAMILTON]
I am not throwing away my shot!
I am not throwing away my shot!
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot!
I'm ‘a get a scholarship to King's College
I prob'ly shouldn't brag, but dag, I amaze and astonish
The problem is I got a lot of brains but no polish
I gotta holler just to be heard
With every word, I drop knowledge!
I'm a diamond in the rough, a shiny piece of coal
Tryin' to reach my goal. My power of speech: unimpeachable
Only nineteen but my mind is older
These New York City streets get colder, I shoulder
Ev'ry burden, ev'ry disadvantage
I have learned to manage, I don't have a gun to brandish
I walk these streets famished
The plan is to fan this spark into a flame
But damn, it's getting dark, so let me spell out the name
I am the-

[HAMILTON/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN/LAURENS]
A-L-E-X-A-N-D
E-R-we are-meant to be...

[HAMILTON]
A colony that runs independently
Meanwhile, Britain keeps shittin' on us endlessly
Essentially, they tax us relentlessly
Then King George turns around, runs a spending spree
He ain't ever gonna set his descendants free
So there will be a revolution in this century
Enter me!

[LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN/LAURENS]
(He says in parentheses)

[HAMILTON]
Don't be shocked when your hist'ry book mentions me
I will lay down my life if it sets us free
Eventually, you'll see my ascendancy
[HAMILTON]
And I am not throwing away
My shot
I am not throwing away
My shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot
[LAURENS]
My shot!

My shot!

And I'm not throwing away my shot.

[HAMILTON/MULLIGAN/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE]
I am not throwing away my shot
I am not throwing away my shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot
It's time to take a shot!

[LAFAYETTE]
I dream of life without a monarchy
The unrest in France will lead to ‘onarchy?
‘Onarchy? How you say, how you say, ‘anarchy?'
When I fight, I make the other side panicky
With my-

[HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
Shot!

[MULLIGAN]
Yo, I'm a tailor's apprentice
And I got y'all knuckleheads in loco parentis
I'm joining the rebellion cuz I know it's my chance
To socially advance, instead of sewin' some pants!
I'm gonna take a-

[HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
Shot!

[LAURENS]
But we'll never be truly free
Until those in bondage have the same rights as you and me
You and I. Do or die. Wait till I sally in
On a stallion with the first black battalion
Have another-

[HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
Shot!

[BURR]
Geniuses, lower your voices
You keep out of trouble and you double your choices
I'm with you, but the situation is fraught
You've got to be carefully taught:
If you talk, you're gonna get shot!

[HAMILTON]
Burr, check what we got
Mister Lafayette, hard rock like Lancelot
I think your pants look hot
Laurens, I like you a lot
Let's hatch a plot blacker than the kettle callin' the pot...
What are the odds the gods would put us all in one spot
Poppin' a squat on conventional wisdom, like it or not
A bunch of revolutionary manumission abolitionists?
Give me a position, show me where the ammunition is!

Oh, am I talkin' too loud?
Sometimes I get over excited, shoot off at the mouth
I never had a group of friends before
I promise that I'll make y'all proud

[LAURENS]
Let's get this guy in front of a crowd

[HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN/ENSEMBLE]
I am not throwing away my shot
I am not throwing away my shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot

I am not throwing away my shot
I am not throwing away my shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot
[LAURENS]
Ev'rybody sing:
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Hey!
Whoa!
Wooh!!
Whoa!
Ay, let ‘em hear ya!

Let's go!

I said shout it to the rooftops!
Said, to the rooftops!
Come on!

When you're living on your knees, you rise up
Tell your brother that he's gotta rise up
Tell your sister that she's gotta rise up

When are these colonies gonna rise up?
When are these colonies gonna rise up?
When are these colonies gonna rise up?
When are these colonies gonna rise up?

Rise up!
[COMPANY]
Whoa! Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!

Rise up!

[HAMILTON]
I imagine death so much it feels more like a memory
When's it gonna get me?
In my sleep? Seven feet ahead of me?
If I see it comin', do I run or do I let it be?
Is it like a beat without a melody?
See, I never thought I'd live past twenty
Where I come from some get half as many
Ask anybody why we livin' fast and we laugh, reach for a flask
We have to make this moment last, that's plenty

Scratch that
This is not a moment, it's the movement
Where all the hungriest brothers with
Something to prove went?
Foes oppose us, we take an honest stand
We roll like Moses, claimin' our promised land
And? If we win our independence?
‘Zat a guarantee of freedom for our descendants?
Or will the blood we shed begin an endless
Cycle of vengeance and death with no defendants?
I know the action in the street is excitin'
But Jesus, between all the bleedin' ‘n fightin'
I've been readin' ‘n writin'
We need to handle our financial situation
Are we a nation of states? What's the state of our nation?
I'm past patiently waitin'. I'm passionately
Smashin' every expectation
Every action's an act of creation!
I'm laughin' in the face of casualties and sorrow
For the first time, I'm thinkin' past tomorrow

[HAMILTON AND COMPANY]
And I am not throwing away my shot
I am not throwing away my shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot

We're gonna rise up! Time to take a shot!

Schuyler Sisters

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[BURR]
There's nothing rich folks love more
Than going downtown and slummin' it with the poor
They pull up in their carriages and gawk
At the students in the common
Just to watch them talk
Take Philip Schuyler: the man is loaded
Uh-oh, but little does he know that
His daughters, Peggy, Angelica, Eliza
Sneak into the city just to watch all the guys at-

Someone in a rush next to someone lookin' pretty
Excuse me, miss, I know it's not funny
But your perfume smells like your daddy's got money
Why you slummin' in the city in your fancy heels
You searchin for an urchin who can give you ideals?

[ANGELICA]
Burr, you disgust me

[BURR]
Ah, so you've discussed me
I'm a trust fund, baby, you can trust me!

Farmer Refuted

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[SEABURY]
Hear ye, hear ye! My name is Samuel Seabury
And I present "Free Thoughts on the
Proceedings of the Continental Congress!"
Heed not the rabble who scream revolution
They have not your interests at heart

[MULLIGAN]
Oh my God. Tear this dude apart

[SEABURY]
Chaos and bloodshed are not a solution
Don't let them lead you astray
This Congress does not speak for me

[BURR]
Let him be

[SEABURY]
They're playing a dangerous game
I pray the king shows you his mercy
For shame, for shame...
[HAMILTON]
Yo!
He'd have you all unravel at the
Sound of screams but the
Revolution is comin'
The have-nots are gonna
Win this
It's hard to listen to you with a straight face

Chaos and bloodshed already haunt us, honestly you shouldn't even talk. And what about Boston? Look at the cost, n' all that we've lost n' you talk
About Congress?!

My dog speaks more eloquently than thee!

But strangely, your mange is the same

Is he in Jersey?

For the revolution!
[SEABURY]
Heed not the rabble
Who scream
Revolution, they
Have not your
Interests
At heart

Chaos and bloodshed are
Not a
Solution. Don't
Let them lead you
Astray
This Congress does not
Speak for me

They're playing a dangerous game

I pray the king shows you his mercy

For shame

For shame,

[COMPANY]
For the revolution!

[SEABURY]
Heed-

[HAMILTON]
If you repeat yourself again I'm gonna-

[SEABURY/HAMILTON]
Scream-

[HAMILTON]
Honestly, look at me, please don't read!

[SEABURY]
Not your interests-

[HAMILTON]
Don't modulate the key then not debate with me!
Why should a tiny island across the sea regulate the price of tea?

[BURR]
Alexander, please!

[HAMILTON]
Burr, I'd rather be divisive than indecisive, drop the niceties

Silence! A message from the King!

You'll Be Back

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[KING GEORGE]
You say
The price of my love's not a price that you're willing to pay
You cry
In your tea which you hurl in the sea when you see me go by
Why so sad?
Remember we made an arrangement when you went away
Now you're making me mad
Remember, despite our estrangement, I'm your man
You'll be back
Soon you'll see
You'll remember you belong to me
You'll be back
Time will tell
You'll remember that I served you well
Oceans rise
Empires fall
We have seen each other through it all
And when push
Comes to shove
I will send a fully armed battalion
To remind you of my love!

Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da
Da da dat dat da ya da!
Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da
Da da dat dat da...

You say our love is draining and you can't go on
You'll be the one complaining when I am gone...
And no, don't change the subject
Cuz you're my favorite subject
My sweet, submissive subject
My loyal, royal subject
Forever and ever and ever and ever and ever...

You'll be back
Like before
I will fight the fight and win the war
For your love
For your praise
And I'll love you till my dying days
When you're gone
I'll go mad
So don't throw away this thing we had

Cuz when push comes to shove
I will kill your friends and family to remind you of my love
Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da
Da da dat dat da ya da!
Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da
Da da dat-
Everybody!

[ENSEMBLE]
Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da
Da da dat dat da ya da!
Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da da da da

As a kid in the Caribbean I wished for a war
I knew that I was poor
I knew it was the only way to-

[HAMILTON/BURR/MULLIGAN/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE]
Rise up!

[HAMILTON]
If they tell my story
I am either gonna die on the battlefield in glory or-

[HAMILTON/BURR/MULLIGAN/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE]
Rise up!

[HAMILTON]
We will fight for this land
But there's only one man
Who can give us a command so we can-

[HAMILTON/BURR/MULLIGAN/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE]
Rise up!

Understand? It's the only way to-

Outplanned

We gotta make an all out stand
Ayo, I'm gonna need a right-hand man.
ENSEMBLE
What?

What?

Buck, buck, buck, buck, buck!

Buck, buck, buck, buck, buck!

[WASHINGTON]
Check it-
Can I be real a second?
For just a millisecond?
Let down my guard and tell the people how I feel a second?
Now I'm the model of a modern major general
The venerated Virginian veteran whose men are all
Lining up, to put me up on a pedestal
Writin' letters to relatives
Embellishin' my elegance and eloquence
But the elephant is in the room
The truth is in ya face when ya hear the British cannons go...

[ENSEMBLE]
Boom!

[WASHINGTON]
Any hope of success is fleeting
How can I keep leading when the people I'm
Leading keep retreating?
We put a stop to the bleeding as the British take Brooklyn
Knight takes rook, but look
[WASHINGTON]
We are outgunned

Outmanned

Outnumbered
Outplanned

We gotta make an all out stand
Ayo, I'm gonna need a right-hand man

Incoming!
[ENSEMBLE]

Buck, buck, buck, buck, buck!

Buck, buck, buck, buck, buck!

[MULLIGAN]

[HAMILTON]
We gotta stop ‘em and rob ‘em of their advantages

[MULLIGAN]
Rah!

[HAMILTON]
Let's take a stand with the stamina God has granted us
Hamilton won't abandon ship
Yo, let's steal their cannons-
[MULLIGAN]
Shh-boom! [COMPANY]
Boom!

[WASHINGTON]
Goes the cannon, watch the blood and the shit spray and...

[COMPANY]
Boom!

[WASHINGTON]
Goes the cannon, we're abandonin' Kips Bay and...

[COMPANY]
Boom!

[WASHINGTON]
There's another ship and...

[COMPANY]
Boom!

[WASHINGTON]
We just lost the southern tip and...

[COMPANY]
Boom!

[WASHINGTON]
We gotta run to Harlem quick, we can't afford another slip
Guns and horses giddyup
I decide to divvy up
My forces, they're skittish as the British cut the city up
This close to giving up, facing mad scrutiny
I scream in the face of this mass mutiny:
Are these the men with which I am to defend America?
We ride at midnight, Manhattan in the distance
I cannot be everywhere at once, people
I'm in dire need of assistance...

[BURR]
Your excellency, sir!

[WASHINGTON]
Who are you?

[BURR]
Aaron Burr, Sir?
Permission to state my case?

[WASHINGTON]
As you were

[BURR]
Sir
I was a captain under General Montgomery
Until he caught a bullet in the neck in Quebec
And well, in summary
I think that I could be of some assistance
I admire how you keep firing on the British
From a distance

[WASHINGTON]
Huh

[BURR]
I have some questions, a couple of suggestions on how to fight instead of fleeing west

[WASHINGTON]
Yes?

[BURR]
Well-

[HAMILTON]
Your excellency, you wanted to see me?

[WASHINGTON]
Hamilton, come in, have you met Burr?

[HAMILTON]
Yes, sir

[HAMILTON AND BURR]
We keep meeting

[BURR]
As I was saying, sir, I look forward to seeing your strategy play out

[WASHINGTON]
Burr?

[BURR]
Sir?

[WASHINGTON]
Close the door on your way out

[HAMILTON]
Have I done something wrong, sir?

[WASHINGTON]
On the contrary
I called you here because our odds are beyond scary
Your reputation precedes you, but I have to laugh

[HAMILTON]
Sir?

[WASHINGTON]
Hamilton, how come no one can get you on their staff?

[HAMILTON]
Sir!

[WASHINGTON]
Don't get me wrong, you're a young man, of great renown
I know you stole British cannons when we were still downtown
Nathaniel Green and Henry Knox wanted to hire you...

[HAMILTON]
To be their Secretary? I don't think so

[WASHINGTON]
Why're you upset?

[HAMILTON]
I'm not-

[WASHINGTON]
It's alright, you want to fight, you've got a hunger
I was just like you when I was younger
Head full of fantasies of dyin' like a martyr?

[HAMILTON]
Yes

[WASHINGTON]
Dying is easy, young man. Living is harder

[HAMILTON]
Why are you telling me this?

[WASHINGTON]
I'm being honest
I'm working with a third of what our Congress has promised
We are a powder keg about to explode
I need someone like you to lighten the load. So?

[COMPANY (EXCEPT HAMILTON)]
I am not throwin' away my shot!
I am not throwin' away my shot!
Ayo, I'm just like my country, I'm young
Scrappy and hungry!

[HAMILTON]
I am not throwing away my shot!

[WASHINGTON]
Son

[WASHINGON AND COMPANY]
We are outgunned, outmanned!

[HAMILTON]
You need all the help you can get
I have some friends. Laurens, Mulligan
Marquis de Lafayette, okay, what else?

[WASHINGTON AND COMPANY]
Outnumbered, outplanned!

[HAMILTON]
We'll need some spies on the inside
Some King's men who might let some things slide
[HAMILTON]
I'll write to Congress and tell ‘em we need supplies, you rally the guys, master the element of surprise

I'll rise above my station, organize your information, ‘til we rise to the occasion of our new nation. Sir!

[ENSEMBLE]
Here comes the General!

A Winter's Ball

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[BURR]
How does the bastard, orphan, son of a whore
Go on and on
Grow into more of a phenomenon?
Watch this obnoxious, arrogant, loudmouth bother
Be seated at the right hand of the father
Washington hires Hamilton right on sight
But Hamilton still wants to fight, not write
Now Hamilton's skill with a quill is undeniable
But what do we have in common? We're
Reliable with the

[ALL MEN]
Ladies!

[BURR]
There are so many to deflower!

[ALL MEN]
Ladies!

[ELIZA AND WOMEN]
Helpless!
Look into your eyes, and the sky's the limit I'm helpless!
Down for the count, and I'm drownin' in ‘em

[ELIZA]
I have never been the type to try and grab the spotlight
We were at a revel with some rebels on a hot night
Laughin' at my sister as she's dazzling the room
Then you walked in and my heart went "Boom!"
Tryin' to catch your eye from the side of the ballroom
Everybody's dancin' and the band's top volume

[ELIZA AND WOMEN]
Grind to the rhythm as we wine and dine
[ELIZA]
Grab my sister, and
Whisper, "Yo, this
One's mine."

My sister made her way across the room to you
And I got nervous, thinking "What's she gonna do?"
She grabbed you by the arm, I'm thinkin' "I'm through"
Then you look back at me and suddenly I'm
Helpless!

Oh, look at those eyes

Oh!
Yeah, I'm
Helpless, I know

I'm so into you
I am so into you

I know I'm down for the count
And I'm drownin' in ‘em.

Then by all means, lead the way

[ELIZA]
Elizabeth Schuyler. It's a pleasure to meet you

[HAMILTON]
Schuyler?

[ANGELICA]
My sister

[ELIZA]
Thank you for all your service

[HAMILTON]
If it takes fighting a war for us to meet, it will have been worth it

[ANGELICA]
I'll leave you to it

[ELIZA AND WOMEN]
One week later

[ELIZA]
I'm writin' a letter nightly
Now my life gets better, every letter that you write me
Laughin' at my sister, cuz she wants to form a harem

[ANGELICA]
I'm just sayin', if you really loved me, you would share him
[ELIZA]
Ha!
Two weeks later
In the living room stressin'
My father's stone-faced
While you're asking for his blessin'
I'm dying inside, as
You wine
And dine
And I'm tryin' not to cry
‘cause there's nothing that your mind can't do
My father makes his way across the room
To you
I panic for a second, thinking
"we're through"
But then he shakes your hand and says
"Be true"
And you turn back to me, smiling, and I'm
Helpless!

Helpless!
Hoo!

That boy is mine
That boy is mine!

Helpless! Helpless!
Down for the count
And I'm drownin' in em

Look into your eyes
And the sky's the
Limit I'm

Down for the count
And I'm drownin' in em

[HAMILTON]
Eliza, I don't have a dollar to my name
An acre of land, a troop to command, a dollop of fame
All I have's my honor, a tolerance for pain
A couple of college credits and my top-notch brain
Insane, your family brings out a different side of me
Peggy confides in me, Angelica tried to take a bite of me
No stress, my love for you is never in doubt
We'll get a little place in Harlem and we'll figure it out
I've been livin' without a family since I was a child
My father left, my mother died, I grew up buckwild
But I'll never forget my mother's face, that was real
And long as I'm alive, Eliza, swear to God
You'll never feel so...

[HAMILTON]
Eliza...

I've never felt so-

My life is gon' be fine cuz Eliza's in it.
[ELIZA]
I do I do I do I do!

I do I do I do I do!

Hey, yeah, yeah!

I'm down for the count
I'm-

I look into your eyes, and the sky's the limit
I'm

I remember that night, I just might
Regret that night for the rest of my days

I remember those soldier boys
Tripping over themselves to win our praise

I remember that dreamlike candlelight
Like a dream that you can't quite place

But Alexander, I'll never forget the first
Time I saw your face

I have never been the same
Intelligent eyes in a hunger-pang frame
And when you said "Hi," I forgot my dang name
Set my heart aflame, ev'ry part aflame

[FULL COMPANY]
This is not a game...

[HAMILTON]
You strike me as a woman who has never been satisfied

[ANGELICA]
I'm sure I don't know what you mean. You forget yourself

[HAMILTON]
You're like me. I'm never satisfied

[ANGELICA]
Is that right?

[HAMILTON]
I have never been satisfied

[ANGELICA]
My name is Angelica Schuyler

[HAMILTON]
Alexander Hamilton

[ANGELICA]
Where's your fam'ly from?

[HAMILTON]
Unimportant. There's a million things I haven't done but
Just you wait, just you wait...

So so so-
So this is what it feels like to match wits
With someone at your level! What the hell is the catch? It's
The feeling of freedom, of seein' the light
It's Ben Franklin with a key and a kite! You see it, right?
The conversation lasted two minutes, maybe three minutes
Ev'rything we said in total agreement, it's
A dream and it's a bit of a dance
A bit of a posture, it's a bit of a stance. He's a
Bit of a flirt, but I'm ‘a give it a chance
I asked about his fam'ly, did you see his answer?
His hands started fidgeting, he looked askance?
He's penniless, he's flying by the seat of his pants

Handsome, boy, does he know it!
Peach fuzz, and he can't even grow it!
I wanna take him far away from this place
Then I turn and see my sister's face and she is...

[ELIZA]
Helpless...

[ANGELICA]
And I know she is...

[ELIZA]
Helpless...

[ANGELICA]
And her eyes are just...

[ELIZA]
Helpless...

[ANGELICA]
And I realize

[ANGELICA AND COMPANY]
Three fundamental truths at the exact same time...

[HAMILTON]
Where are you taking me?

[ANGELICA]
I'm about to change your life

[HAMILTON]
Then by all means, lead the way

[COMPANY (EXCEPT ANGELICA)]
Number one!

[ANGELICA]
I'm a girl in a world in which
My only job is to marry rich
My father has no sons so I'm the one
Who has to social climb for one
So I'm the oldest and the wittiest and the gossip in
New York City is insidious
Alexander is penniless
Ha! That doesn't mean I want him any less

[ELIZA]
Elizabeth Schuyler. It's a pleasure to meet you

[HAMILTON]
Schuyler?

[ANGELICA]
My sister

[COMPANY]
Number two!

[ANGELICA]
He's after me cuz I'm a Schuyler sister
That elevates his status, I'd
Have to be naïve to set that aside
Maybe that is why I introduce him to Eliza
Now that's his bride
Nice going, Angelica, he was right
You will never be satisfied

[ELIZA]
Thank you for all your service

[HAMILTON]
If it takes fighting a war for us to meet, it will have been worth it

[ANGELICA]
I'll leave you to it

[COMPANY]
Number three!

[ANGELICA]
I know my sister like I know my own mind
You will never find anyone as trusting or as kind
If I tell her that I love him she'd be silently resigned
He'd be mine
She would say, "I'm fine"

[ANGELICA AND COMPANY]
She'd be lying

[ANGELICA]
But when I fantasize at night
It's Alexander's eyes
As I romanticize what might
Have been if I hadn't sized him
Up so quickly
At least my dear Eliza's his wife;
At least I keep his eyes in my life...
[ANGELICA]
To the groom!

To the bride!

From your sister

Who is always by your side

To your union

And the hope that you provide

May you always

Be satisfied

And I know

She'll be happy as

His bride
And I know [ALL MEN (EXCEPT HAMILTON)]
To the groom!
To the groom!
To the groom!

To the bride!
To the bride!

Angelica!
Angelica!

By your side

To the union!
To the revolution!

You provide!
You provide!

[HAMILTON AND MEN]
Always-

Be satisfied

Be satisfied

[MEN]
Be satisfied
Be satisfied
Be satisfied
Be satisfied

Be satisfied
Be satisfied

Be satisfied
Be satisfied
Be satisfied
Be satisfied.

[ALL WOMEN (EXCEPT ELIZA)]
To the groom!

To the bride!

To the bride!

[ELIZA AND WOMEN]
Angelica!

By your side

To the union!
To the revolution!

You provide!

Always-

Be satisfied

[WOMEN]
Be satisfied

Be satisfied

Be satisfied.

[ANGELICA]
He will never be satisfied
I will never be satisfied

The Story of Tonight (Reprise)

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[LAURENS]
I may not live to see our glory!

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE]
I may not live to see our glory!

[LAURENS]
But I've seen wonders great and small

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE]
I've seen wonders great and small

[LAURENS]
‘Cause if the tomcat can get married

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE]
If Alexander can get married-

[LAURENS]
There's hope for our ass, after all!

[LAFAYETTE]
Raise a glass to freedom

[LAURENS/MULLIGAN]
Hey!
Something you will never see again!

[MULLIGAN]
No matter what she tells you

[LAFAYETTE]
Let's have another round tonight!

[LAURENS]
Raise a glass to the four of us!

[LAFAYETTE/HAMILTON]
Ho!

[MULLIGAN]
To the newly not poor of us!

[LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/HAMILTON]
Woo!

[LAFAYETTE]
We'll tell the story of tonight

[LAURENS]
Let's have another round-

[HAMILTON]
Well, if it isn't Aaron Burr

[BURR]
Sir!

[HAMILTON]
I didn't think that you would make it

[BURR]
To be sure

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE]
Burr!

[BURR]
I came to say congratulations

[MULLIGAN]
Spit a verse, Burr!

[BURR]
I see the whole gang is here

[LAFAYETTE]
You are the worst, Burr!

[HAMILTON]
Ignore them. Congrats to you, Lieutenant Colonel
I wish I had your command instead of manning George's journal

[BURR]
No, you don't

[HAMILTON]
Yes, I do

[BURR]
Now, be sensible
From what I hear, you've made yourself indispensable

[LAURENS]
Well, well, I heard
You've got a special someone on the side, Burr

[HAMILTON]
Is that so?

[LAURENS]
What are you tryin' to hide, Burr?

[BURR]
I should go

[HAMILTON]
No, these guys should go

[LAFAYETTE]
What?

[LAURENS]
No!

[HAMILTON]
Leave us alone

[MULLIGAN]
Man...

[HAMILTON]
It's alright, Burr. I wish you'd brought this girl with you tonight, Burr

[BURR]
You're very kind, but I'm afraid it's unlawful, sir

[HAMILTON]
What do you mean?

[BURR]
She's married

[HAMILTON]
I see

[BURR]
She's married to a British officer

[HAMILTON]
Oh shit...

[BURR]
Congrats again, Alexander. Smile more
I'll see you on the other side of the war

[HAMILTON]
I will never understand you
If you love this woman, go get her! What are you waiting for?

[BURR]
I'll see you on the other side of the war

[HAMILTON]
I'll see you on the other side of the war

Wait For It

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[BURR]
Theodosia writes me a letter everyday
I'm keeping the bed warm while her husband is away
He's on the British side in Georgia
He's trying to keep the colonies in line
But he can keep all of Georgia
Theodosia, she's mine

Love doesn't discriminate
Between the sinners
And the saints
It takes and it takes and it takes
And we keep loving anyway
We laugh and we cry
And we break
And we make our mistakes
And if there's a reason I'm by her side
When so many have tried
Then I'm willing to wait for it
I'm willing to wait for it
[BURR]
My grandfather was a fire and brimstone preacher

But there are things that the
Homilies and hymns won't teach ya

My mother was a genius

My father commanded respect

When they died they left no instructions
Just a legacy to protect

[MEN]
Preacher, preacher
Preacher

Teach ya, teach ya, teach ya

Respect, respect

[WOMEN]
Genius

[BURR/ENSEMBLE]
Death doesn't discriminate
Between the sinners
And the saints
It takes and it takes and it takes
And we keep living anyway
We rise and we fall
And we break
And we make our mistakes
And if there's a reason I'm still alive
When everyone who loves me has died
I'm willing to wait for it
I'm willing to wait for it

Wait for it

[ENSEMBLE]
Wait for it
Wait for it
Wait for it

[BURR]
I am the one thing in life I can control

[ENSEMBLE]
Wait for it

I am inimitable
I am an original

[ENSEMBLE]
Wait for it

[BURR]
I'm not falling behind or running late

[ENSEMBLE]
Wait for it
Wait for it

[BURR]
I'm not standing still
I am lying in wait

[ENSEMBLE]
Wait
Wait

[BURR]
Hamilton faces an endless uphill climb

[ENSEMBLE]
Climb
Climb
Climb

[BURR]
He has something to prove
He has nothing to lose

[ENSEMBLE]
Lose
Lose
Lose
Lose

[BURR]
Hamilton's pace is relentless
He wastes no time

[ENSEMBLE]
Time
Time
Time

[BURR]
What is it like in his shoes?

Hamilton doesn't hesitate
He exhibits no restraint
He takes and he takes and he takes
And he keeps winning anyway
He changes the game
He plays and he raises the stakes
And if there's a reason
He seems to thrive when so few survive, then Goddamnit-
[BURR]
I'm willing to wait for it

I'm willing to wait for it...

Life doesn't discriminate
Between the sinners and the saints
It takes and it takes and it takes

We rise
We fall

And if there's a reason I'm still alive
When so many have died
Then I'm willin' to-
[COMPANY]
I'm willing to wait for it
Wait for it

Life doesn't discriminate
Between the sinners and the saints
It takes and it takes and it takes
And we keep living anyway
We rise and we fall and we break

And if there's a reason I'm still alive
When so many have died
Then I'm willin' to-

Stay Alive

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[ELIZA]
Stay alive...

[ELIZA/ANGELICA/ENSEMBLE WOMEN]
Stay alive...

[HAMILTON]
I have never seen the General so despondent
I have taken over writing all his correspondence
Congress writes, "George, attack the British forces."
I shoot back, we have resorted to eating our horses
Local merchants deny us equipment, assistance
They only take British money, so sing a song of sixpence

[WASHINGTON]
The cavalry's not coming

[HAMILTON]
Sir!

[WASHINGTON]
Alex, listen. There's only one way for us to win this
Provoke outrage, outright

[HAMILTON]
That's right

[WASHINGTON]
Don't engage, strike by night
Remain relentless ‘til their troops take flight

[HAMILTON]
Make it impossible to justify the cost of the fight

[WASHINGTON]
Outrun

[HAMILTON]
Outrun

[WASHINGTON]
Outlast

[HAMILTON]
Outlast

[WASHINGTON]
Hit ‘em quick, get out fast

[HAMILTON]
Chick-a-plao!

[WASHINGTON]
Stay alive ‘til this horror show is past
We're gonna fly a lot of flags half-mast

[HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE]
Raise a glass!

[MULLIGAN]
I go back to New York and my apprenticeship

[LAFAYETTE]
I ask for French aid, I pray that France has sent a ship

[LAURENS]
I stay at work with Hamilton
We write essays against slavery
And every day's a test of our camaraderie
And bravery

[HAMILTON]
We cut supply lines, we steal contraband
We pick and choose our battles and places to take a stand
And ev'ry day
"Sir, entrust me with a command,"
And ev'ry day

[WASHINGTON]
No

[HAMILTON]
He dismisses me out of hand
[HAMILTON]
Instead of me
He promotes
Charles Lee
Makes him second-in-command:

[LEE]
Charles Lee. [ELIZA/ANGELICA]
Stay alive...

[LEE]
I'm a General. Whee!!!!

[HAMILTON]
Yeah. He's not the choice I would have gone with

[HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE]
He shits the bed at the Battle of Monmouth

[WASHINGTON]
Ev'ryone attack!

[LEE]
Retreat!

[WASHINGTON]
Attack!

[LEE]
Retreat!

[WASHINGTON]
What are you doing, Lee? Get back on your feet!

[LEE]
But there's so many of them!

[WASHINGTON]
I'm sorry, is this not your speed?!
Hamilton!

[HAMILTON]
Ready, sir!

[WASHINGTON]
Have Lafayette take the lead!

[HAMILTON]
Yes, sir!

[LAURENS]
A thousand soldiers die in a hundred degree heat

[LAFAYETTE]
As we snatch a stalemate from the jaws of defeat

[HAMILTON]
Charles Lee was left behind
Without a pot to piss in
He started sayin' this to anybody who would listen:

[LEE]
Washington cannot be left alone to his devices
Indecisive, from crisis to crisis
The best thing he can do for the revolution
Is turn n' go back to plantin' tobacco in Mount Vernon

[COMPANY]
Oo!!

[WASHINGTON]
Don't do a thing. History will prove him wrong

[HAMILTON]
But, sir!

[WASHINGTON]
We have a war to fight, let's move along

[LAURENS]
Strong words from Lee, someone oughta hold him to it

[HAMILTON]
I can't disobey direct orders

[LAURENS]
Then I'll do it
Alexander, you're the closest friend I've got

[HAMILTON]
Laurens, do not throw away your shot

Ten Duel Commandments

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[MEN]
One, two, three, four

[FULL COMPANY]
Five, six, seven, eight, nine...

[BURR/HAMILTON/LAURENS/LEE]
It's the Ten Duel Commandments

[FULL COMPANY]
It's the Ten Duel Commandments
Number one!

[LAURENS]
The challenge: demand satisfaction
If they apologize, no need for further action

[COMPANY]
Number two!

[LAURENS]
If they don't, grab a friend, that's your second

[HAMILTON]
Your lieutenant when there's reckoning to be reckoned

[COMPANY]
Number three!

[LEE]
Have your seconds meet face to face

[BURR]
Negotiate a peace...

[HAMILTON]
Or negotiate a time and place

[BURR]
This is commonplace, ‘specially ‘tween recruits

[COMPANY]
Most disputes die, and no one shoots
Number four!

[LAURENS]
If they don't reach a peace, that's alright
Time to get some pistols and a doctor on site

[HAMILTON]
You pay him in advance, you treat him with civility

[BURR]
You have him turn around so he can have deniability

[COMPANY]
Five!

[LEE]
Duel before the sun is in the sky

[COMPANY]
Pick a place to die where it's high and dry
Number six!

[HAMILTON]
Leave a note for your next of kin
Tell ‘em where you been. Pray that hell or heaven lets you in

[COMPANY]
Seven!

[LEE]
Confess your sins. Ready for the moment of adrenaline when you finally face your opponent

[COMPANY]
Number eight!

[LAURENS/LEE/HAMILTON/BURR]
Your last chance to negotiate
Send in your seconds, see if they can set the record straight...

[BURR]
Alexander

[HAMILTON]
Aaron Burr, sir

[BURR]
Can we agree that duels are dumb and immature?

[HAMILTON]
Sure
But your man has to answer for his words, Burr

[BURR]
With his life? We both know that's absurd, sir

[HAMILTON]
Hang on, how many men died because Lee was inexperienced and ruinous?

[BURR]
Okay, so we're doin' this

[COMPANY]
Number nine!

[HAMILTON]
Look ‘em in the eye, aim no higher
Summon all the courage you require
Then count

[MEN]
One two three four

[FULL COMPANY]
Five six seven eight nine

[HAMILTON/BURR]
Number

[COMPANY]
Ten paces!

[HAMILTON/BURR]
Fire!

Meet Me Inside

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[HAMILTON]
Lee, do you yield?

[BURR]
You shot him in the side!
Yes, he yields!

[LAURENS]
I'm satisfied

[BURR]
Yo, we gotta clear the field!

[HAMILTON]
Go! We won

[COMPANY]
Here comes the General!

[BURR]
This should be fun

[WASHINGTON]
What is the meaning of this? Mr. Burr, get a medic for the General

[BURR]
Yes, sir

[WASHINGTON]
Lee, you will never agree with me
But believe me, these young men don't speak for me
Thank you for your service

[BURR]
Let's ride!

[WASHINGTON]
Hamilton!

[HAMILTON]
Sir!

[WASHINGTON]
Meet me inside

[COMPANY]
Meet him inside! Meet him inside!
Meet him inside, meet him, meet him inside!

[WASHINGTON]
Son-

[HAMILTON]
Don't call me son

[WASHINGTON]
This war is hard enough
Without infighting-

[HAMILTON]
Lee called you out. We called his bluff

[WASHINGTON]
You solve nothing, you aggravate our allies to the south

[HAMILTON]
You're absolutely right, John should have shot him in the mouth
That would've shut him up

[WASHINGTON]
Son-

[HAMILTON]
I'm notcha son-

[WASHINGTON]
Watch your tone
I am not a maiden in need of defending, I am grown

[HAMILTON (OVERLAPPING)]
Charles Lee, Thomas Conway
These men take your name and they rake it
Through the mud

[WASHINGTON]
My name's been through a lot, I can take it

[HAMILTON]
Well, I don't have your name. I don't have your titles
I don't have your land
But, if you-

[WASHINGTON]
No-

[HAMILTON]
If you gave me command of a battalion, a group of men to lead, I could fly above my station after the war

[WASHINGTON]
Or you could die and we need you alive

[HAMILTON]
I'm more than willing to die-

[WASHINGTON]
Your wife needs you alive, son, I need you alive-

[HAMILTON]
Call me son one more time-

[WASHINGTON]
Go home, Alexander
That's an order from your commander

[HAMILTON]
Sir-

[WASHINGTON]
Go home

That Would Be Enough

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[ELIZA]
Look around, look around at how lucky we are
To be alive right now
Look around, look around...

[HAMILTON]
How long have you known?

[ELIZA]
A month or so

[HAMILTON]
Eliza, you should have told me

[ELIZA]
I wrote to the General a month ago

[HAMILTON]
No

[ELIZA]
I begged him to send you home

[HAMILTON]
You should have told me

[ELIZA]
I'm not sorry
[ELIZA]
I knew you'd fight
Until the war was won

But you deserve a chance to meet your son
Look around, look around at how lucky we are
To be alive right now.
[HAMILTON]
The war's not
Done.

[HAMILTON]
Will you relish being a poor man's wife
Unable to provide for your life?

[ELIZA]
I relish being your wife
Look around, look around...

Look at where you are
Look at where you started
The fact that you're alive is a miracle
Just stay alive, that would be enough

And if this child
Shares a fraction of your smile
Or a fragment of your mind, look out world!
That would be enough

I don't pretend to know
The challenges you're facing
The worlds you keep erasing and creating in your mind

But I'm not afraid
I know who I married
So long as you come home at the end of the day
That would be enough

We don't need a legacy
We don't need money
If I could grant you peace of mind

If you could let me inside your heart...
Oh, let me be a part of the narrative
In the story they will write someday
Let this moment be the first chapter:
Where you decide to stay
And I could be enough
And we could be enough
That would be enough

Guns and Ships

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[BURR]
How does a ragtag volunteer army in need of a shower
Somehow defeat a global superpower?
How do we emerge victorious from the quagmire?
Leave the battlefield waving Betsy Ross' flag higher?
Yo. Turns out we have a secret weapon!
An immigrant you know and love who's unafraid to step in!
He's constantly confusin', confoundin' the British henchmen
Ev'ryone give it up for America's favorite fighting Frenchman!

[COMPANY]
Lafayette!

[LAFAYETTE]
I'm takin this horse by the reins makin'
Redcoats redder with bloodstains

[COMPANY]
Lafayette!

[LAFAYETTE]
And I'm never gonna stop until I make ‘em
Drop and burn ‘em up and scatter their remains, I'm

[COMPANY]
Lafayette!

[LAFAYETTE]
Watch me engagin' em! Escapin' em!
Enragin' em! I'm-

[COMPANY]
Lafayette!

[LAFAYETTE]
I go to France for more funds

[COMPANY]
Lafayette!

[LAFAYETTE]
I come back with more

[LAFAYETTE AND ENSEMBLE]
Guns
And ships
And so the balance shifts

[WASHINGTON]
We rendezvous with Rochambeau, consolidate their gifts

[LAFAYETTE]
We can end this war at Yorktown, cut them off at sea, but
For this to succeed, there's someone else we need:

[WASHINGTON]
I know

[WASHINGTON AND COMPANY]
Hamilton!

[LAFAYETTE]
Sir, he knows what to do in a trench
Ingenuitive and fluent in French, ami-

[WASHINGTON AND COMPANY]
Hamilton!

[LAFAYETTE]
Sir, you're gonna have to use him eventually
What's he gonna do on the bench? I mean-

[WASHINGTON AND COMPANY]
Hamilton!

[LAFAYETTE]
No one has more resilience
Or matches my practical tactical brilliance-

[WASHINGTON AND COMPANY]
Hamilton!
[LAFAYETTE]
You wanna fight for your land back?

[WASHINGTON]
I need my right hand man back!

[LAFAYETTE]
Ah! Uh, get ya right hand man back
You know you gotta get ya right hand man back

I mean you gotta put some thought into the letter but the sooner the better
To get your right hand man back!

[COMPANY]
Hamilton!

[WOMEN]
Hamilton!

Hamilton!

Hamilton, Hamilton!
Ha- ha-!

[MEN]
Get your right hand man back!

Your right hand man back!

Hamilton!
Ha-
Ha-

Hamilton, Hamilton!
Ha- ha-!

[WASHINGTON]
Alexander Hamilton
Troops are waiting in the field for you
If you join us right now, together we can turn the tide
Oh, Alexander Hamilton
I have soldiers who will yield for you
If we manage to get this right
They'll surrender by early light
The world will never be the same, Alexander...

History Has Its Eyes On You

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[WASHINGTON]
I was younger than you are now
When I was given my first command
I led my men straight into a massacre
I witnessed their deaths firsthand
I made every mistake
I felt the shame rise in me
And even now I lie awake
[WASHINGTON]
Knowing history has its eyes on me

[HAMILTON/WASHINGTON]
History has its eyes on me. [LAURENS/MULLIGAN]
Whoa...
Whoa...
Whoa...
Yeah

[COMPANY]
Whoa...
Whoa...
Whoa...
Yeah

[WASHINGTON]
Let me tell you what I wish I'd known
When I was young and dreamed of glory:
You have no control:

[WASHINGTON AND COMPANY]
Who lives, who dies, who tells your story

[WASHINGTON]
I know that we can win
I know that greatness lies in you
But remember from here on in
[WASHINGTON/HAMILTON AND MEN]
History has its
Eyes on you.

[ENSEMBLE]
Whoa...

Yorktown (The World Turned Upside Down)

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[COMPANY]
The battle of Yorktown. 1781

[LAFAYETTE]
Monsieur Hamilton

[HAMILTON]
Monsieur Lafayette

[LAFAYETTE]
In command where you belong

[HAMILTON]
How you say, no sweat
We're finally on the field. We've had quite a run

[LAFAYETTE]
Immigrants:

[HAMILTON/LAFAYETTE]
We get the job done

[HAMILTON]
So what happens if we win?

[LAFAYETTE]
I go back to France
I bring freedom to my people if I'm given the chance

[HAMILTON]
We'll be with you when you do

[LAFAYETTE]
Go lead your men

[HAMILTON]
See you on the other side

[LAFAYETTE]
‘Til we meet again, let's go!

[ENSEMBLE]
I am not throwin' away my shot!
I am not throwin' away my shot!
Hey yo, I'm just like my country, I'm young
Scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwin' away my shot!
I am not throwin' away my shot!

[HAMILTON]
‘Til the world turns upside down...

[ENSEMBLE]
‘Til the world turns upside down!

[HAMILTON]
I imagine death so much it feels more like a memory
This is where it gets me: on my feet
The enemy ahead of me
If this is the end of me, at least I have a friend with me
Weapon in my hand, a command, and my men with me
Then I remember my Eliza's expecting me...
Not only that, my Eliza's expecting
We gotta go, gotta get the job done
Gotta start a new nation, gotta meet my son!
Take the bullets out your gun!

[ENSEMBLE]
What?

[HAMILTON]
The bullets out your gun!

[ENSEMBLE]
What?

[HAMILTON]
We move under cover and we move as one
Through the night, we have one shot to live another day
We cannot let a stray gunshot give us away
We will fight up close, seize the moment and stay in it
It's either that or meet the business end of a bayonet
The code word is ‘Rochambeau,' dig me?

[ENSEMBLE]
Rochambeau!

[HAMILTON]
You have your orders now, go, man, go!
And so the American experiment begins
With my friends all scattered to the winds
Laurens is in South Carolina, redefining brav'ry

[HAMILTON/LAURENS]
We'll never be free until we end slavery!

[HAMILTON]
When we finally drive the British away
Lafayette is there waiting-

[HAMILTON/LAFAYETTE]
In Chesapeake Bay!

[HAMILTON]
How did we know that this plan would work?
We had a spy on the inside. That's right

[HAMILTON/COMPANY]
Hercules Mulligan!

[MULLIGAN]
A tailor spyin' on the British government!
I take their measurements, information and then I smuggle it

[COMPANY]
Up

[MULLIGAN]
To my brother's revolutionary covenant
I'm runnin' with the Sons of Liberty and I am lovin' it!
See, that's what happens when you up against the ruffians
We in the shit now, somebody gotta shovel it!
Hercules Mulligan, I need no introduction
When you knock me down I get the fuck back up again!

[COMPANY]
Left! Right! Hold!
Go!
What! What! What!

[HAMILTON]
After a week of fighting, a young man in a red coat stands on a parapet

[LAFAYETTE]
We lower our guns as he frantically waves a white handkerchief

[MULLIGAN]
And just like that, it's over. We tend to our wounded, we count our dead

[LAURENS]
Black and white soldiers wonder alike if this really means freedom

[WASHINGTON]
Not. Yet

[HAMILTON]
We negotiate the terms of surrender
I see George Washington smile
We escort their men out of Yorktown
They stagger home single file
Tens of thousands of people flood the streets
There are screams and church bells ringing
And as our fallen foes retreat
I hear the drinking song they're singing...

[ALL MEN]
The world turned upside down

[FULL COMPANY]
The world turned upside down
The world turned upside down
The world turned upside down
Down
Down, down, down

[LAFAYETTE]
Freedom for America, freedom for France!

Gotta start a new nation
Gotta meet my son

What Comes Next

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[KING GEORGE]
They say
The price of my war's not a price that they're willing to pay
Insane
You cheat with the French, now I'm fighting with France and with Spain
I'm so blue
I thought that we'd made an arrangement
When you went away
You were mine to subdue
Well, even despite our estrangement, I've got
A small query for you:

What comes next?
You've been freed
Do you know how hard it is to lead?

You're on your own
Awesome. Wow
Do you have a clue what happens now?

Oceans rise
Empires fall
It's much harder when it's all your call

All alone, across the sea
When your people say they hate you, don't
Come crawling back to me

Da da da dat da dat da da da
Da ya da
Da da dat
Da da ya da...

You're on your own...

Dear Theodosia

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[BURR]
Dear Theodosia, what to say to you?
You have my eyes. You have your mother's name

When you came into the world, you cried and it broke my heart

I'm dedicating every day to you
Domestic life was never quite my style
When you smile, you knock me out, I fall apart
And I thought I was so smart

You will come of age with our young nation
We'll bleed and fight for you, we'll make it right for you
If we lay a strong enough foundation
We'll pass it on to you, we'll give the world to you
And you'll blow us all away...
Someday, someday
Yeah, you'll blow us all away
Someday, someday

[HAMILTON]
Oh Philip, when you smile I am undone
My son
Look at my son. Pride is not the word I'm looking for

There is so much more inside me now
Oh Philip, you outshine the morning sun
My son
When you smile, I fall apart
And I thought I was so smart
My father wasn't around

[BURR]
My father wasn't around
[HAMILTON]
I swear that
I'll be around for you.
[BURR]
I'll be around for you.

[HAMILTON]
I'll do whatever it takes

[BURR]
I'll make a million mistakes

[BURR/HAMILTON]
I'll make the world safe and sound for you...
...will come of age with our young nation
We'll bleed and fight for you, we'll make it right for you

If we lay a strong enough foundation
We'll pass it on to you, we'll give the world to you
And you'll blow us all away...
Someday, someday
Yeah, you'll blow us all away
Someday, someday

Non-Stop

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[BURR]
After the war I went back to New York

[HAMILTON]
A-After the war I went back to New York

[BURR]
I finished up my studies and I practiced law

[HAMILTON]
I practiced law, Burr worked next door
[BURR]
Even though we started at the very same time
Alexander Hamilton began to climb
How to account for his rise to the top?
Maaaaan, the man is
Non-stop!

[ENSEMBLE]
Non-stop!

[HAMILTON]
Gentlemen of the jury, I'm curious, bear with me
Are you aware that we're making hist'ry?
This is the first murder trial of our brand-new nation
[HAMILTON]
The liberty behind
Deliberation-

[ENSEMBLE]
Non-stop!

[HAMILTON]
I intend to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt
With my assistant counsel-

[BURR]
Co-counsel
Hamilton, sit down
Our client Levi Weeks is innocent. Call your first witness
That's all you had to say!

[HAMILTON]
Okay!
One more thing-

[BURR]
Why do you assume you're the smartest in the room?
Why do you assume you're the smartest in the room?
Why do you assume you're the smartest in the room?
Soon that attitude may be your doom!

[ENSEMBLE]
Awwww!

[BURR]
Why do you write like you're running out of time?
Write day and night like you're running out of time?
Ev'ry day you fight, like you're running out of time

Keep on fighting. In the meantime- [ENSEMBLE]
Why do you write like you're running out of time?

Ev'ry day you fight, like you're running out of time

Non-stop!

[HAMILTON]
Corruption's such an old song that we can sing along in harmony
And nowhere is it stronger than in Albany
This colony's economy's increasingly stalling and

[HAMILTON]
Honestly, that's why public service
Seems to be calling me.

[BURR AND ENSEMBLE]
He's just
Non-stop!

[HAMILTON]
I practiced the law, I practic'ly perfected it
I've seen injustice in the world and I've corrected it
Now for a strong central democracy
If not, then I'll be Socrates
[HAMILTON]
Throwing verbal rocks
At these mediocrities.

[ENSEMBLE]
Awww!

[BURR]
Hamilton, at the Constitutional Convention:

[HAMILTON]
I was chosen for the Constitutional Convention

[BURR]
There as a New York junior delegate:
[HAMILTON]
Now what I'm going to say may sound indelicate...

[BURR]
Goes and proposes his own form of government!

His own plan for a new form of government!

[COMPANY]
Awwww!

What?

What?

[BURR]
Talks for six hours! The convention is listless!

[ENSEMBLE MAN]
Bright young man...

[ANOTHER ENSEMBLE MAN]
Yo, who the f is this?

[BURR]
Why do you always say what you believe?
Why do you always say what you believe?
Ev'ry proclamation guarantees free ammunition for your enemies!

[BURR AND MEN]
Why do you write like it's
Going out of style?
Write day and night like it's
Going out of style?

[COMPANY]
Why do you always say what you believe?
Awww!

[ALL WOMEN]
Going out of style, hey!
Going out of style, hey!

[BURR AND COMPANY]
Ev'ry day you fight like it's
Going out of style
Do what you do

[BURR]
Alexander?

[HAMILTON]
Aaron Burr, sir

[BURR]
It's the middle of the night

[HAMILTON]
Can we confer, sir?

[BURR]
Is this a legal matter?

HAMILTON
Yes, and it's important to me

[BURR]
What do you need?

[HAMILTON]
Burr, you're a better lawyer than me

[BURR]
Okay

[HAMILTON]
I know I talk too much, I'm abrasive
You're incredible in court. You're succinct, persuasive
My client needs a strong defense. You're the solution

[BURR]
Who's your client?

[HAMILTON]
The new U.S. Constitution?

[BURR]
No

[HAMILTON]
Hear me out

[BURR]
No way!

[HAMILTON]
A series of essays, anonymously published
Defending the document to the public

[BURR]
No one will read it

[HAMILTON]
I disagree

[BURR]
And if it fails?

[HAMILTON]
Burr, that's why we need it

[BURR]
The constitution's a mess

[HAMILTON]
So it needs amendments

[BURR]
It's full of contradictions

[HAMILTON]
So is independence
We have to start somewhere

[BURR]
No. No way

[HAMILTON]
You're making a mistake

[BURR]
Good night

[HAMILTON]
Hey
What are you waiting for?
What do you stall for?

[BURR]
What?

[HAMILTON]
We won the war
What was it all for?
Do you support this constitution?

[BURR]
Of course

[HAMILTON]
Then defend it

[BURR]
And what if you're backing the wrong horse?

[HAMILTON]
Burr, we studied and we fought and we killed
For the notion of a nation we now get to build
For once in your life, take a stand with pride
I don't understand how you stand to the side

[BURR]
I'll keep all my plans
Close to my chest

I'll wait here and see
Which way the wind
Will blow
I'm taking my time
Watching the
Afterbirth of a nation
Watching the tension grow.

[ENSEMBLE]
Wait for it, wait for
It, wait...

Which way the wind
Will blow
I'm taking my time
Watching the
Afterbirth of a nation
Watching the tension grow.

[ANGELICA]
I am sailing off to London. I'm accompanied by someone
Who always pays
I have found a wealthy husband who will keep
Me in comfort for all my days
He is not a lot of fun, but there's no one who
Can match you for turn of phrase
My Alexander

[HAMILTON]
Angelica

[ANGELICA]
Don't forget to write

[ELIZA]
Look at where you are
Look at where you started
The fact that you're alive is a miracle
Just stay alive, that would be enough
And if your wife could share a fraction of your time
If I could grant you peace of mind
Would that be enough?

[BURR]
Alexander joins forces with James Madison and John Jay to write a series of essays defending the new United States Constitution, entitled The Federalist Papers. The plan was to write a total of twenty-five essays, the work divided evenly among the three men. In the end, they wrote eighty-five essays, in the span of six months. John Jay got sick after writing five. James Madison wrote twenty-nine. Hamilton wrote the other fifty-one!

[BURR]
How do you write like you're
Running out of time?
Write day and night like you're
Running out of time?

[BURR AND MEN]
Ev'ry day you fight
Like you're
Running out of time
Like you're
Running out of time
Are you
Running out of time?
[ALL WOMEN]
Running out of time?
Running out of time?
Running out of time
Running out of time
Awwww!

[FULL COMPANY (EXCEPT HAMILTON)]
How do you write like tomorrow won't arrive?
How do you write like you need it to survive?
How do you write ev'ry second you're alive?
Ev'ry second you're alive? Ev'ry second you're alive?

[WASHINGTON]
They are asking me to lead
I am doing the best I can
To get the people that I need
I'm asking you to be my right hand man

[HAMILTON]
Treasury or State?

[WASHINGTON]
I know it's a lot to ask

[HAMILTON]
Treasury or State?

[WASHINGTON]
To leave behind the world you know...

[HAMILTON]
Sir, do you want me to run the Treasury or State department?

[WASHINGTON]
Treasury

[HAMILTON]
Let's go

[ELIZA]
Alexander...

[HAMILTON]
I have to leave

[ELIZA]
Alexander-

[HAMILTON]
Look around, look around at how lucky we are to be alive right now

Helpless...

[ELIZA]
Look around, isn't this enough?

How does a bastard, orphan, son of a whore and a
Scotsman, dropped in the middle of a
Forgotten spot in the Caribbean by providence
Impoverished, in squalor
Grow up to be a hero and a scholar?

[LAURENS]
The ten-dollar founding father without a father
Got a lot farther by working a lot harder
By being a lot smarter
By being a self-starter
By fourteen, they placed him in charge of a
Trading charter

[JEFFERSON]
And every day while slaves were being slaughtered and carted
Away across the waves, he struggled and kept his guard up
Inside, he was longing for something to be a part of
The brother was ready to beg, steal, borrow, or barter

[MADISON]
Then a hurricane came, and devastation reigned
Our man saw his future drip, dripping down the drain
Put a pencil to his temple, connected it to his brain
And he wrote his first refrain, a testament to his pain

[BURR]
Well, the word got around, they said, "This kid is insane, man"
Took up a collection just to send him to the mainland
"Get your education, don't forget from whence you came, and
The world is gonna know your name. What's your name, man?"

[HAMILTON]
Alexander Hamilton
My name is Alexander Hamilton
And there's a million things I haven't done
But just you wait, just you wait...

[ELIZA]
When he was ten his father split, full of it, debt-ridden
Two years later, see Alex and his mother bed-ridden
Half-dead sittin in their own sick, the scent thick

[COMPANY]
And Alex got better but his mother went quick

[WASHINGTON]
Moved in with a cousin, the cousin committed suicide
Left him with nothin' but ruined pride, something new inside
A voice saying
[WASHINGTON]
"You gotta fend for yourself." [COMPANY]
"Alex, you gotta fend for yourself."

[WASHINGTON]
He started retreatin' and readin' every treatise on the shelf
[BURR]
There would have been nothin' left to do
For someone less astute
He woulda been dead or destitute
Without a cent of restitution
Started workin', clerkin' for his late mother's landlord
Tradin' sugar cane and rum and all the things he can't afford
Scammin' for every book he can get his hands on
Plannin' for the future see him now as he stands on
The bow of a ship headed for a new land
In New York you can be a new man

[COMPANY]
In New York you can
Be a new man-
In New York you can
Be a new man-

[COMPANY]
Scammin'

Plannin'
Oooh...

Just you wait!

In New York you can be a new man-

We are waiting in the wings for you

You could never back down
You never learned to take your time!

Oh, Alexander Hamilton

When America sings for you
Will they know what you overcame?
Will they know you rewrote the game?
The world will never be the same, oh

[BURR]
The ship is in the harbor now
See if you can spot him

Another immigrant
Comin' up from the bottom

His enemies destroyed his rep
America forgot him

Alexander Hamilton

Waiting in the wings for you

You never learned to take your time!

Oh, Alexander Hamilton

We fought with him

[LAURENS]
Me? I died for him

Me? I trusted him

Me? I loved him

There's a million things I haven't done
But just you wait!

Aaron Burr, Sir

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[COMPANY]
1776. New York City

[HAMILTON]
Pardon me. Are you Aaron Burr, sir?

[BURR]
That depends. Who's asking?

[HAMILTON]
Oh, well, sure, sir
I'm Alexander Hamilton, I'm at your service, sir
I have been looking for you

[BURR]
I'm getting nervous

[HAMILTON]
Sir...
I heard your name at Princeton. I was seeking an accelerated course of study when I got sort of out of sorts with a buddy of yours. I may have punched him. It's a blur, sir. He handles the financials?

[BURR]
You punched the bursar

[HAMILTON]
Yes!
I wanted to do what you did. Graduate in two, then join the revolution. He looked at me like I was stupid, I'm not stupid

So how'd you do it? How'd you graduate so fast?

[BURR]
It was my parents' dying wish before they passed

[HAMILTON]
You're an orphan. Of course! I'm an orphan
God, I wish there was a war!
Then we could prove that we're worth more
Than anyone bargained for...

[BURR]
Can I buy you a drink?

[HAMILTON]
That would be nice

[BURR]
While we're talking, let me offer you some free advice
Talk less

[HAMILTON]
What?

[BURR]
Smile more

[HAMILTON]
Ha

[BURR]
Don't let them know what you're against or what you're for

[HAMILTON]
You can't be serious

[BURR]
You wanna get ahead?

[HAMILTON]
Yes

[BURR]
Fools who run their mouths off wind up dead

[LAURENS]
Yo yo yo yo yo!
What time is it?

[LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
Show time!

[BURR]
...like I said...

[LAURENS]
Show time! Show time! Yo!
I'm John Laurens in the place to be!
Two pints o' Sam Adams, but I'm workin' on three, uh!
Those redcoats don't want it with me!
Cuz I will pop chick-a pop these cops till I'm free!

[LAFAYETTE]
Oui oui, mon ami, je m'appelle Lafayette!
The Lancelot of the revolutionary set!
I came from afar just to say "Bonsoir!"
Tell the King "Casse toi!" Who's the best?
C'est moi!

[MULLIGAN]
Brrrah brraaah! I am Hercules Mulligan
Up in it, lovin' it, yes I heard ya mother said "Come again?"
Lock up ya daughters and horses, of course
It's hard to have intercourse over four sets of corsets...

[LAURENS]
No more sex, pour me another brew, son!
Let's raise a couple more...

[LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
To the revolution!

[LAURENS]
Well, if it ain't the prodigy of Princeton college!

[MULLIGAN]
Aaron Burr!

[LAURENS]
Give us a verse, drop some knowledge!

[BURR]
Good luck with that: you're takin' a stand
You spit. I'm ‘a sit. We'll see where we land

[LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
Boooo!

[LAURENS]
Burr, the revolution's imminent. What do you stall for?

[HAMILTON]
If you stand for nothing, Burr, what'll you fall for?
[LAURENS]
Ooh
Who are you? [MULLIGAN]
Ooh

Who are you? [LAFAYETTE]
Ooh

Who are you?

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE/LAURENS]
Ooh, who is this kid? What's he gonna do?

My Shot

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[HAMILTON]
I am not throwing away my shot!
I am not throwing away my shot!
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot!
I'm ‘a get a scholarship to King's College
I prob'ly shouldn't brag, but dag, I amaze and astonish
The problem is I got a lot of brains but no polish
I gotta holler just to be heard
With every word, I drop knowledge!
I'm a diamond in the rough, a shiny piece of coal
Tryin' to reach my goal. My power of speech: unimpeachable
Only nineteen but my mind is older
These New York City streets get colder, I shoulder
Ev'ry burden, ev'ry disadvantage
I have learned to manage, I don't have a gun to brandish
I walk these streets famished
The plan is to fan this spark into a flame
But damn, it's getting dark, so let me spell out the name
I am the-

[HAMILTON/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN/LAURENS]
A-L-E-X-A-N-D
E-R-we are-meant to be...

[HAMILTON]
A colony that runs independently
Meanwhile, Britain keeps shittin' on us endlessly
Essentially, they tax us relentlessly
Then King George turns around, runs a spending spree
He ain't ever gonna set his descendants free
So there will be a revolution in this century
Enter me!

[LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN/LAURENS]
(He says in parentheses)

[HAMILTON]
Don't be shocked when your hist'ry book mentions me
I will lay down my life if it sets us free
Eventually, you'll see my ascendancy
[HAMILTON]
And I am not throwing away
My shot
I am not throwing away
My shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot
[LAURENS]
My shot!

My shot!

And I'm not throwing away my shot.

[HAMILTON/MULLIGAN/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE]
I am not throwing away my shot
I am not throwing away my shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot
It's time to take a shot!

[LAFAYETTE]
I dream of life without a monarchy
The unrest in France will lead to ‘onarchy?
‘Onarchy? How you say, how you say, ‘anarchy?'
When I fight, I make the other side panicky
With my-

[HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
Shot!

[MULLIGAN]
Yo, I'm a tailor's apprentice
And I got y'all knuckleheads in loco parentis
I'm joining the rebellion cuz I know it's my chance
To socially advance, instead of sewin' some pants!
I'm gonna take a-

[HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
Shot!

[LAURENS]
But we'll never be truly free
Until those in bondage have the same rights as you and me
You and I. Do or die. Wait till I sally in
On a stallion with the first black battalion
Have another-

[HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
Shot!

[BURR]
Geniuses, lower your voices
You keep out of trouble and you double your choices
I'm with you, but the situation is fraught
You've got to be carefully taught:
If you talk, you're gonna get shot!

[HAMILTON]
Burr, check what we got
Mister Lafayette, hard rock like Lancelot
I think your pants look hot
Laurens, I like you a lot
Let's hatch a plot blacker than the kettle callin' the pot...
What are the odds the gods would put us all in one spot
Poppin' a squat on conventional wisdom, like it or not
A bunch of revolutionary manumission abolitionists?
Give me a position, show me where the ammunition is!

Oh, am I talkin' too loud?
Sometimes I get over excited, shoot off at the mouth
I never had a group of friends before
I promise that I'll make y'all proud

[LAURENS]
Let's get this guy in front of a crowd

[HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN/ENSEMBLE]
I am not throwing away my shot
I am not throwing away my shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry

I am not throwing away my shot

Hey yo, I'm just like my country

Ev'rybody sing:
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Hey!
Whoa!
Wooh!!

Ay, let ‘em hear ya!

Let's go!

[HAMILTON]
I imagine death so much it feels more like a memory
When's it gonna get me?
In my sleep? Seven feet ahead of me?
If I see it comin', do I run or do I let it be?
Is it like a beat without a melody?
See, I never thought I'd live past twenty
Where I come from some get half as many
Ask anybody why we livin' fast and we laugh, reach for a flask
We have to make this moment last, that's plenty

Scratch that
This is not a moment, it's the movement
Where all the hungriest brothers with
Something to prove went?
Foes oppose us, we take an honest stand
We roll like Moses, claimin' our promised land
And? If we win our independence?
‘Zat a guarantee of freedom for our descendants?
Or will the blood we shed begin an endless
Cycle of vengeance and death with no defendants?
I know the action in the street is excitin'
But Jesus, between all the bleedin' ‘n fightin'
I've been readin' ‘n writin'
We need to handle our financial situation
Are we a nation of states? What's the state of our nation?
I'm past patiently waitin'. I'm passionately
Smashin' every expectation
Every action's an act of creation!
I'm laughin' in the face of casualties and sorrow
For the first time, I'm thinkin' past tomorrow

Schuyler Sisters

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[BURR]
There's nothing rich folks love more
Than going downtown and slummin' it with the poor
They pull up in their carriages and gawk
At the students in the common
Just to watch them talk
Take Philip Schuyler: the man is loaded
Uh-oh, but little does he know that
His daughters, Peggy, Angelica, Eliza
Sneak into the city just to watch all the guys at-

Someone in a rush next to someone lookin' pretty
Excuse me, miss, I know it's not funny
But your perfume smells like your daddy's got money
Why you slummin' in the city in your fancy heels
You searchin for an urchin who can give you ideals?

[ANGELICA]
Burr, you disgust me

[BURR]
Ah, so you've discussed me
I'm a trust fund, baby, you can trust me!

[ANGELICA]
I've been reading Common Sense by Thomas Paine
So men say that I'm intense or I'm insane
You want a revolution? I want a revelation

Farmer Refuted

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[SEABURY]
Hear ye, hear ye! My name is Samuel Seabury
And I present "Free Thoughts on the
Proceedings of the Continental Congress!"
Heed not the rabble who scream revolution
They have not your interests at heart

[MULLIGAN]
Oh my God. Tear this dude apart

[SEABURY]
Chaos and bloodshed are not a solution
Don't let them lead you astray
This Congress does not speak for me

[BURR]
Let him be

[SEABURY]
They're playing a dangerous game
I pray the king shows you his mercy
For shame, for shame...
[HAMILTON]
Yo!
He'd have you all unravel at the
Sound of screams but the
Revolution is comin'
The have-nots are gonna
Win this
It's hard to listen to you with a straight face

Chaos and bloodshed already haunt us, honestly you shouldn't even talk. And what about Boston? Look at the cost, n' all that we've lost n' you talk
About Congress?!

My dog speaks more eloquently than thee!

But strangely, your mange is the same

Is he in Jersey?

For the revolution!
[SEABURY]
Heed not the rabble
Who scream
Revolution, they
Have not your
Interests
At heart

Chaos and bloodshed are
Not a
Solution. Don't
Let them lead you
Astray
This Congress does not
Speak for me

They're playing a dangerous game

I pray the king shows you his mercy

For shame

For shame,

[COMPANY]
For the revolution!

[SEABURY]
Heed-

[HAMILTON]
If you repeat yourself again I'm gonna-

[SEABURY/HAMILTON]
Scream-

[HAMILTON]
Honestly, look at me, please don't read!

[SEABURY]
Not your interests-

[HAMILTON]
Don't modulate the key then not debate with me!
Why should a tiny island across the sea regulate the price of tea?

[BURR]
Alexander, please!

[HAMILTON]
Burr, I'd rather be divisive than indecisive, drop the niceties

[ENSEMBLE]
Silence! A message from the King!
A message from the King!

You'll Be Back

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[KING GEORGE]
You say
The price of my love's not a price that you're willing to pay
You cry
In your tea which you hurl in the sea when you see me go by
Why so sad?
Remember we made an arrangement when you went away
Now you're making me mad
Remember, despite our estrangement, I'm your man
You'll be back
Soon you'll see
You'll remember you belong to me
You'll be back
Time will tell
You'll remember that I served you well
Oceans rise
Empires fall
We have seen each other through it all
And when push
Comes to shove
I will send a fully armed battalion
To remind you of my love!

Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da
Da da dat dat da ya da!
Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da
Da da dat dat da...

You say our love is draining and you can't go on
You'll be the one complaining when I am gone...
And no, don't change the subject
Cuz you're my favorite subject
My sweet, submissive subject
My loyal, royal subject
Forever and ever and ever and ever and ever...

You'll be back
Like before
I will fight the fight and win the war
For your love
For your praise
And I'll love you till my dying days
When you're gone
I'll go mad
So don't throw away this thing we had

Cuz when push comes to shove
I will kill your friends and family to remind you of my love
Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da
Da da dat dat da ya da!
Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da
Da da dat-
Everybody!

[ENSEMBLE]
Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da
Da da dat dat da ya da!
Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da da da da

As a kid in the Caribbean I wished for a war
I knew that I was poor
I knew it was the only way to-

[HAMILTON/BURR/MULLIGAN/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE]
Rise up!

[HAMILTON]
If they tell my story
I am either gonna die on the battlefield in glory or-

[HAMILTON/BURR/MULLIGAN/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE]
Rise up!

[HAMILTON]
We will fight for this land
But there's only one man
Who can give us a command so we can-

[HAMILTON/BURR/MULLIGAN/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE]
Rise up!

Understand? It's the only way to-

We gotta make an all out stand
Ayo, I'm gonna need a right-hand man.
ENSEMBLE
What?

What?

Buck, buck, buck, buck, buck!

Buck, buck, buck, buck, buck!

[WASHINGTON]
Check it-
Can I be real a second?
For just a millisecond?
Let down my guard and tell the people how I feel a second?
Now I'm the model of a modern major general
The venerated Virginian veteran whose men are all
Lining up, to put me up on a pedestal
Writin' letters to relatives
Embellishin' my elegance and eloquence
But the elephant is in the room
The truth is in ya face when ya hear the British cannons go...

[ENSEMBLE]
Boom!

[WASHINGTON]
Any hope of success is fleeting
How can I keep leading when the people I'm
Leading keep retreating?
We put a stop to the bleeding as the British take Brooklyn
Knight takes rook, but look
[WASHINGTON]
We are outgunned

Outmanned

Outnumbered
Outplanned

We gotta make an all out stand
Ayo, I'm gonna need a right-hand man

Incoming!
[ENSEMBLE]

Buck, buck, buck, buck, buck!

[MULLIGAN]

[HAMILTON]
We gotta stop ‘em and rob ‘em of their advantages

[MULLIGAN]
Rah!

[HAMILTON]
Let's take a stand with the stamina God has granted us
Hamilton won't abandon ship
Yo, let's steal their cannons-
[MULLIGAN]
Shh-boom! [COMPANY]
Boom!

[WASHINGTON]
Goes the cannon, watch the blood and the shit spray and...

[COMPANY]
Boom!

[WASHINGTON]
Goes the cannon, we're abandonin' Kips Bay and...

[COMPANY]
Boom!

[WASHINGTON]
There's another ship and...

[COMPANY]
Boom!

[WASHINGTON]
We just lost the southern tip and...

[COMPANY]
Boom!

[WASHINGTON]
We gotta run to Harlem quick, we can't afford another slip
Guns and horses giddyup
I decide to divvy up
My forces, they're skittish as the British cut the city up
This close to giving up, facing mad scrutiny
I scream in the face of this mass mutiny:
Are these the men with which I am to defend America?
We ride at midnight, Manhattan in the distance
I cannot be everywhere at once, people
I'm in dire need of assistance...

[BURR]
Your excellency, sir!

[WASHINGTON]
Who are you?

[BURR]
Aaron Burr, Sir?
Permission to state my case?

[WASHINGTON]
As you were

[BURR]
Sir
I was a captain under General Montgomery
Until he caught a bullet in the neck in Quebec
And well, in summary
I think that I could be of some assistance
I admire how you keep firing on the British
From a distance

[WASHINGTON]
Huh

[BURR]
I have some questions, a couple of suggestions on how to fight instead of fleeing west

[WASHINGTON]
Yes?

[BURR]
Well-

[HAMILTON]
Your excellency, you wanted to see me?

[WASHINGTON]
Hamilton, come in, have you met Burr?

[HAMILTON]
Yes, sir

[HAMILTON AND BURR]
We keep meeting

[BURR]
As I was saying, sir, I look forward to seeing your strategy play out

[WASHINGTON]
Burr?

[BURR]
Sir?

[WASHINGTON]
Close the door on your way out

[HAMILTON]
Have I done something wrong, sir?

[WASHINGTON]
On the contrary
I called you here because our odds are beyond scary
Your reputation precedes you, but I have to laugh

[HAMILTON]
Sir?

[WASHINGTON]
Hamilton, how come no one can get you on their staff?

[HAMILTON]
Sir!

[WASHINGTON]
Don't get me wrong, you're a young man, of great renown
I know you stole British cannons when we were still downtown
Nathaniel Green and Henry Knox wanted to hire you...

[HAMILTON]
To be their Secretary? I don't think so

[WASHINGTON]
Why're you upset?

[HAMILTON]
I'm not-

[WASHINGTON]
It's alright, you want to fight, you've got a hunger
I was just like you when I was younger
Head full of fantasies of dyin' like a martyr?

[HAMILTON]
Yes

[WASHINGTON]
Dying is easy, young man. Living is harder

[HAMILTON]
Why are you telling me this?

[WASHINGTON]
I'm being honest
I'm working with a third of what our Congress has promised
We are a powder keg about to explode
I need someone like you to lighten the load. So?

[COMPANY (EXCEPT HAMILTON)]
I am not throwin' away my shot!
I am not throwin' away my shot!
Ayo, I'm just like my country, I'm young
Scrappy and hungry!

[HAMILTON]
I am not throwing away my shot!

[WASHINGTON]
Son

[WASHINGON AND COMPANY]
We are outgunned, outmanned!

[HAMILTON]
You need all the help you can get
I have some friends. Laurens, Mulligan
Marquis de Lafayette, okay, what else?

[WASHINGTON AND COMPANY]
Outnumbered, outplanned!

[HAMILTON]
We'll need some spies on the inside
Some King's men who might let some things slide
[HAMILTON]
I'll write to Congress and tell ‘em we need supplies, you rally the guys, master the element of surprise

I'll rise above my station, organize your information, ‘til we rise to the occasion of our new nation. Sir!

[ENSEMBLE]
Here comes the General!

A Winter's Ball

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[BURR]
How does the bastard, orphan, son of a whore
Go on and on
Grow into more of a phenomenon?
Watch this obnoxious, arrogant, loudmouth bother
Be seated at the right hand of the father
Washington hires Hamilton right on sight
But Hamilton still wants to fight, not write
Now Hamilton's skill with a quill is undeniable
But what do we have in common? We're
Reliable with the

[ALL MEN]
Ladies!

[BURR]
There are so many to deflower!

[ALL MEN]
Ladies!

They delighted and distracted him
Martha Washington named her feral tomcat after him!

That's true

A winter's ball
And the Schuyler sisters are the envy of all
Yo, if you can marry a sister, you're rich, son

[ELIZA AND WOMEN]
Helpless!
Look into your eyes, and the sky's the limit I'm helpless!
Down for the count, and I'm drownin' in ‘em

[ELIZA]
I have never been the type to try and grab the spotlight
We were at a revel with some rebels on a hot night
Laughin' at my sister as she's dazzling the room
Then you walked in and my heart went "Boom!"
Tryin' to catch your eye from the side of the ballroom
Everybody's dancin' and the band's top volume

[ELIZA AND WOMEN]
Grind to the rhythm as we wine and dine
[ELIZA]
Grab my sister, and
Whisper, "Yo, this
One's mine."

My sister made her way across the room to you
And I got nervous, thinking "What's she gonna do?"
She grabbed you by the arm, I'm thinkin' "I'm through"
Then you look back at me and suddenly I'm
Helpless!

Oh, look at those eyes

Oh!
Yeah, I'm
Helpless, I know

I'm so into you
I am so into you

I know I'm down for the count
And I'm drownin' in ‘em.

[ELIZA]
Elizabeth Schuyler. It's a pleasure to meet you

[HAMILTON]
Schuyler?

[ANGELICA]
My sister

[ELIZA]
Thank you for all your service

[HAMILTON]
If it takes fighting a war for us to meet, it will have been worth it

[ANGELICA]
I'll leave you to it

[ELIZA AND WOMEN]
One week later

[ELIZA]
I'm writin' a letter nightly
Now my life gets better, every letter that you write me
Laughin' at my sister, cuz she wants to form a harem

[ANGELICA]
I'm just sayin', if you really loved me, you would share him
[ELIZA]
Ha!
Two weeks later
In the living room stressin'
My father's stone-faced
While you're asking for his blessin'
I'm dying inside, as
You wine
And dine
And I'm tryin' not to cry
‘cause there's nothing that your mind can't do
My father makes his way across the room
To you
I panic for a second, thinking
"we're through"
But then he shakes your hand and says
"Be true"
And you turn back to me, smiling, and I'm
Helpless!

Helpless!
Hoo!

That boy is mine
That boy is mine!

Helpless! Helpless!
Down for the count

Look into your eyes
And the sky's the
Limit I'm
Helpless!
Down for the count
And I'm drownin' in em

[HAMILTON]
Eliza, I don't have a dollar to my name
An acre of land, a troop to command, a dollop of fame
All I have's my honor, a tolerance for pain
A couple of college credits and my top-notch brain
Insane, your family brings out a different side of me
Peggy confides in me, Angelica tried to take a bite of me
No stress, my love for you is never in doubt
We'll get a little place in Harlem and we'll figure it out
I've been livin' without a family since I was a child
My father left, my mother died, I grew up buckwild
But I'll never forget my mother's face, that was real
And long as I'm alive, Eliza, swear to God
You'll never feel so...

[HAMILTON]
Eliza...

I've never felt so-

My life is gon' be fine cuz Eliza's in it.
[ELIZA]
I do I do I do I do!

I do I do I do I do!

Hey, yeah, yeah!

I'm down for the count
I'm-

I look into your eyes, and the sky's the limit
I'm

Satisfied

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[LAURENS]
Alright, alright. That's what I'm talkin' about!
Now everyone give it up for the maid of honor
Angelica Schuyler!
[ANGELICA]
A toast to the groom!

To the bride!

From your sister

Who is always by your side

To your union

And the hope that you provide

May you always...

Be satisfied.

[ALL MEN]
To the groom!

[ALL WOMEN]
To the groom!

To the bride!

To the bride!

[ELIZA AND WOMEN]
Angelica!

By your side!

To the union!
To the revolution!

You provide!

Always-

Rewind-

[ANGELICA]
I remember that night, I just might
Regret that night for the rest of my days

I remember those soldier boys
Tripping over themselves to win our praise

I remember that dreamlike candlelight
Like a dream that you can't quite place

But Alexander, I'll never forget the first
Time I saw your face

I have never been the same
Intelligent eyes in a hunger-pang frame
And when you said "Hi," I forgot my dang name
Set my heart aflame, ev'ry part aflame

[FULL COMPANY]
This is not a game...

[HAMILTON]
You strike me as a woman who has never been satisfied

[ANGELICA]
I'm sure I don't know what you mean. You forget yourself

[HAMILTON]
You're like me. I'm never satisfied

[ANGELICA]
Is that right?

[HAMILTON]
I have never been satisfied

[ANGELICA]
My name is Angelica Schuyler

[HAMILTON]
Alexander Hamilton

[ANGELICA]
Where's your fam'ly from?

[HAMILTON]
Unimportant. There's a million things I haven't done but
Just you wait, just you wait...

[ANGELICA]
So so so-
So this is what it feels like to match wits
With someone at your level! What the hell is the catch? It's
The feeling of freedom, of seein' the light
It's Ben Franklin with a key and a kite! You see it, right?
The conversation lasted two minutes, maybe three minutes
Ev'rything we said in total agreement, it's
A dream and it's a bit of a dance
A bit of a posture, it's a bit of a stance. He's a
Bit of a flirt, but I'm ‘a give it a chance
I asked about his fam'ly, did you see his answer?
His hands started fidgeting, he looked askance?
He's penniless, he's flying by the seat of his pants

Handsome, boy, does he know it!
Peach fuzz, and he can't even grow it!
I wanna take him far away from this place
Then I turn and see my sister's face and she is...

[ELIZA]
Helpless...

[ANGELICA]
And I know she is...

[ELIZA]
Helpless...

[ANGELICA]
And her eyes are just...

[ELIZA]
Helpless...

[ANGELICA]
And I realize

[ANGELICA AND COMPANY]
Three fundamental truths at the exact same time...

[HAMILTON]
Where are you taking me?

[ANGELICA]
I'm about to change your life

[HAMILTON]
Then by all means, lead the way

[COMPANY (EXCEPT ANGELICA)]
Number one!

[ANGELICA]
I'm a girl in a world in which
My only job is to marry rich
My father has no sons so I'm the one
Who has to social climb for one
So I'm the oldest and the wittiest and the gossip in
New York City is insidious
Alexander is penniless
Ha! That doesn't mean I want him any less

[ELIZA]
Elizabeth Schuyler. It's a pleasure to meet you

[HAMILTON]
Schuyler?

[ANGELICA]
My sister

[COMPANY]
Number two!

[ANGELICA]
He's after me cuz I'm a Schuyler sister
That elevates his status, I'd
Have to be naïve to set that aside
Maybe that is why I introduce him to Eliza
Now that's his bride
Nice going, Angelica, he was right
You will never be satisfied

[ELIZA]
Thank you for all your service

[HAMILTON]
If it takes fighting a war for us to meet, it will have been worth it

[ANGELICA]
I'll leave you to it

[COMPANY]
Number three!

[ANGELICA]
I know my sister like I know my own mind
You will never find anyone as trusting or as kind
If I tell her that I love him she'd be silently resigned
He'd be mine
She would say, "I'm fine"

[ANGELICA AND COMPANY]
She'd be lying

[ANGELICA]
But when I fantasize at night
It's Alexander's eyes
As I romanticize what might
Have been if I hadn't sized him
Up so quickly
At least my dear Eliza's his wife;
At least I keep his eyes in my life...
[ANGELICA]
To the groom!

To the bride!

From your sister

Who is always by your side

To your union

And the hope that you provide

May you always

Be satisfied

And I know

She'll be happy as

His bride
And I know [ALL MEN (EXCEPT HAMILTON)]
To the groom!

The Story of Tonight (Reprise)

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[LAURENS]
I may not live to see our glory!

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE]
I may not live to see our glory!

[LAURENS]
But I've seen wonders great and small

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE]
I've seen wonders great and small

[LAURENS]
‘Cause if the tomcat can get married

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE]
If Alexander can get married-

[LAURENS]
There's hope for our ass, after all!

[LAFAYETTE]
Raise a glass to freedom

[LAURENS/MULLIGAN]
Hey!
Something you will never see again!

[MULLIGAN]
No matter what she tells you

[LAFAYETTE]
Let's have another round tonight!

[LAURENS]
Raise a glass to the four of us!

[LAFAYETTE/HAMILTON]
Ho!

[MULLIGAN]
To the newly not poor of us!

[LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/HAMILTON]
Woo!

[LAFAYETTE]
We'll tell the story of tonight

[LAURENS]
Let's have another round-

[HAMILTON]
Well, if it isn't Aaron Burr

[BURR]
Sir!

[HAMILTON]
I didn't think that you would make it

[BURR]
To be sure

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE]
Burr!

[BURR]
I came to say congratulations

[MULLIGAN]
Spit a verse, Burr!

[BURR]
I see the whole gang is here

[LAFAYETTE]
You are the worst, Burr!

[HAMILTON]
Ignore them. Congrats to you, Lieutenant Colonel
I wish I had your command instead of manning George's journal

[BURR]
No, you don't

[HAMILTON]
Yes, I do

[BURR]
Now, be sensible
From what I hear, you've made yourself indispensable

[LAURENS]
Well, well, I heard
You've got a special someone on the side, Burr

[HAMILTON]
Is that so?

[LAURENS]
What are you tryin' to hide, Burr?

[BURR]
I should go

[HAMILTON]
No, these guys should go

[LAFAYETTE]
What?

[LAURENS]
No!

[HAMILTON]
Leave us alone

[MULLIGAN]
Man...

[HAMILTON]
It's alright, Burr. I wish you'd brought this girl with you tonight, Burr

[BURR]
You're very kind, but I'm afraid it's unlawful, sir

[HAMILTON]
What do you mean?

[BURR]
She's married

[HAMILTON]
I see

[BURR]
She's married to a British officer

[HAMILTON]
Oh shit...

[BURR]
Congrats again, Alexander. Smile more
I'll see you on the other side of the war

[HAMILTON]
I will never understand you
If you love this woman, go get her! What are you waiting for?

[BURR]
I'll see you on the other side of the war

[HAMILTON]
I'll see you on the other side of the war

Wait For It

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[BURR]
Theodosia writes me a letter everyday
I'm keeping the bed warm while her husband is away
He's on the British side in Georgia
He's trying to keep the colonies in line
But he can keep all of Georgia
Theodosia, she's mine

Love doesn't discriminate
Between the sinners
And the saints
It takes and it takes and it takes
And we keep loving anyway
We laugh and we cry
And we break
And we make our mistakes
And if there's a reason I'm by her side
When so many have tried
Then I'm willing to wait for it
I'm willing to wait for it
[BURR]
My grandfather was a fire and brimstone preacher

But there are things that the
Homilies and hymns won't teach ya

My mother was a genius

My father commanded respect

When they died they left no instructions
Just a legacy to protect

[MEN]
Preacher, preacher
Preacher

Teach ya, teach ya, teach ya

Respect, respect

[WOMEN]
Genius

[BURR/ENSEMBLE]
Death doesn't discriminate
Between the sinners
And the saints
It takes and it takes and it takes
And we keep living anyway
We rise and we fall
And we break
And we make our mistakes
And if there's a reason I'm still alive
When everyone who loves me has died
I'm willing to wait for it
I'm willing to wait for it

Wait for it

[ENSEMBLE]
Wait for it
Wait for it
Wait for it

[BURR]
I am the one thing in life I can control

[ENSEMBLE]
Wait for it

I am inimitable
I am an original

[ENSEMBLE]
Wait for it

[BURR]
I'm not falling behind or running late

[ENSEMBLE]
Wait for it
Wait for it

[BURR]
I'm not standing still
I am lying in wait

[ENSEMBLE]
Wait

[BURR]
Hamilton faces an endless uphill climb

[ENSEMBLE]
Climb
Climb
Climb

[BURR]
He has something to prove
He has nothing to lose

[ENSEMBLE]
Lose
Lose
Lose
Lose

[BURR]
Hamilton's pace is relentless
He wastes no time

[ENSEMBLE]
Time
Time
Time

[BURR]
What is it like in his shoes?

Hamilton doesn't hesitate
He exhibits no restraint
He takes and he takes and he takes
And he keeps winning anyway
He changes the game
He plays and he raises the stakes
And if there's a reason
He seems to thrive when so few survive, then Goddamnit-
[BURR]
I'm willing to wait for it

I'm willing to wait for it...

Life doesn't discriminate
Between the sinners and the saints
It takes and it takes and it takes

We rise
We fall

And if there's a reason I'm still alive
When so many have died
Then I'm willin' to-
[COMPANY]
I'm willing to wait for it
Wait for it

Between the sinners and the saints
It takes and it takes and it takes
And we keep living anyway
We rise and we fall and we break

And if there's a reason I'm still alive
When so many have died
Then I'm willin' to-

Stay Alive

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[ELIZA]
Stay alive...

[ELIZA/ANGELICA/ENSEMBLE WOMEN]
Stay alive...

[HAMILTON]
I have never seen the General so despondent
I have taken over writing all his correspondence
Congress writes, "George, attack the British forces."
I shoot back, we have resorted to eating our horses
Local merchants deny us equipment, assistance
They only take British money, so sing a song of sixpence

[WASHINGTON]
The cavalry's not coming

[HAMILTON]
Sir!

[WASHINGTON]
Alex, listen. There's only one way for us to win this
Provoke outrage, outright

[HAMILTON]
That's right

[WASHINGTON]
Don't engage, strike by night
Remain relentless ‘til their troops take flight

[HAMILTON]
Make it impossible to justify the cost of the fight

[WASHINGTON]
Outrun

[HAMILTON]
Outrun

[WASHINGTON]
Outlast

[HAMILTON]
Outlast

[WASHINGTON]
Hit ‘em quick, get out fast

[HAMILTON]
Chick-a-plao!

[WASHINGTON]
Stay alive ‘til this horror show is past
We're gonna fly a lot of flags half-mast

[HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE]
Raise a glass!

[MULLIGAN]
I go back to New York and my apprenticeship

[LAFAYETTE]
I ask for French aid, I pray that France has sent a ship

[LAURENS]
I stay at work with Hamilton
We write essays against slavery
And every day's a test of our camaraderie
And bravery

[HAMILTON]
We cut supply lines, we steal contraband
We pick and choose our battles and places to take a stand
And ev'ry day
"Sir, entrust me with a command,"
And ev'ry day

[WASHINGTON]
No

[HAMILTON]
He dismisses me out of hand
[HAMILTON]
Instead of me
He promotes
Charles Lee
Makes him second-in-command:

[LEE]
Charles Lee. [ELIZA/ANGELICA]
Stay alive...

[LEE]
I'm a General. Whee!!!!

[HAMILTON]
Yeah. He's not the choice I would have gone with

[HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE]
He shits the bed at the Battle of Monmouth

[WASHINGTON]
Ev'ryone attack!

[LEE]
Retreat!

[WASHINGTON]
Attack!

[LEE]
Retreat!

[WASHINGTON]
What are you doing, Lee? Get back on your feet!

[LEE]
But there's so many of them!

[WASHINGTON]
I'm sorry, is this not your speed?!
Hamilton!

[HAMILTON]
Ready, sir!

[WASHINGTON]
Have Lafayette take the lead!

[HAMILTON]
Yes, sir!

[LAURENS]
A thousand soldiers die in a hundred degree heat

[LAFAYETTE]
As we snatch a stalemate from the jaws of defeat

[HAMILTON]
Charles Lee was left behind
Without a pot to piss in
He started sayin' this to anybody who would listen:

[LEE]
Washington cannot be left alone to his devices
Indecisive, from crisis to crisis
The best thing he can do for the revolution
Is turn n' go back to plantin' tobacco in Mount Vernon

[COMPANY]
Oo!!

[WASHINGTON]
Don't do a thing. History will prove him wrong

[HAMILTON]
But, sir!

[WASHINGTON]
We have a war to fight, let's move along

[LAURENS]
Strong words from Lee, someone oughta hold him to it

[HAMILTON]
I can't disobey direct orders

[LAURENS]
Then I'll do it
Alexander, you're the closest friend I've got

[HAMILTON]
Laurens, do not throw away your shot

Ten Duel Commandments

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[MEN]
One, two, three, four

[FULL COMPANY]
Five, six, seven, eight, nine...

[BURR/HAMILTON/LAURENS/LEE]
It's the Ten Duel Commandments

[FULL COMPANY]
It's the Ten Duel Commandments
Number one!

[LAURENS]
The challenge: demand satisfaction
If they apologize, no need for further action

[COMPANY]
Number two!

[LAURENS]
If they don't, grab a friend, that's your second

[HAMILTON]
Your lieutenant when there's reckoning to be reckoned

[COMPANY]
Number three!

[LEE]
Have your seconds meet face to face

[BURR]
Negotiate a peace...

[HAMILTON]
Or negotiate a time and place

[BURR]
This is commonplace, ‘specially ‘tween recruits

[COMPANY]
Most disputes die, and no one shoots
Number four!

[LAURENS]
If they don't reach a peace, that's alright
Time to get some pistols and a doctor on site

[HAMILTON]
You pay him in advance, you treat him with civility

[BURR]
You have him turn around so he can have deniability

[COMPANY]
Five!

[LEE]
Duel before the sun is in the sky

[COMPANY]
Pick a place to die where it's high and dry
Number six!

[HAMILTON]
Leave a note for your next of kin
Tell ‘em where you been. Pray that hell or heaven lets you in

[COMPANY]
Seven!

[LEE]
Confess your sins. Ready for the moment of adrenaline when you finally face your opponent

[COMPANY]
Number eight!

[LAURENS/LEE/HAMILTON/BURR]
Your last chance to negotiate
Send in your seconds, see if they can set the record straight...

[BURR]
Alexander

[HAMILTON]
Aaron Burr, sir

[BURR]
Can we agree that duels are dumb and immature?

[HAMILTON]
Sure
But your man has to answer for his words, Burr

[BURR]
With his life? We both know that's absurd, sir

[HAMILTON]
Hang on, how many men died because Lee was inexperienced and ruinous?

[BURR]
Okay, so we're doin' this

[COMPANY]
Number nine!

[HAMILTON]
Look ‘em in the eye, aim no higher
Summon all the courage you require
Then count

[MEN]
One two three four

[FULL COMPANY]
Five six seven eight nine

[HAMILTON/BURR]
Number

[COMPANY]
Ten paces!

[HAMILTON/BURR]
Fire!

Meet Me Inside

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[HAMILTON]
Lee, do you yield?

[BURR]
You shot him in the side!
Yes, he yields!

[LAURENS]
I'm satisfied

[BURR]
Yo, we gotta clear the field!

[HAMILTON]
Go! We won

[COMPANY]
Here comes the General!

[BURR]
This should be fun

[WASHINGTON]
What is the meaning of this? Mr. Burr, get a medic for the General

[BURR]
Yes, sir

[WASHINGTON]
Lee, you will never agree with me
But believe me, these young men don't speak for me
Thank you for your service

[BURR]
Let's ride!

[WASHINGTON]
Hamilton!

[HAMILTON]
Sir!

[WASHINGTON]
Meet me inside

[COMPANY]
Meet him inside! Meet him inside!
Meet him inside, meet him, meet him inside!

[WASHINGTON]
Son-

[HAMILTON]
Don't call me son

[WASHINGTON]
This war is hard enough
Without infighting-

[HAMILTON]
Lee called you out. We called his bluff

[WASHINGTON]
You solve nothing, you aggravate our allies to the south

[HAMILTON]
You're absolutely right, John should have shot him in the mouth
That would've shut him up

[WASHINGTON]
Son-

[HAMILTON]
I'm notcha son-

[WASHINGTON]
Watch your tone
I am not a maiden in need of defending, I am grown

[HAMILTON (OVERLAPPING)]
Charles Lee, Thomas Conway
These men take your name and they rake it
Through the mud

[WASHINGTON]
My name's been through a lot, I can take it

[HAMILTON]
Well, I don't have your name. I don't have your titles
I don't have your land
But, if you-

[WASHINGTON]
No-

[HAMILTON]
If you gave me command of a battalion, a group of men to lead, I could fly above my station after the war

[WASHINGTON]
Or you could die and we need you alive

[HAMILTON]
I'm more than willing to die-

[WASHINGTON]
Your wife needs you alive, son, I need you alive-

[HAMILTON]
Call me son one more time-

[WASHINGTON]
Go home, Alexander
That's an order from your commander

[HAMILTON]
Sir-

[WASHINGTON]
Go home

That Would Be Enough

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[ELIZA]
Look around, look around at how lucky we are
To be alive right now
Look around, look around...

[HAMILTON]
How long have you known?

[ELIZA]
A month or so

[HAMILTON]
Eliza, you should have told me

[ELIZA]
I wrote to the General a month ago

[HAMILTON]
No

[ELIZA]
I begged him to send you home

[HAMILTON]
You should have told me

[ELIZA]
I'm not sorry
[ELIZA]
I knew you'd fight
Until the war was won

But you deserve a chance to meet your son
Look around, look around at how lucky we are
To be alive right now.
[HAMILTON]
The war's not
Done.

[HAMILTON]
Will you relish being a poor man's wife
Unable to provide for your life?

[ELIZA]
I relish being your wife
Look around, look around...

Look at where you are
Look at where you started
The fact that you're alive is a miracle
Just stay alive, that would be enough

And if this child
Shares a fraction of your smile
Or a fragment of your mind, look out world!
That would be enough

I don't pretend to know
The challenges you're facing
The worlds you keep erasing and creating in your mind

But I'm not afraid
I know who I married
So long as you come home at the end of the day
That would be enough

We don't need a legacy
We don't need money
If I could grant you peace of mind

If you could let me inside your heart...
Oh, let me be a part of the narrative
In the story they will write someday
Let this moment be the first chapter:
Where you decide to stay
And I could be enough
And we could be enough
That would be enough

Guns and Ships

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[BURR]
How does a ragtag volunteer army in need of a shower
Somehow defeat a global superpower?
How do we emerge victorious from the quagmire?
Leave the battlefield waving Betsy Ross' flag higher?
Yo. Turns out we have a secret weapon!
An immigrant you know and love who's unafraid to step in!
He's constantly confusin', confoundin' the British henchmen
Ev'ryone give it up for America's favorite fighting Frenchman!

[COMPANY]
Lafayette!

[LAFAYETTE]
I'm takin this horse by the reins makin'
Redcoats redder with bloodstains

[COMPANY]
Lafayette!

[LAFAYETTE]
And I'm never gonna stop until I make ‘em
Drop and burn ‘em up and scatter their remains, I'm

[COMPANY]
Lafayette!

[LAFAYETTE]
Watch me engagin' em! Escapin' em!
Enragin' em! I'm-

[COMPANY]
Lafayette!

[LAFAYETTE]
I go to France for more funds

[COMPANY]
Lafayette!

[LAFAYETTE]
I come back with more

[LAFAYETTE AND ENSEMBLE]
Guns
And ships
And so the balance shifts

[WASHINGTON]
We rendezvous with Rochambeau, consolidate their gifts

[LAFAYETTE]
We can end this war at Yorktown, cut them off at sea, but
For this to succeed, there's someone else we need:

[WASHINGTON]
I know

[WASHINGTON AND COMPANY]
Hamilton!

[LAFAYETTE]
Sir, he knows what to do in a trench
Ingenuitive and fluent in French, ami-

[WASHINGTON AND COMPANY]
Hamilton!

[LAFAYETTE]
Sir, you're gonna have to use him eventually
What's he gonna do on the bench? I mean-

[WASHINGTON AND COMPANY]
Hamilton!

[LAFAYETTE]
No one has more resilience
Or matches my practical tactical brilliance-

[WASHINGTON AND COMPANY]
Hamilton!
[LAFAYETTE]
You wanna fight for your land back?

[WASHINGTON]
I need my right hand man back!

[LAFAYETTE]
Ah! Uh, get ya right hand man back
You know you gotta get ya right hand man back

I mean you gotta put some thought into the letter but the sooner the better
To get your right hand man back!

[COMPANY]
Hamilton!

[WOMEN]
Hamilton!

Hamilton!

Hamilton, Hamilton!
Ha- ha-!

[MEN]
Get your right hand man back!

Your right hand man back!

Hamilton!
Ha-
Ha-

Hamilton, Hamilton!
Ha- ha-!

[WASHINGTON]
Alexander Hamilton
Troops are waiting in the field for you
If you join us right now, together we can turn the tide
Oh, Alexander Hamilton
I have soldiers who will yield for you
If we manage to get this right
They'll surrender by early light
The world will never be the same, Alexander...

History Has Its Eyes On You

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[WASHINGTON]
I was younger than you are now
When I was given my first command
I led my men straight into a massacre
I witnessed their deaths firsthand
I made every mistake
I felt the shame rise in me
And even now I lie awake
[WASHINGTON]
Knowing history has its eyes on me

[HAMILTON/WASHINGTON]
History has its eyes on me. [LAURENS/MULLIGAN]
Whoa...
Whoa...
Whoa...
Yeah

[COMPANY]
Whoa...
Whoa...
Whoa...
Yeah

[WASHINGTON]
Let me tell you what I wish I'd known
When I was young and dreamed of glory:
You have no control:

[WASHINGTON AND COMPANY]
Who lives, who dies, who tells your story

[WASHINGTON]
I know that we can win
I know that greatness lies in you
But remember from here on in
[WASHINGTON/HAMILTON AND MEN]
History has its
Eyes on you.

[ENSEMBLE]
Whoa...

Yorktown (The World Turned Upside Down)

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[COMPANY]
The battle of Yorktown. 1781

[LAFAYETTE]
Monsieur Hamilton

[HAMILTON]
Monsieur Lafayette

[LAFAYETTE]
In command where you belong

[HAMILTON]
How you say, no sweat
We're finally on the field. We've had quite a run

[LAFAYETTE]
Immigrants:

[HAMILTON/LAFAYETTE]
We get the job done

[HAMILTON]
So what happens if we win?

[LAFAYETTE]
I go back to France
I bring freedom to my people if I'm given the chance

[HAMILTON]
We'll be with you when you do

[LAFAYETTE]
Go lead your men

[HAMILTON]
See you on the other side

[LAFAYETTE]
‘Til we meet again, let's go!

[ENSEMBLE]
I am not throwin' away my shot!
I am not throwin' away my shot!
Hey yo, I'm just like my country, I'm young
Scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwin' away my shot!
I am not throwin' away my shot!

[HAMILTON]
‘Til the world turns upside down...

[ENSEMBLE]
‘Til the world turns upside down!

[HAMILTON]
I imagine death so much it feels more like a memory
This is where it gets me: on my feet
The enemy ahead of me
If this is the end of me, at least I have a friend with me
Weapon in my hand, a command, and my men with me
Then I remember my Eliza's expecting me...
Not only that, my Eliza's expecting
We gotta go, gotta get the job done
Gotta start a new nation, gotta meet my son!
Take the bullets out your gun!

[ENSEMBLE]
What?

[HAMILTON]
The bullets out your gun!

[ENSEMBLE]
What?

[HAMILTON]
We move under cover and we move as one
Through the night, we have one shot to live another day
We cannot let a stray gunshot give us away
We will fight up close, seize the moment and stay in it
It's either that or meet the business end of a bayonet
The code word is ‘Rochambeau,' dig me?

[ENSEMBLE]
Rochambeau!

[HAMILTON]
You have your orders now, go, man, go!
And so the American experiment begins
With my friends all scattered to the winds
Laurens is in South Carolina, redefining brav'ry

[HAMILTON/LAURENS]
We'll never be free until we end slavery!

[HAMILTON]
When we finally drive the British away
Lafayette is there waiting-

[HAMILTON/LAFAYETTE]
In Chesapeake Bay!

[HAMILTON]
How did we know that this plan would work?
We had a spy on the inside. That's right

[HAMILTON/COMPANY]
Hercules Mulligan!

[MULLIGAN]
A tailor spyin' on the British government!
I take their measurements, information and then I smuggle it

[COMPANY]
Up

[MULLIGAN]
To my brother's revolutionary covenant
I'm runnin' with the Sons of Liberty and I am lovin' it!
See, that's what happens when you up against the ruffians
We in the shit now, somebody gotta shovel it!
Hercules Mulligan, I need no introduction
When you knock me down I get the fuck back up again!

[COMPANY]
Left! Right! Hold!
Go!
What! What! What!

[HAMILTON]
After a week of fighting, a young man in a red coat stands on a parapet

[LAFAYETTE]
We lower our guns as he frantically waves a white handkerchief

[MULLIGAN]
And just like that, it's over. We tend to our wounded, we count our dead

[LAURENS]
Black and white soldiers wonder alike if this really means freedom

[WASHINGTON]
Not. Yet

[HAMILTON]
We negotiate the terms of surrender
I see George Washington smile
We escort their men out of Yorktown
They stagger home single file
Tens of thousands of people flood the streets
There are screams and church bells ringing
And as our fallen foes retreat
I hear the drinking song they're singing...

[ALL MEN]
The world turned upside down

[FULL COMPANY]
The world turned upside down
The world turned upside down
The world turned upside down
Down
Down, down, down

[LAFAYETTE]
Freedom for America, freedom for France!

[COMPANY]
Down, down, down

[HAMILTON]
Gotta start a new nation
Gotta meet my son

[COMPANY]
Down, down, down

[MULLIGAN]
We won!

[LAFAYETTE]
We won!

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE/LAURENS]
We won!

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE/LAURENS/HAMILTON/WASHINGTON]
We won!

What Comes Next

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[KING GEORGE]
They say
The price of my war's not a price that they're willing to pay
Insane
You cheat with the French, now I'm fighting with France and with Spain
I'm so blue
I thought that we'd made an arrangement
When you went away
You were mine to subdue
Well, even despite our estrangement, I've got
A small query for you:

What comes next?
You've been freed
Do you know how hard it is to lead?

You're on your own
Awesome. Wow
Do you have a clue what happens now?

Oceans rise
Empires fall
It's much harder when it's all your call

All alone, across the sea
When your people say they hate you, don't
Come crawling back to me

Da da da dat da dat da da da
Da ya da
Da da dat
Da da ya da...

You're on your own...

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[BURR]
Dear Theodosia, what to say to you?
You have my eyes. You have your mother's name

When you came into the world, you cried and it broke my heart

I'm dedicating every day to you
Domestic life was never quite my style
When you smile, you knock me out, I fall apart
And I thought I was so smart

You will come of age with our young nation
We'll bleed and fight for you, we'll make it right for you
If we lay a strong enough foundation
We'll pass it on to you, we'll give the world to you
And you'll blow us all away...
Someday, someday
Yeah, you'll blow us all away
Someday, someday

[HAMILTON]
Oh Philip, when you smile I am undone
My son
Look at my son. Pride is not the word I'm looking for

There is so much more inside me now
Oh Philip, you outshine the morning sun
My son
When you smile, I fall apart
And I thought I was so smart
My father wasn't around

[BURR]
My father wasn't around
[HAMILTON]
I swear that
I'll be around for you.
[BURR]
I'll be around for you.

[HAMILTON]
I'll do whatever it takes

[BURR]
I'll make a million mistakes

[BURR/HAMILTON]
I'll make the world safe and sound for you...
...will come of age with our young nation
We'll bleed and fight for you, we'll make it right for you

If we lay a strong enough foundation
We'll pass it on to you, we'll give the world to you
And you'll blow us all away...
Someday, someday
Yeah, you'll blow us all away
Someday, someday

Non-Stop

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[BURR]
After the war I went back to New York

[HAMILTON]
A-After the war I went back to New York

[BURR]
I finished up my studies and I practiced law

[HAMILTON]
I practiced law, Burr worked next door
[BURR]
Even though we started at the very same time
Alexander Hamilton began to climb
How to account for his rise to the top?
Maaaaan, the man is
Non-stop!

[ENSEMBLE]
Non-stop!

[HAMILTON]
Gentlemen of the jury, I'm curious, bear with me
Are you aware that we're making hist'ry?
This is the first murder trial of our brand-new nation
[HAMILTON]
The liberty behind
Deliberation-

[ENSEMBLE]
Non-stop!

[HAMILTON]
I intend to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt
With my assistant counsel-

[BURR]
Co-counsel
Hamilton, sit down
Our client Levi Weeks is innocent. Call your first witness
That's all you had to say!

[HAMILTON]
Okay!
One more thing-

[BURR]
Why do you assume you're the smartest in the room?
Why do you assume you're the smartest in the room?
Why do you assume you're the smartest in the room?
Soon that attitude may be your doom!

[ENSEMBLE]
Awwww!

[BURR]
Why do you write like you're running out of time?
Write day and night like you're running out of time?
Ev'ry day you fight, like you're running out of time

Keep on fighting. In the meantime- [ENSEMBLE]
Why do you write like you're running out of time?

Ev'ry day you fight, like you're running out of time

Non-stop!

[HAMILTON]
Corruption's such an old song that we can sing along in harmony
And nowhere is it stronger than in Albany
This colony's economy's increasingly stalling and

[HAMILTON]
Honestly, that's why public service
Seems to be calling me.

[BURR AND ENSEMBLE]
He's just
Non-stop!

[HAMILTON]
I practiced the law, I practic'ly perfected it
I've seen injustice in the world and I've corrected it
Now for a strong central democracy
If not, then I'll be Socrates
[HAMILTON]
Throwing verbal rocks
At these mediocrities.

[ENSEMBLE]
Awww!

[BURR]
Hamilton, at the Constitutional Convention:

[HAMILTON]
I was chosen for the Constitutional Convention

[BURR]
There as a New York junior delegate:
[HAMILTON]
Now what I'm going to say may sound indelicate...

[BURR]
Goes and proposes his own form of government!

His own plan for a new form of government!

[COMPANY]
Awwww!

What?

What?

[BURR]
Talks for six hours! The convention is listless!

[ENSEMBLE MAN]
Bright young man...

[ANOTHER ENSEMBLE MAN]
Yo, who the f is this?

[BURR]
Why do you always say what you believe?
Why do you always say what you believe?
Ev'ry proclamation guarantees free ammunition for your enemies!

[BURR AND MEN]
Why do you write like it's
Going out of style?
Write day and night like it's
Going out of style?

[COMPANY]
Why do you always say what you believe?
Awww!

[ALL WOMEN]
Going out of style, hey!
Going out of style, hey!

[BURR AND COMPANY]
Ev'ry day you fight like it's
Going out of style
Do what you do

[BURR]
Alexander?

[HAMILTON]
Aaron Burr, sir

[BURR]
It's the middle of the night

[HAMILTON]
Can we confer, sir?

[BURR]
Is this a legal matter?

HAMILTON
Yes, and it's important to me

[BURR]
What do you need?

[HAMILTON]
Burr, you're a better lawyer than me

[BURR]
Okay

[HAMILTON]
I know I talk too much, I'm abrasive
You're incredible in court. You're succinct, persuasive
My client needs a strong defense. You're the solution

[BURR]
Who's your client?

[HAMILTON]
The new U.S. Constitution?

[BURR]
No

[HAMILTON]
Hear me out

[BURR]
No way!

[HAMILTON]
A series of essays, anonymously published
Defending the document to the public

[BURR]
No one will read it

[HAMILTON]
I disagree

[BURR]
And if it fails?

[HAMILTON]
Burr, that's why we need it

[BURR]
The constitution's a mess

[HAMILTON]
So it needs amendments

[BURR]
It's full of contradictions

[HAMILTON]
So is independence
We have to start somewhere

[BURR]
No. No way

[HAMILTON]
You're making a mistake

[BURR]
Good night

[HAMILTON]
Hey
What are you waiting for?
What do you stall for?

[BURR]
What?

[HAMILTON]
We won the war
What was it all for?
Do you support this constitution?

[BURR]
Of course

[HAMILTON]
Then defend it

[BURR]
And what if you're backing the wrong horse?

[HAMILTON]
Burr, we studied and we fought and we killed
For the notion of a nation we now get to build
For once in your life, take a stand with pride
I don't understand how you stand to the side

[BURR]
I'll keep all my plans
Close to my chest

I'll wait here and see
Which way the wind
Will blow
I'm taking my time
Watching the
Afterbirth of a nation
Watching the tension grow.

[ENSEMBLE]
Wait for it, wait for
It, wait...

Which way the wind
Will blow
I'm taking my time
Watching the
Afterbirth of a nation
Watching the tension grow.

[ANGELICA]
I am sailing off to London. I'm accompanied by someone
Who always pays
I have found a wealthy husband who will keep
Me in comfort for all my days
He is not a lot of fun, but there's no one who
Can match you for turn of phrase
My Alexander

[HAMILTON]
Angelica

[ANGELICA]
Don't forget to write

[ELIZA]
Look at where you are
Look at where you started
The fact that you're alive is a miracle
Just stay alive, that would be enough
And if your wife could share a fraction of your time
If I could grant you peace of mind
Would that be enough?

[BURR]
Alexander joins forces with James Madison and John Jay to write a series of essays defending the new United States Constitution, entitled The Federalist Papers. The plan was to write a total of twenty-five essays, the work divided evenly among the three men. In the end, they wrote eighty-five essays, in the span of six months. John Jay got sick after writing five. James Madison wrote twenty-nine. Hamilton wrote the other fifty-one!

[BURR]
How do you write like you're
Running out of time?
Write day and night like you're
Running out of time?

[BURR AND MEN]
Ev'ry day you fight
Like you're
Running out of time
Like you're
Running out of time
Are you
Running out of time?
[ALL WOMEN]
Running out of time?
Running out of time?
Running out of time
Running out of time
Awwww!

[FULL COMPANY (EXCEPT HAMILTON)]
How do you write like tomorrow won't arrive?
How do you write like you need it to survive?
How do you write ev'ry second you're alive?
Ev'ry second you're alive? Ev'ry second you're alive?

[WASHINGTON]
They are asking me to lead
I am doing the best I can
To get the people that I need
I'm asking you to be my right hand man

[HAMILTON]
Treasury or State?

[WASHINGTON]
I know it's a lot to ask

[HAMILTON]
Treasury or State?

[WASHINGTON]
To leave behind the world you know...

[HAMILTON]
Sir, do you want me to run the Treasury or State department?

[WASHINGTON]
Treasury

[HAMILTON]
Let's go

[ELIZA]
Alexander...

[HAMILTON]
I have to leave

[ELIZA]
Alexander-

[HAMILTON]
Look around, look around at how lucky we are to be alive right now

[ELIZA]
Helpless...

[HAMILTON]
They are asking me to lead

[ELIZA]
Look around, isn't this enough?

[ANGELICA]
He will never be satisfied
He will never be satisfied
Satisfied
Satisfied...
He will never be satisfied
Satisfied[BURR]
How does a bastard, orphan, son of a whore and a
Scotsman, dropped in the middle of a
Forgotten spot in the Caribbean by providence
Impoverished, in squalor
Grow up to be a hero and a scholar?

[LAURENS]
The ten-dollar founding father without a father
Got a lot farther by working a lot harder
By being a lot smarter
By being a self-starter
By fourteen, they placed him in charge of a
Trading charter

[JEFFERSON]
And every day while slaves were being slaughtered and carted
Away across the waves, he struggled and kept his guard up
Inside, he was longing for something to be a part of
The brother was ready to beg, steal, borrow, or barter

[MADISON]
Then a hurricane came, and devastation reigned
Our man saw his future drip, dripping down the drain
Put a pencil to his temple, connected it to his brain
And he wrote his first refrain, a testament to his pain

[BURR]
Well, the word got around, they said, "This kid is insane, man"
Took up a collection just to send him to the mainland
"Get your education, don't forget from whence you came, and
The world is gonna know your name. What's your name, man?"

[HAMILTON]
Alexander Hamilton
My name is Alexander Hamilton
And there's a million things I haven't done
But just you wait, just you wait...

[ELIZA]
When he was ten his father split, full of it, debt-ridden
Two years later, see Alex and his mother bed-ridden
Half-dead sittin in their own sick, the scent thick

[COMPANY]
And Alex got better but his mother went quick

[WASHINGTON]
Moved in with a cousin, the cousin committed suicide
Left him with nothin' but ruined pride, something new inside
A voice saying
[WASHINGTON]
"You gotta fend for yourself." [COMPANY]
"Alex, you gotta fend for yourself."

[WASHINGTON]
He started retreatin' and readin' every treatise on the shelf
[BURR]
There would have been nothin' left to do
For someone less astute
He woulda been dead or destitute
Without a cent of restitution
Started workin', clerkin' for his late mother's landlord
Tradin' sugar cane and rum and all the things he can't afford
Scammin' for every book he can get his hands on
Plannin' for the future see him now as he stands on
The bow of a ship headed for a new land
In New York you can be a new man

[COMPANY]
In New York you can
Be a new man-
In New York you can
Be a new man-

[COMPANY]
Scammin'

Plannin'
Oooh...

[HAMILTON]
Just you wait!

Just you wait!

[COMPANY]
In New York you can be a new man-

[WOMEN]
In New York-

[MEN]
New York-

[HAMILTON]
Just you wait!
[COMPANY]
Alexander Hamilton

We are waiting in the wings for you

You could never back down
You never learned to take your time!

Oh, Alexander Hamilton

When America sings for you
Will they know what you overcame?
Will they know you rewrote the game?
The world will never be the same, oh

[BURR]
The ship is in the harbor now
See if you can spot him

Another immigrant
Comin' up from the bottom

His enemies destroyed his rep
America forgot him
[COMPANY]
Alexander Hamilton

Waiting in the wings for you

You never learned to take your time!

Oh, Alexander Hamilton
Alexander Hamilton...
America sings for you
Will they know what you overcame?
Will they know you rewrote the game?
The world will never be the same, oh

[MEN]
Just you wait

[COMPANY]
Just you wait

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE]
We fought with him

[LAURENS]
Me? I died for him

[WASHINGTON]
Me? I trusted him

[ELIZA/ANGELICA/MARIA]
Me? I loved him

[BURR]
And me? I'm the damn fool that shot him

[COMPANY]
There's a million things I haven't done
But just you wait!

[BURR]
What's your name, man?

[COMPANY]
Alexander Hamilton!

Aaron Burr, Sir

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[COMPANY]
1776. New York City

[HAMILTON]
Pardon me. Are you Aaron Burr, sir?

[BURR]
That depends. Who's asking?

[HAMILTON]
Oh, well, sure, sir
I'm Alexander Hamilton, I'm at your service, sir
I have been looking for you

[BURR]
I'm getting nervous

[HAMILTON]
Sir...
I heard your name at Princeton. I was seeking an accelerated course of study when I got sort of out of sorts with a buddy of yours. I may have punched him. It's a blur, sir. He handles the financials?

[BURR]
You punched the bursar

[HAMILTON]
Yes!
I wanted to do what you did. Graduate in two, then join the revolution. He looked at me like I was stupid, I'm not stupid

So how'd you do it? How'd you graduate so fast?

[BURR]
It was my parents' dying wish before they passed

[HAMILTON]
You're an orphan. Of course! I'm an orphan
God, I wish there was a war!
Then we could prove that we're worth more
Than anyone bargained for...

[BURR]
Can I buy you a drink?

[HAMILTON]
That would be nice

[BURR]
While we're talking, let me offer you some free advice
Talk less

[HAMILTON]
What?

[BURR]
Smile more

[HAMILTON]
Ha

[BURR]
Don't let them know what you're against or what you're for

[HAMILTON]
You can't be serious

[BURR]
You wanna get ahead?

[HAMILTON]
Yes

[BURR]
Fools who run their mouths off wind up dead

[LAURENS]
Yo yo yo yo yo!
What time is it?

[LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
Show time!

[BURR]
...like I said...

[LAURENS]
Show time! Show time! Yo!
I'm John Laurens in the place to be!
Two pints o' Sam Adams, but I'm workin' on three, uh!
Those redcoats don't want it with me!
Cuz I will pop chick-a pop these cops till I'm free!

[LAFAYETTE]
Oui oui, mon ami, je m'appelle Lafayette!
The Lancelot of the revolutionary set!
I came from afar just to say "Bonsoir!"
Tell the King "Casse toi!" Who's the best?
C'est moi!

[MULLIGAN]
Brrrah brraaah! I am Hercules Mulligan
Up in it, lovin' it, yes I heard ya mother said "Come again?"
Lock up ya daughters and horses, of course
It's hard to have intercourse over four sets of corsets...

[LAURENS]
No more sex, pour me another brew, son!
Let's raise a couple more...

[LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
To the revolution!

[LAURENS]
Well, if it ain't the prodigy of Princeton college!

[MULLIGAN]
Aaron Burr!

[LAURENS]
Give us a verse, drop some knowledge!

[BURR]
Good luck with that: you're takin' a stand
You spit. I'm ‘a sit. We'll see where we land

[LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
Boooo!

[LAURENS]
Burr, the revolution's imminent. What do you stall for?

[HAMILTON]
If you stand for nothing, Burr, what'll you fall for?
[LAURENS]
Ooh
Who are you? [MULLIGAN]
Ooh

Who are you? [LAFAYETTE]
Ooh

Who are you?

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE/LAURENS]
Ooh, who is this kid? What's he gonna do?

My Shot

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[HAMILTON]
I am not throwing away my shot!
I am not throwing away my shot!
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot!
I'm ‘a get a scholarship to King's College
I prob'ly shouldn't brag, but dag, I amaze and astonish
The problem is I got a lot of brains but no polish
I gotta holler just to be heard
With every word, I drop knowledge!
I'm a diamond in the rough, a shiny piece of coal
Tryin' to reach my goal. My power of speech: unimpeachable
Only nineteen but my mind is older
These New York City streets get colder, I shoulder
Ev'ry burden, ev'ry disadvantage
I have learned to manage, I don't have a gun to brandish
I walk these streets famished
The plan is to fan this spark into a flame
But damn, it's getting dark, so let me spell out the name
I am the-

[HAMILTON/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN/LAURENS]
A-L-E-X-A-N-D
E-R-we are-meant to be...

[HAMILTON]
A colony that runs independently
Meanwhile, Britain keeps shittin' on us endlessly
Essentially, they tax us relentlessly
Then King George turns around, runs a spending spree
He ain't ever gonna set his descendants free
So there will be a revolution in this century
Enter me!

[LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN/LAURENS]
(He says in parentheses)

[HAMILTON]
Don't be shocked when your hist'ry book mentions me
I will lay down my life if it sets us free
Eventually, you'll see my ascendancy
[HAMILTON]
And I am not throwing away
My shot
I am not throwing away
My shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot
[LAURENS]
My shot!

My shot!

And I'm not throwing away my shot.

[HAMILTON/MULLIGAN/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE]
I am not throwing away my shot
I am not throwing away my shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot
It's time to take a shot!

[LAFAYETTE]
I dream of life without a monarchy
The unrest in France will lead to ‘onarchy?
‘Onarchy? How you say, how you say, ‘anarchy?'
When I fight, I make the other side panicky
With my-

[HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
Shot!

[MULLIGAN]
Yo, I'm a tailor's apprentice
And I got y'all knuckleheads in loco parentis
I'm joining the rebellion cuz I know it's my chance
To socially advance, instead of sewin' some pants!
I'm gonna take a-

[HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
Shot!

[LAURENS]
But we'll never be truly free
Until those in bondage have the same rights as you and me
You and I. Do or die. Wait till I sally in
On a stallion with the first black battalion
Have another-

[HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
Shot!

[BURR]
Geniuses, lower your voices
You keep out of trouble and you double your choices
I'm with you, but the situation is fraught
You've got to be carefully taught:
If you talk, you're gonna get shot!

[HAMILTON]
Burr, check what we got
Mister Lafayette, hard rock like Lancelot
I think your pants look hot
Laurens, I like you a lot
Let's hatch a plot blacker than the kettle callin' the pot...
What are the odds the gods would put us all in one spot
Poppin' a squat on conventional wisdom, like it or not
A bunch of revolutionary manumission abolitionists?
Give me a position, show me where the ammunition is!

Oh, am I talkin' too loud?
Sometimes I get over excited, shoot off at the mouth
I never had a group of friends before
I promise that I'll make y'all proud

[LAURENS]
Let's get this guy in front of a crowd

[HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN/ENSEMBLE]
I am not throwing away my shot
I am not throwing away my shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot

I am not throwing away my shot
I am not throwing away my shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot
[LAURENS]
Ev'rybody sing:
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Hey!
Whoa!
Wooh!!
Whoa!
Ay, let ‘em hear ya!

Let's go!

I said shout it to the rooftops!

Whoa! Whoa!

[HAMILTON]
I imagine death so much it feels more like a memory
When's it gonna get me?
In my sleep? Seven feet ahead of me?
If I see it comin', do I run or do I let it be?
Is it like a beat without a melody?
See, I never thought I'd live past twenty
Where I come from some get half as many
Ask anybody why we livin' fast and we laugh, reach for a flask
We have to make this moment last, that's plenty

Scratch that
This is not a moment, it's the movement
Where all the hungriest brothers with
Something to prove went?
Foes oppose us, we take an honest stand
We roll like Moses, claimin' our promised land
And? If we win our independence?
‘Zat a guarantee of freedom for our descendants?
Or will the blood we shed begin an endless
Cycle of vengeance and death with no defendants?
I know the action in the street is excitin'
But Jesus, between all the bleedin' ‘n fightin'
I've been readin' ‘n writin'
We need to handle our financial situation
Are we a nation of states? What's the state of our nation?
I'm past patiently waitin'. I'm passionately
Smashin' every expectation
Every action's an act of creation!
I'm laughin' in the face of casualties and sorrow
For the first time, I'm thinkin' past tomorrow

[HAMILTON AND COMPANY]

Schuyler Sisters

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[BURR]
There's nothing rich folks love more
Than going downtown and slummin' it with the poor
They pull up in their carriages and gawk
At the students in the common
Just to watch them talk
Take Philip Schuyler: the man is loaded
Uh-oh, but little does he know that
His daughters, Peggy, Angelica, Eliza
Sneak into the city just to watch all the guys at-

[COMPANY]
Work, work!

Like I said, you're free to go

Ah, so you've discussed me

Farmer Refuted

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[SEABURY]
Hear ye, hear ye! My name is Samuel Seabury
And I present "Free Thoughts on the
Proceedings of the Continental Congress!"
Heed not the rabble who scream revolution
They have not your interests at heart

[MULLIGAN]
Oh my God. Tear this dude apart

[SEABURY]
Chaos and bloodshed are not a solution
Don't let them lead you astray
This Congress does not speak for me

[BURR]
Let him be

[SEABURY]
They're playing a dangerous game
I pray the king shows you his mercy
For shame, for shame...
[HAMILTON]
Yo!
He'd have you all unravel at the
Sound of screams but the
Revolution is comin'
The have-nots are gonna
Win this
It's hard to listen to you with a straight face

Chaos and bloodshed already haunt us, honestly you shouldn't even talk. And what about Boston? Look at the cost, n' all that we've lost n' you talk
About Congress?!

My dog speaks more eloquently than thee!

But strangely, your mange is the same

Is he in Jersey?

For the revolution!
[SEABURY]
Heed not the rabble
Who scream
Revolution, they
Have not your
Interests
At heart

Chaos and bloodshed are
Not a
Solution. Don't
Let them lead you
Astray
This Congress does not
Speak for me

They're playing a dangerous game

I pray the king shows you his mercy

For shame

For shame,

[COMPANY]
For the revolution!

[SEABURY]
Heed-

[HAMILTON]
If you repeat yourself again I'm gonna-

[SEABURY/HAMILTON]
Scream-

[HAMILTON]
Honestly, look at me, please don't read!

[SEABURY]
Not your interests-

[HAMILTON]
Don't modulate the key then not debate with me!
Why should a tiny island across the sea regulate the price of tea?

[BURR]
Alexander, please!

[HAMILTON]
Burr, I'd rather be divisive than indecisive, drop the niceties

Silence! A message from the King!

You'll Be Back

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[KING GEORGE]
You say
The price of my love's not a price that you're willing to pay
You cry
In your tea which you hurl in the sea when you see me go by
Why so sad?
Remember we made an arrangement when you went away
Now you're making me mad
Remember, despite our estrangement, I'm your man
You'll be back
Soon you'll see
You'll remember you belong to me
You'll be back
Time will tell
You'll remember that I served you well
Oceans rise
Empires fall
We have seen each other through it all
And when push
Comes to shove
I will send a fully armed battalion
To remind you of my love!

Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da
Da da dat dat da ya da!
Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da
Da da dat dat da...

You say our love is draining and you can't go on
You'll be the one complaining when I am gone...
And no, don't change the subject
Cuz you're my favorite subject
My sweet, submissive subject
My loyal, royal subject
Forever and ever and ever and ever and ever...

You'll be back
Like before
I will fight the fight and win the war
For your love
For your praise
And I'll love you till my dying days
When you're gone
I'll go mad
So don't throw away this thing we had

Cuz when push comes to shove
I will kill your friends and family to remind you of my love
Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da
Da da dat dat da ya da!
Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da
Da da dat-
Everybody!

[ENSEMBLE]
Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da
Da da dat dat da ya da!
Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da da da da
Dat dat da ya da!

As a kid in the Caribbean I wished for a war
I knew that I was poor
I knew it was the only way to-

[HAMILTON/BURR/MULLIGAN/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE]
Rise up!

[HAMILTON]
If they tell my story
I am either gonna die on the battlefield in glory or-

[HAMILTON/BURR/MULLIGAN/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE]
Rise up!

[HAMILTON]
We will fight for this land
But there's only one man
Who can give us a command so we can-

[HAMILTON/BURR/MULLIGAN/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE]
Rise up!

[HAMILTON]
Understand? It's the only way to-

We gotta make an all out stand
Ayo, I'm gonna need a right-hand man.
ENSEMBLE
What?

What?

Buck, buck, buck, buck, buck!

Buck, buck, buck, buck, buck!

[WASHINGTON]
Check it-
Can I be real a second?
For just a millisecond?
Let down my guard and tell the people how I feel a second?
Now I'm the model of a modern major general
The venerated Virginian veteran whose men are all
Lining up, to put me up on a pedestal
Writin' letters to relatives
Embellishin' my elegance and eloquence
But the elephant is in the room
The truth is in ya face when ya hear the British cannons go...

[ENSEMBLE]
Boom!

[WASHINGTON]
Any hope of success is fleeting
How can I keep leading when the people I'm
Leading keep retreating?
We put a stop to the bleeding as the British take Brooklyn
Knight takes rook, but look
[WASHINGTON]
We are outgunned

Outmanned

Outnumbered
Outplanned

We gotta make an all out stand
Ayo, I'm gonna need a right-hand man

Incoming!
[ENSEMBLE]

Buck, buck, buck, buck, buck!

Buck, buck, buck, buck, buck!

They're battering down the Battery check the damages

[MULLIGAN]

[HAMILTON]
We gotta stop ‘em and rob ‘em of their advantages

[MULLIGAN]

[HAMILTON]
Let's take a stand with the stamina God has granted us
Hamilton won't abandon ship
Yo, let's steal their cannons-
[MULLIGAN]
Shh-boom! [COMPANY]
Boom!

[WASHINGTON]
Goes the cannon, watch the blood and the shit spray and...

[COMPANY]
Boom!

[WASHINGTON]
Goes the cannon, we're abandonin' Kips Bay and...

[COMPANY]
Boom!

[WASHINGTON]
There's another ship and...

[COMPANY]
Boom!

[WASHINGTON]
We just lost the southern tip and...

[COMPANY]
Boom!

[WASHINGTON]
We gotta run to Harlem quick, we can't afford another slip
Guns and horses giddyup
I decide to divvy up
My forces, they're skittish as the British cut the city up
This close to giving up, facing mad scrutiny
I scream in the face of this mass mutiny:
Are these the men with which I am to defend America?
We ride at midnight, Manhattan in the distance
I cannot be everywhere at once, people
I'm in dire need of assistance...

[BURR]
Your excellency, sir!

[WASHINGTON]
Who are you?

[BURR]
Aaron Burr, Sir?
Permission to state my case?

[WASHINGTON]
As you were

[BURR]
Sir
I was a captain under General Montgomery
Until he caught a bullet in the neck in Quebec
And well, in summary
I think that I could be of some assistance
I admire how you keep firing on the British
From a distance

[WASHINGTON]
Huh

[BURR]
I have some questions, a couple of suggestions on how to fight instead of fleeing west

[WASHINGTON]
Yes?

[BURR]
Well-

[HAMILTON]
Your excellency, you wanted to see me?

[WASHINGTON]
Hamilton, come in, have you met Burr?

[HAMILTON]
Yes, sir

[HAMILTON AND BURR]
We keep meeting

[BURR]
As I was saying, sir, I look forward to seeing your strategy play out

[WASHINGTON]
Burr?

[BURR]
Sir?

[WASHINGTON]
Close the door on your way out

[HAMILTON]
Have I done something wrong, sir?

[WASHINGTON]
On the contrary
I called you here because our odds are beyond scary
Your reputation precedes you, but I have to laugh

[HAMILTON]
Sir?

[WASHINGTON]
Hamilton, how come no one can get you on their staff?

[HAMILTON]
Sir!

[WASHINGTON]
Don't get me wrong, you're a young man, of great renown
I know you stole British cannons when we were still downtown
Nathaniel Green and Henry Knox wanted to hire you...

[HAMILTON]
To be their Secretary? I don't think so

[WASHINGTON]
Why're you upset?

[HAMILTON]
I'm not-

[WASHINGTON]
It's alright, you want to fight, you've got a hunger
I was just like you when I was younger
Head full of fantasies of dyin' like a martyr?

[HAMILTON]
Yes

[WASHINGTON]
Dying is easy, young man. Living is harder

[HAMILTON]
Why are you telling me this?

[WASHINGTON]
I'm being honest
I'm working with a third of what our Congress has promised
We are a powder keg about to explode
I need someone like you to lighten the load. So?

[COMPANY (EXCEPT HAMILTON)]
I am not throwin' away my shot!
I am not throwin' away my shot!
Ayo, I'm just like my country, I'm young
Scrappy and hungry!

[HAMILTON]
I am not throwing away my shot!

[WASHINGTON]
Son

[WASHINGON AND COMPANY]
We are outgunned, outmanned!

[HAMILTON]
You need all the help you can get
I have some friends. Laurens, Mulligan
Marquis de Lafayette, okay, what else?

[WASHINGTON AND COMPANY]
Outnumbered, outplanned!

[HAMILTON]
We'll need some spies on the inside
Some King's men who might let some things slide
[HAMILTON]
I'll write to Congress and tell ‘em we need supplies, you rally the guys, master the element of surprise

I'll rise above my station, organize your information, ‘til we rise to the occasion of our new nation. Sir!

[ENSEMBLE]
Here comes the General!

[HAMILTON]

A Winter's Ball

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[BURR]
How does the bastard, orphan, son of a whore
Go on and on
Grow into more of a phenomenon?
Watch this obnoxious, arrogant, loudmouth bother
Be seated at the right hand of the father
Washington hires Hamilton right on sight
But Hamilton still wants to fight, not write
Now Hamilton's skill with a quill is undeniable
But what do we have in common? We're
Reliable with the

[ALL MEN]
Ladies!

[BURR]
There are so many to deflower!

[ALL MEN]
Ladies!

[BURR]
Looks! Proximity to power

They delighted and distracted him
Martha Washington named her feral tomcat after him!

[HAMILTON]
That's true

1780

[BURR]
A winter's ball
And the Schuyler sisters are the envy of all
Yo, if you can marry a sister, you're rich, son

Is it a question of if, Burr, or which one?

Helpless

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[HAMILTON/BURR/LAURENS/ALL WOMEN (EXCEPT ELIZA)]
Hey hey hey hey

Ohh, I do I do I do I
Dooo! Hey!
Ohh, I do I do I do I
Dooo! Boy you got me [ALL WOMEN]
Hey hey hey hey
Hey hey hey hey
Hey hey hey hey
Hey hey hey

[ELIZA AND WOMEN]
Helpless!
Look into your eyes, and the sky's the limit I'm helpless!
Down for the count, and I'm drownin' in ‘em

[ELIZA]
I have never been the type to try and grab the spotlight
We were at a revel with some rebels on a hot night
Laughin' at my sister as she's dazzling the room
Then you walked in and my heart went "Boom!"
Tryin' to catch your eye from the side of the ballroom
Everybody's dancin' and the band's top volume

[ELIZA AND WOMEN]
Grind to the rhythm as we wine and dine
[ELIZA]
Grab my sister, and
Whisper, "Yo, this
One's mine."

My sister made her way across the room to you
And I got nervous, thinking "What's she gonna do?"
She grabbed you by the arm, I'm thinkin' "I'm through"
Then you look back at me and suddenly I'm
Helpless!

Oh, look at those eyes

Oh!
Yeah, I'm
Helpless, I know

I'm so into you
I am so into you

I know I'm down for the count
And I'm drownin' in ‘em.

[ALL WOMEN]
Oooh

Oooh

Oooh

Oooh

Helpless!

Look into your eyes

Down for the count
And I'm drownin' in ‘em

I'm helpless!

Look into your eyes
And the sky's the limit I'm helpless!

Down for the count
And I'm drownin' in ‘em.

[HAMILTON]
Where are you taking me?

[ANGELICA]
I'm about to change your life

[HAMILTON]
Then by all means, lead the way

[ELIZA]
Elizabeth Schuyler. It's a pleasure to meet you

[HAMILTON]
Schuyler?

[ANGELICA]
My sister

[ELIZA]
Thank you for all your service

[HAMILTON]
If it takes fighting a war for us to meet, it will have been worth it

[ANGELICA]
I'll leave you to it

[ELIZA AND WOMEN]
One week later

[ELIZA]
I'm writin' a letter nightly
Now my life gets better, every letter that you write me
Laughin' at my sister, cuz she wants to form a harem

[ANGELICA]
I'm just sayin', if you really loved me, you would share him
[ELIZA]
Ha!
Two weeks later
In the living room stressin'
My father's stone-faced
While you're asking for his blessin'
I'm dying inside, as
You wine
And dine
And I'm tryin' not to cry
‘cause there's nothing that your mind can't do
My father makes his way across the room
To you
I panic for a second, thinking
"we're through"
But then he shakes your hand and says
"Be true"
And you turn back to me, smiling, and I'm
Helpless!

Helpless!
Hoo!

That boy is mine
That boy is mine!

Helpless! Helpless!
Down for the count
And I'm drownin' in em

[ALL WOMEN]
Stressin'

Blessin'

And I'm drownin' in

Helpless!

Look into your eyes
And the sky's the
Limit I'm
Helpless!
Down for the count
And I'm drownin' in em

[HAMILTON]
Eliza, I don't have a dollar to my name
An acre of land, a troop to command, a dollop of fame
All I have's my honor, a tolerance for pain
A couple of college credits and my top-notch brain
Insane, your family brings out a different side of me
Peggy confides in me, Angelica tried to take a bite of me
No stress, my love for you is never in doubt
We'll get a little place in Harlem and we'll figure it out
I've been livin' without a family since I was a child
My father left, my mother died, I grew up buckwild
But I'll never forget my mother's face, that was real
And long as I'm alive, Eliza, swear to God
You'll never feel so...

[HAMILTON]
Eliza...

I've never felt so-

My life is gon' be fine cuz Eliza's in it.
[ELIZA]
I do I do I do I do!

I do I do I do I do!

Hey, yeah, yeah!

I'm down for the count
I'm-

I look into your eyes, and the sky's the limit
I'm

...drownin' in ‘em. [ALL WOMEN]
Helpless!

Helpless!

Satisfied

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[LAURENS]
Alright, alright. That's what I'm talkin' about!
Now everyone give it up for the maid of honor
Angelica Schuyler!
[ANGELICA]
A toast to the groom!

To the bride!

From your sister

Who is always by your side

To your union

And the hope that you provide

May you always...

Be satisfied.

[ALL MEN]
To the groom!
To the groom!
To the groom!

To the bride!
To the bride!

Angelica!
Angelica!
Angelica!

By your side!

To the union!
To the revolution!

You provide!

[HAMILTON AND MEN]
Always-

Rewind-

[ALL WOMEN]
To the groom!

To the bride!

To the bride!

[ELIZA AND WOMEN]
Angelica!

By your side!

To the union!
To the revolution!

You provide!

Always-

Rewind-

[ANGELICA]
I remember that night, I just might
Regret that night for the rest of my days

I remember those soldier boys
Tripping over themselves to win our praise

I remember that dreamlike candlelight
Like a dream that you can't quite place

But Alexander, I'll never forget the first
Time I saw your face

I have never been the same
Intelligent eyes in a hunger-pang frame
And when you said "Hi," I forgot my dang name
Set my heart aflame, ev'ry part aflame

[FULL COMPANY]
This is not a game...

[HAMILTON]
You strike me as a woman who has never been satisfied

[ANGELICA]
I'm sure I don't know what you mean. You forget yourself

[HAMILTON]
You're like me. I'm never satisfied

[ANGELICA]
Is that right?

[HAMILTON]
I have never been satisfied

[ANGELICA]
My name is Angelica Schuyler

[HAMILTON]
Alexander Hamilton

[ANGELICA]
Where's your fam'ly from?

[HAMILTON]
Unimportant. There's a million things I haven't done but
Just you wait, just you wait...

[ANGELICA]
So so so-
So this is what it feels like to match wits
With someone at your level! What the hell is the catch? It's
The feeling of freedom, of seein' the light
It's Ben Franklin with a key and a kite! You see it, right?
The conversation lasted two minutes, maybe three minutes
Ev'rything we said in total agreement, it's
A dream and it's a bit of a dance
A bit of a posture, it's a bit of a stance. He's a
Bit of a flirt, but I'm ‘a give it a chance
I asked about his fam'ly, did you see his answer?
His hands started fidgeting, he looked askance?
He's penniless, he's flying by the seat of his pants

Handsome, boy, does he know it!
Peach fuzz, and he can't even grow it!
I wanna take him far away from this place
Then I turn and see my sister's face and she is...

[ELIZA]
Helpless...

[ANGELICA]
And I know she is...

[ELIZA]
Helpless...

[ANGELICA]
And her eyes are just...

[ELIZA]
Helpless...

[ANGELICA]
And I realize

[ANGELICA AND COMPANY]
Three fundamental truths at the exact same time...

[HAMILTON]
Where are you taking me?

[ANGELICA]
I'm about to change your life

[HAMILTON]
Then by all means, lead the way

[COMPANY (EXCEPT ANGELICA)]
Number one!

[ANGELICA]
I'm a girl in a world in which
My only job is to marry rich
My father has no sons so I'm the one
Who has to social climb for one
So I'm the oldest and the wittiest and the gossip in
New York City is insidious
Alexander is penniless
Ha! That doesn't mean I want him any less

[ELIZA]
Elizabeth Schuyler. It's a pleasure to meet you

[HAMILTON]
Schuyler?

[ANGELICA]
My sister

[COMPANY]
Number two!

[ANGELICA]
He's after me cuz I'm a Schuyler sister
That elevates his status, I'd
Have to be naïve to set that aside
Maybe that is why I introduce him to Eliza
Now that's his bride
Nice going, Angelica, he was right
You will never be satisfied

[ELIZA]
Thank you for all your service

[HAMILTON]
If it takes fighting a war for us to meet, it will have been worth it

[ANGELICA]
I'll leave you to it

[COMPANY]
Number three!

[ANGELICA]
I know my sister like I know my own mind
You will never find anyone as trusting or as kind
If I tell her that I love him she'd be silently resigned
He'd be mine
She would say, "I'm fine"

[ANGELICA AND COMPANY]
She'd be lying

[ANGELICA]
But when I fantasize at night
It's Alexander's eyes
As I romanticize what might
Have been if I hadn't sized him
Up so quickly
At least my dear Eliza's his wife;
At least I keep his eyes in my life...
[ANGELICA]
To the groom!

To the bride!

From your sister

Who is always by your side

To your union

And the hope that you provide

May you always

Be satisfied

And I know

She'll be happy as

His bride
And I know [ALL MEN (EXCEPT HAMILTON)]
To the groom!
To the groom!
To the groom!

To the bride!
To the bride!

Angelica!
Angelica!

By your side

To the union!
To the revolution!

You provide!
You provide!

[HAMILTON AND MEN]
Always-

Be satisfied

Be satisfied

[MEN]
Be satisfied
Be satisfied
Be satisfied
Be satisfied

Be satisfied
Be satisfied

Be satisfied
Be satisfied
Be satisfied
Be satisfied.

[ALL WOMEN (EXCEPT ELIZA)]
To the groom!

The Story of Tonight (Reprise)

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[LAURENS]
I may not live to see our glory!

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE]
I may not live to see our glory!

[LAURENS]
But I've seen wonders great and small

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE]
I've seen wonders great and small

[LAURENS]
‘Cause if the tomcat can get married

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE]
If Alexander can get married-

[LAURENS]
There's hope for our ass, after all!

[LAFAYETTE]
Raise a glass to freedom

[LAURENS/MULLIGAN]
Hey!
Something you will never see again!

[MULLIGAN]
No matter what she tells you

[LAFAYETTE]
Let's have another round tonight!

[LAURENS]
Raise a glass to the four of us!

[LAFAYETTE/HAMILTON]
Ho!

[MULLIGAN]
To the newly not poor of us!

[LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/HAMILTON]
Woo!

[LAFAYETTE]
We'll tell the story of tonight

[LAURENS]
Let's have another round-

[HAMILTON]
Well, if it isn't Aaron Burr

[BURR]
Sir!

[HAMILTON]
I didn't think that you would make it

[BURR]
To be sure

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE]
Burr!

[BURR]
I came to say congratulations

[MULLIGAN]
Spit a verse, Burr!

[BURR]
I see the whole gang is here

[LAFAYETTE]
You are the worst, Burr!

[HAMILTON]
Ignore them. Congrats to you, Lieutenant Colonel
I wish I had your command instead of manning George's journal

[BURR]
No, you don't

[HAMILTON]
Yes, I do

[BURR]
Now, be sensible
From what I hear, you've made yourself indispensable

[LAURENS]
Well, well, I heard
You've got a special someone on the side, Burr

[HAMILTON]
Is that so?

[LAURENS]
What are you tryin' to hide, Burr?

[BURR]
I should go

[HAMILTON]
No, these guys should go

[LAFAYETTE]
What?

[LAURENS]
No!

[HAMILTON]
Leave us alone

[MULLIGAN]
Man...

[HAMILTON]
It's alright, Burr. I wish you'd brought this girl with you tonight, Burr

[BURR]
You're very kind, but I'm afraid it's unlawful, sir

[HAMILTON]
What do you mean?

[BURR]
She's married

[HAMILTON]
I see

[BURR]
She's married to a British officer

[HAMILTON]
Oh shit...

[BURR]
Congrats again, Alexander. Smile more
I'll see you on the other side of the war

[HAMILTON]
I will never understand you
If you love this woman, go get her! What are you waiting for?

[BURR]
I'll see you on the other side of the war

[HAMILTON]
I'll see you on the other side of the war

Wait For It

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[BURR]
Theodosia writes me a letter everyday
I'm keeping the bed warm while her husband is away
He's on the British side in Georgia
He's trying to keep the colonies in line
But he can keep all of Georgia
Theodosia, she's mine

Love doesn't discriminate
Between the sinners
And the saints
It takes and it takes and it takes
And we keep loving anyway
We laugh and we cry
And we break
And we make our mistakes
And if there's a reason I'm by her side
When so many have tried
Then I'm willing to wait for it
I'm willing to wait for it
[BURR]
My grandfather was a fire and brimstone preacher

But there are things that the
Homilies and hymns won't teach ya

My mother was a genius

My father commanded respect

When they died they left no instructions
Just a legacy to protect

[MEN]
Preacher, preacher
Preacher

Teach ya, teach ya, teach ya

Respect, respect

[WOMEN]
Genius

[BURR/ENSEMBLE]
Death doesn't discriminate
Between the sinners
And the saints
It takes and it takes and it takes
And we keep living anyway
We rise and we fall
And we break
And we make our mistakes
And if there's a reason I'm still alive
When everyone who loves me has died
I'm willing to wait for it
I'm willing to wait for it

Wait for it

[ENSEMBLE]
Wait for it
Wait for it
Wait for it

[BURR]
I am the one thing in life I can control

[ENSEMBLE]
Wait for it
Wait for it
Wait for it

[BURR]
I am inimitable
I am an original

[ENSEMBLE]
Wait for it
Wait for it

[BURR]
I'm not falling behind or running late

[ENSEMBLE]
Wait for it
Wait for it
Wait for it

[BURR]
I'm not standing still
I am lying in wait

[ENSEMBLE]
Wait

[BURR]
Hamilton faces an endless uphill climb

[ENSEMBLE]
Climb
Climb
Climb

[BURR]
He has something to prove
He has nothing to lose

[ENSEMBLE]
Lose
Lose
Lose
Lose

[BURR]
Hamilton's pace is relentless
He wastes no time

[ENSEMBLE]
Time
Time
Time

[BURR]
What is it like in his shoes?

Hamilton doesn't hesitate
He exhibits no restraint
He takes and he takes and he takes
And he keeps winning anyway
He changes the game
He plays and he raises the stakes
And if there's a reason
He seems to thrive when so few survive, then Goddamnit-
[BURR]
I'm willing to wait for it

I'm willing to wait for it...

Life doesn't discriminate
Between the sinners and the saints
It takes and it takes and it takes

We rise
We fall

And if there's a reason I'm still alive
When so many have died
Then I'm willin' to-
[COMPANY]
I'm willing to wait for it
Wait for it

I'm willing to-

Life doesn't discriminate
Between the sinners and the saints
It takes and it takes and it takes
And we keep living anyway
We rise and we fall and we break
And we make our mistakes
And if there's a reason I'm still alive
When so many have died
Then I'm willin' to-

Stay Alive

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[ELIZA]
Stay alive...

[ELIZA/ANGELICA/ENSEMBLE WOMEN]
Stay alive...

[HAMILTON]
I have never seen the General so despondent
I have taken over writing all his correspondence
Congress writes, "George, attack the British forces."
I shoot back, we have resorted to eating our horses
Local merchants deny us equipment, assistance
They only take British money, so sing a song of sixpence

[WASHINGTON]
The cavalry's not coming

[HAMILTON]
Sir!

[WASHINGTON]
Alex, listen. There's only one way for us to win this
Provoke outrage, outright

[HAMILTON]
That's right

[WASHINGTON]
Don't engage, strike by night
Remain relentless ‘til their troops take flight

[HAMILTON]
Make it impossible to justify the cost of the fight

[WASHINGTON]
Outrun

[HAMILTON]
Outrun

[WASHINGTON]
Outlast

[HAMILTON]
Outlast

[WASHINGTON]
Hit ‘em quick, get out fast

[HAMILTON]
Chick-a-plao!

[WASHINGTON]
Stay alive ‘til this horror show is past
We're gonna fly a lot of flags half-mast

[HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE]
Raise a glass!

[MULLIGAN]
I go back to New York and my apprenticeship

[LAFAYETTE]
I ask for French aid, I pray that France has sent a ship

[LAURENS]
I stay at work with Hamilton
We write essays against slavery
And every day's a test of our camaraderie
And bravery

[HAMILTON]
We cut supply lines, we steal contraband
We pick and choose our battles and places to take a stand
And ev'ry day
"Sir, entrust me with a command,"
And ev'ry day

[WASHINGTON]
No

[HAMILTON]
He dismisses me out of hand
[HAMILTON]
Instead of me
He promotes
Charles Lee
Makes him second-in-command:

[LEE]
Charles Lee. [ELIZA/ANGELICA]
Stay alive...

[LEE]
I'm a General. Whee!!!!

[HAMILTON]
Yeah. He's not the choice I would have gone with

[HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE]
He shits the bed at the Battle of Monmouth

[WASHINGTON]
Ev'ryone attack!

[LEE]
Retreat!

[WASHINGTON]
Attack!

[LEE]
Retreat!

[WASHINGTON]
What are you doing, Lee? Get back on your feet!

[LEE]
But there's so many of them!

[WASHINGTON]
I'm sorry, is this not your speed?!
Hamilton!

[HAMILTON]
Ready, sir!

[WASHINGTON]
Have Lafayette take the lead!

[HAMILTON]
Yes, sir!

[LAURENS]
A thousand soldiers die in a hundred degree heat

[LAFAYETTE]
As we snatch a stalemate from the jaws of defeat

[HAMILTON]
Charles Lee was left behind
Without a pot to piss in
He started sayin' this to anybody who would listen:

[LEE]
Washington cannot be left alone to his devices
Indecisive, from crisis to crisis
The best thing he can do for the revolution
Is turn n' go back to plantin' tobacco in Mount Vernon

[COMPANY]
Oo!!

[WASHINGTON]
Don't do a thing. History will prove him wrong

[HAMILTON]
But, sir!

[WASHINGTON]
We have a war to fight, let's move along

[LAURENS]
Strong words from Lee, someone oughta hold him to it

[HAMILTON]
I can't disobey direct orders

[LAURENS]
Then I'll do it
Alexander, you're the closest friend I've got

[HAMILTON]
Laurens, do not throw away your shot

Ten Duel Commandments

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[MEN]
One, two, three, four

[FULL COMPANY]
Five, six, seven, eight, nine...

[BURR/HAMILTON/LAURENS/LEE]
It's the Ten Duel Commandments

[FULL COMPANY]
It's the Ten Duel Commandments
Number one!

[LAURENS]
The challenge: demand satisfaction
If they apologize, no need for further action

[COMPANY]
Number two!

[LAURENS]
If they don't, grab a friend, that's your second

[HAMILTON]
Your lieutenant when there's reckoning to be reckoned

[COMPANY]
Number three!

[LEE]
Have your seconds meet face to face

[BURR]
Negotiate a peace...

[HAMILTON]
Or negotiate a time and place

[BURR]
This is commonplace, ‘specially ‘tween recruits

[COMPANY]
Most disputes die, and no one shoots
Number four!

[LAURENS]
If they don't reach a peace, that's alright
Time to get some pistols and a doctor on site

[HAMILTON]
You pay him in advance, you treat him with civility

[BURR]
You have him turn around so he can have deniability

[COMPANY]
Five!

[LEE]
Duel before the sun is in the sky

[COMPANY]
Pick a place to die where it's high and dry
Number six!

[HAMILTON]
Leave a note for your next of kin
Tell ‘em where you been. Pray that hell or heaven lets you in

[COMPANY]
Seven!

[LEE]
Confess your sins. Ready for the moment of adrenaline when you finally face your opponent

[COMPANY]
Number eight!

[LAURENS/LEE/HAMILTON/BURR]
Your last chance to negotiate
Send in your seconds, see if they can set the record straight...

[BURR]
Alexander

[HAMILTON]
Aaron Burr, sir

[BURR]
Can we agree that duels are dumb and immature?

[HAMILTON]
Sure
But your man has to answer for his words, Burr

[BURR]
With his life? We both know that's absurd, sir

[HAMILTON]
Hang on, how many men died because Lee was inexperienced and ruinous?

[BURR]
Okay, so we're doin' this

[COMPANY]
Number nine!

[HAMILTON]
Look ‘em in the eye, aim no higher
Summon all the courage you require
Then count

[MEN]
One two three four

[FULL COMPANY]
Five six seven eight nine

[HAMILTON/BURR]
Number

[COMPANY]
Ten paces!

[HAMILTON/BURR]
Fire!

Meet Me Inside

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[HAMILTON]
Lee, do you yield?

[BURR]
You shot him in the side!
Yes, he yields!

[LAURENS]
I'm satisfied

[BURR]
Yo, we gotta clear the field!

[HAMILTON]
Go! We won

[COMPANY]
Here comes the General!

[BURR]
This should be fun

[WASHINGTON]
What is the meaning of this? Mr. Burr, get a medic for the General

[BURR]
Yes, sir

[WASHINGTON]
Lee, you will never agree with me
But believe me, these young men don't speak for me
Thank you for your service

[BURR]
Let's ride!

[WASHINGTON]
Hamilton!

[HAMILTON]
Sir!

[WASHINGTON]
Meet me inside

[COMPANY]
Meet him inside! Meet him inside!
Meet him inside, meet him, meet him inside!

[WASHINGTON]
Son-

[HAMILTON]
Don't call me son

[WASHINGTON]
This war is hard enough
Without infighting-

[HAMILTON]
Lee called you out. We called his bluff

[WASHINGTON]
You solve nothing, you aggravate our allies to the south

[HAMILTON]
You're absolutely right, John should have shot him in the mouth
That would've shut him up

[WASHINGTON]
Son-

[HAMILTON]
I'm notcha son-

[WASHINGTON]
Watch your tone
I am not a maiden in need of defending, I am grown

[HAMILTON (OVERLAPPING)]
Charles Lee, Thomas Conway
These men take your name and they rake it
Through the mud

[WASHINGTON]
My name's been through a lot, I can take it

[HAMILTON]
Well, I don't have your name. I don't have your titles
I don't have your land
But, if you-

[WASHINGTON]
No-

[HAMILTON]
If you gave me command of a battalion, a group of men to lead, I could fly above my station after the war

[WASHINGTON]
Or you could die and we need you alive

[HAMILTON]
I'm more than willing to die-

[WASHINGTON]
Your wife needs you alive, son, I need you alive-

[HAMILTON]
Call me son one more time-

[WASHINGTON]
Go home, Alexander
That's an order from your commander

[HAMILTON]
Sir-

[WASHINGTON]
Go home

That Would Be Enough

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[ELIZA]
Look around, look around at how lucky we are
To be alive right now
Look around, look around...

[HAMILTON]
How long have you known?

[ELIZA]
A month or so

[HAMILTON]
Eliza, you should have told me

[ELIZA]
I wrote to the General a month ago

[HAMILTON]
No

[ELIZA]
I begged him to send you home

[HAMILTON]
You should have told me

[ELIZA]
I'm not sorry
[ELIZA]
I knew you'd fight
Until the war was won

But you deserve a chance to meet your son
Look around, look around at how lucky we are
To be alive right now.
[HAMILTON]
The war's not
Done.

[HAMILTON]
Will you relish being a poor man's wife
Unable to provide for your life?

[ELIZA]
I relish being your wife
Look around, look around...

Look at where you are
Look at where you started
The fact that you're alive is a miracle
Just stay alive, that would be enough

And if this child
Shares a fraction of your smile
Or a fragment of your mind, look out world!
That would be enough

I don't pretend to know
The challenges you're facing
The worlds you keep erasing and creating in your mind

But I'm not afraid
I know who I married
So long as you come home at the end of the day
That would be enough

We don't need a legacy
We don't need money
If I could grant you peace of mind

If you could let me inside your heart...
Oh, let me be a part of the narrative
In the story they will write someday
Let this moment be the first chapter:
Where you decide to stay
And I could be enough
And we could be enough
That would be enough

Guns and Ships

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[BURR]
How does a ragtag volunteer army in need of a shower
Somehow defeat a global superpower?
How do we emerge victorious from the quagmire?
Leave the battlefield waving Betsy Ross' flag higher?
Yo. Turns out we have a secret weapon!
An immigrant you know and love who's unafraid to step in!
He's constantly confusin', confoundin' the British henchmen
Ev'ryone give it up for America's favorite fighting Frenchman!

[COMPANY]
Lafayette!

[LAFAYETTE]
I'm takin this horse by the reins makin'
Redcoats redder with bloodstains

[COMPANY]
Lafayette!

[LAFAYETTE]
And I'm never gonna stop until I make ‘em
Drop and burn ‘em up and scatter their remains, I'm

[COMPANY]
Lafayette!

[LAFAYETTE]
Watch me engagin' em! Escapin' em!
Enragin' em! I'm-

[COMPANY]
Lafayette!

[LAFAYETTE]
I go to France for more funds

[COMPANY]
Lafayette!

[LAFAYETTE]
I come back with more

[LAFAYETTE AND ENSEMBLE]
Guns
And ships
And so the balance shifts

[WASHINGTON]
We rendezvous with Rochambeau, consolidate their gifts

[LAFAYETTE]
We can end this war at Yorktown, cut them off at sea, but
For this to succeed, there's someone else we need:

[WASHINGTON]
I know

[WASHINGTON AND COMPANY]
Hamilton!

[LAFAYETTE]
Sir, he knows what to do in a trench
Ingenuitive and fluent in French, ami-

[WASHINGTON AND COMPANY]
Hamilton!

[LAFAYETTE]
Sir, you're gonna have to use him eventually
What's he gonna do on the bench? I mean-

[WASHINGTON AND COMPANY]
Hamilton!

[LAFAYETTE]
No one has more resilience
Or matches my practical tactical brilliance-

[WASHINGTON AND COMPANY]
Hamilton!
[LAFAYETTE]
You wanna fight for your land back?

[WASHINGTON]
I need my right hand man back!

[LAFAYETTE]
Ah! Uh, get ya right hand man back
You know you gotta get ya right hand man back

I mean you gotta put some thought into the letter but the sooner the better
To get your right hand man back!

[COMPANY]
Hamilton!

[WOMEN]
Hamilton!

Hamilton!

Hamilton, Hamilton!
Ha- ha-!

[MEN]
Get your right hand man back!

Your right hand man back!

Hamilton!
Ha-
Ha-

Hamilton, Hamilton!
Ha- ha-!

[WASHINGTON]
Alexander Hamilton
Troops are waiting in the field for you
If you join us right now, together we can turn the tide
Oh, Alexander Hamilton
I have soldiers who will yield for you
If we manage to get this right
They'll surrender by early light
The world will never be the same, Alexander...

History Has Its Eyes On You

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[WASHINGTON]
I was younger than you are now
When I was given my first command
I led my men straight into a massacre
I witnessed their deaths firsthand
I made every mistake
I felt the shame rise in me
And even now I lie awake
[WASHINGTON]
Knowing history has its eyes on me

[HAMILTON/WASHINGTON]
History has its eyes on me. [LAURENS/MULLIGAN]
Whoa...
Whoa...
Whoa...
Yeah

[COMPANY]
Whoa...
Whoa...
Whoa...
Yeah

[WASHINGTON]
Let me tell you what I wish I'd known
When I was young and dreamed of glory:
You have no control:

[WASHINGTON AND COMPANY]
Who lives, who dies, who tells your story

[WASHINGTON]
I know that we can win
I know that greatness lies in you
But remember from here on in
[WASHINGTON/HAMILTON AND MEN]
History has its
Eyes on you.

[ENSEMBLE]
Whoa...

Yorktown (The World Turned Upside Down)

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[COMPANY]
The battle of Yorktown. 1781

[LAFAYETTE]
Monsieur Hamilton

[HAMILTON]
Monsieur Lafayette

[LAFAYETTE]
In command where you belong

[HAMILTON]
How you say, no sweat
We're finally on the field. We've had quite a run

[LAFAYETTE]
Immigrants:

[HAMILTON/LAFAYETTE]
We get the job done

[HAMILTON]
So what happens if we win?

[LAFAYETTE]
I go back to France
I bring freedom to my people if I'm given the chance

[HAMILTON]
We'll be with you when you do

[LAFAYETTE]
Go lead your men

[HAMILTON]
See you on the other side

[LAFAYETTE]
‘Til we meet again, let's go!

[ENSEMBLE]
I am not throwin' away my shot!
I am not throwin' away my shot!
Hey yo, I'm just like my country, I'm young
Scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwin' away my shot!
I am not throwin' away my shot!

[HAMILTON]
‘Til the world turns upside down...

[ENSEMBLE]
‘Til the world turns upside down!

[HAMILTON]
I imagine death so much it feels more like a memory
This is where it gets me: on my feet
The enemy ahead of me
If this is the end of me, at least I have a friend with me
Weapon in my hand, a command, and my men with me
Then I remember my Eliza's expecting me...
Not only that, my Eliza's expecting
We gotta go, gotta get the job done
Gotta start a new nation, gotta meet my son!
Take the bullets out your gun!

[ENSEMBLE]
What?

[HAMILTON]
The bullets out your gun!

[ENSEMBLE]
What?

[HAMILTON]
We move under cover and we move as one
Through the night, we have one shot to live another day
We cannot let a stray gunshot give us away
We will fight up close, seize the moment and stay in it
It's either that or meet the business end of a bayonet
The code word is ‘Rochambeau,' dig me?

[ENSEMBLE]
Rochambeau!

[HAMILTON]
You have your orders now, go, man, go!
And so the American experiment begins
With my friends all scattered to the winds
Laurens is in South Carolina, redefining brav'ry

[HAMILTON/LAURENS]
We'll never be free until we end slavery!

[HAMILTON]
When we finally drive the British away
Lafayette is there waiting-

[HAMILTON/LAFAYETTE]
In Chesapeake Bay!

[HAMILTON]
How did we know that this plan would work?
We had a spy on the inside. That's right

[HAMILTON/COMPANY]
Hercules Mulligan!

[MULLIGAN]
A tailor spyin' on the British government!
I take their measurements, information and then I smuggle it

[COMPANY]
Up

[MULLIGAN]
To my brother's revolutionary covenant
I'm runnin' with the Sons of Liberty and I am lovin' it!
See, that's what happens when you up against the ruffians
We in the shit now, somebody gotta shovel it!
Hercules Mulligan, I need no introduction
When you knock me down I get the fuck back up again!

[COMPANY]
Left! Right! Hold!
Go!
What! What! What!

[HAMILTON]
After a week of fighting, a young man in a red coat stands on a parapet

[LAFAYETTE]
We lower our guns as he frantically waves a white handkerchief

[MULLIGAN]
And just like that, it's over. We tend to our wounded, we count our dead

[LAURENS]
Black and white soldiers wonder alike if this really means freedom

[WASHINGTON]
Not. Yet

[HAMILTON]
We negotiate the terms of surrender
I see George Washington smile
We escort their men out of Yorktown
They stagger home single file
Tens of thousands of people flood the streets
There are screams and church bells ringing
And as our fallen foes retreat
I hear the drinking song they're singing...

[ALL MEN]
The world turned upside down

[FULL COMPANY]
The world turned upside down
The world turned upside down
The world turned upside down
Down
Down, down, down

[LAFAYETTE]
Freedom for America, freedom for France!

[COMPANY]
Down, down, down

[HAMILTON]
Gotta start a new nation
Gotta meet my son

[COMPANY]
Down, down, down

[MULLIGAN]
We won!

[LAFAYETTE]
We won!

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE/LAURENS]
We won!

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE/LAURENS/HAMILTON/WASHINGTON]
We won!

What Comes Next

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[KING GEORGE]
They say
The price of my war's not a price that they're willing to pay
Insane
You cheat with the French, now I'm fighting with France and with Spain
I'm so blue
I thought that we'd made an arrangement
When you went away
You were mine to subdue
Well, even despite our estrangement, I've got
A small query for you:

What comes next?
You've been freed
Do you know how hard it is to lead?

You're on your own
Awesome. Wow
Do you have a clue what happens now?

Oceans rise
Empires fall
It's much harder when it's all your call

All alone, across the sea
When your people say they hate you, don't
Come crawling back to me

Da da da dat da dat da da da
Da ya da
Da da dat
Da da ya da...

You're on your own...

Dear Theodosia

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[BURR]
Dear Theodosia, what to say to you?
You have my eyes. You have your mother's name

When you came into the world, you cried and it broke my heart

I'm dedicating every day to you
Domestic life was never quite my style
When you smile, you knock me out, I fall apart
And I thought I was so smart

You will come of age with our young nation
We'll bleed and fight for you, we'll make it right for you
If we lay a strong enough foundation
We'll pass it on to you, we'll give the world to you
And you'll blow us all away...
Someday, someday
Yeah, you'll blow us all away
Someday, someday

[HAMILTON]
Oh Philip, when you smile I am undone
My son
Look at my son. Pride is not the word I'm looking for

There is so much more inside me now
Oh Philip, you outshine the morning sun
My son
When you smile, I fall apart
And I thought I was so smart
My father wasn't around

[BURR]
My father wasn't around
[HAMILTON]
I swear that
I'll be around for you.
[BURR]
I'll be around for you.

[HAMILTON]
I'll do whatever it takes

[BURR]
I'll make a million mistakes

[BURR/HAMILTON]
I'll make the world safe and sound for you...
...will come of age with our young nation
We'll bleed and fight for you, we'll make it right for you

If we lay a strong enough foundation
We'll pass it on to you, we'll give the world to you
And you'll blow us all away...
Someday, someday
Yeah, you'll blow us all away
Someday, someday

[BURR]
I finished up my studies and I practiced law

[HAMILTON]
I practiced law, Burr worked next door
[BURR]
Even though we started at the very same time
Alexander Hamilton began to climb
How to account for his rise to the top?
Maaaaan, the man is
Non-stop!

[ENSEMBLE]
Non-stop!

[HAMILTON]
Gentlemen of the jury, I'm curious, bear with me
Are you aware that we're making hist'ry?
This is the first murder trial of our brand-new nation
[HAMILTON]
The liberty behind
Deliberation-

[ENSEMBLE]
Non-stop!

[HAMILTON]
I intend to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt
With my assistant counsel-

[BURR]
Co-counsel
Hamilton, sit down
Our client Levi Weeks is innocent. Call your first witness
That's all you had to say!

[HAMILTON]
Okay!
One more thing-

[BURR]
Why do you assume you're the smartest in the room?
Why do you assume you're the smartest in the room?
Why do you assume you're the smartest in the room?
Soon that attitude may be your doom!

[ENSEMBLE]
Awwww!

[BURR]
Why do you write like you're running out of time?
Write day and night like you're running out of time?
Ev'ry day you fight, like you're running out of time

Keep on fighting. In the meantime- [ENSEMBLE]
Why do you write like you're running out of time?

Ev'ry day you fight, like you're running out of time

Non-stop!

[HAMILTON]
Corruption's such an old song that we can sing along in harmony
And nowhere is it stronger than in Albany
This colony's economy's increasingly stalling and

[HAMILTON]
Honestly, that's why public service
Seems to be calling me.

[BURR AND ENSEMBLE]
He's just
Non-stop!

[HAMILTON]
I practiced the law, I practic'ly perfected it
I've seen injustice in the world and I've corrected it
Now for a strong central democracy
If not, then I'll be Socrates
[HAMILTON]
Throwing verbal rocks
At these mediocrities.

[ENSEMBLE]
Awww!

[BURR]
Hamilton, at the Constitutional Convention:

[HAMILTON]
I was chosen for the Constitutional Convention

[BURR]
There as a New York junior delegate:
[HAMILTON]
Now what I'm going to say may sound indelicate...

[BURR]
Goes and proposes his own form of government!

His own plan for a new form of government!

[COMPANY]
Awwww!

What?

What?

[BURR]
Talks for six hours! The convention is listless!

[ENSEMBLE MAN]
Bright young man...

[ANOTHER ENSEMBLE MAN]
Yo, who the f is this?

[BURR]
Why do you always say what you believe?
Why do you always say what you believe?
Ev'ry proclamation guarantees free ammunition for your enemies!

[BURR AND MEN]
Why do you write like it's
Going out of style?
Write day and night like it's
Going out of style?

[COMPANY]
Why do you always say what you believe?
Awww!

[ALL WOMEN]
Going out of style, hey!
Going out of style, hey!

[BURR AND COMPANY]
Ev'ry day you fight like it's
Going out of style
Do what you do

[BURR]
Alexander?

[HAMILTON]
Aaron Burr, sir

[BURR]
It's the middle of the night

[HAMILTON]
Can we confer, sir?

[BURR]
Is this a legal matter?

HAMILTON
Yes, and it's important to me

[BURR]
What do you need?

[HAMILTON]
Burr, you're a better lawyer than me

[BURR]
Okay

[HAMILTON]
I know I talk too much, I'm abrasive
You're incredible in court. You're succinct, persuasive
My client needs a strong defense. You're the solution

[BURR]
Who's your client?

[HAMILTON]
The new U.S. Constitution?

[BURR]
No

[HAMILTON]
Hear me out

[BURR]
No way!

[HAMILTON]
A series of essays, anonymously published
Defending the document to the public

[BURR]
No one will read it

[HAMILTON]
I disagree

[BURR]
And if it fails?

[HAMILTON]
Burr, that's why we need it

[BURR]
The constitution's a mess

[HAMILTON]
So it needs amendments

[BURR]
It's full of contradictions

[HAMILTON]
So is independence
We have to start somewhere

[BURR]
No. No way

[HAMILTON]
You're making a mistake

[BURR]
Good night

[HAMILTON]
Hey
What are you waiting for?
What do you stall for?

[BURR]
What?

[HAMILTON]
We won the war
What was it all for?
Do you support this constitution?

[BURR]
Of course

[HAMILTON]
Then defend it

[BURR]
And what if you're backing the wrong horse?

[HAMILTON]
Burr, we studied and we fought and we killed
For the notion of a nation we now get to build
For once in your life, take a stand with pride
I don't understand how you stand to the side

[BURR]
I'll keep all my plans
Close to my chest

I'll wait here and see
Which way the wind
Will blow
I'm taking my time
Watching the
Afterbirth of a nation
Watching the tension grow.

[ENSEMBLE]
Wait for it, wait for
It, wait...

Which way the wind
Will blow
I'm taking my time
Watching the
Afterbirth of a nation
Watching the tension grow.

[ANGELICA]
I am sailing off to London. I'm accompanied by someone
Who always pays
I have found a wealthy husband who will keep
Me in comfort for all my days
He is not a lot of fun, but there's no one who
Can match you for turn of phrase
My Alexander

[HAMILTON]
Angelica

[ANGELICA]
Don't forget to write

[ELIZA]
Look at where you are
Look at where you started
The fact that you're alive is a miracle
Just stay alive, that would be enough
And if your wife could share a fraction of your time
If I could grant you peace of mind
Would that be enough?

[BURR]
Alexander joins forces with James Madison and John Jay to write a series of essays defending the new United States Constitution, entitled The Federalist Papers. The plan was to write a total of twenty-five essays, the work divided evenly among the three men. In the end, they wrote eighty-five essays, in the span of six months. John Jay got sick after writing five. James Madison wrote twenty-nine. Hamilton wrote the other fifty-one!

[BURR]
How do you write like you're
Running out of time?
Write day and night like you're
Running out of time?

[BURR AND MEN]
Ev'ry day you fight
Like you're
Running out of time
Like you're
Running out of time
Are you
Running out of time?
[ALL WOMEN]
Running out of time?
Running out of time?
Running out of time
Running out of time
Awwww!

[FULL COMPANY (EXCEPT HAMILTON)]
How do you write like tomorrow won't arrive?
How do you write like you need it to survive?
How do you write ev'ry second you're alive?
Ev'ry second you're alive? Ev'ry second you're alive?

[WASHINGTON]
They are asking me to lead
I am doing the best I can
To get the people that I need
I'm asking you to be my right hand man

[HAMILTON]
Treasury or State?

[WASHINGTON]
I know it's a lot to ask

[HAMILTON]
Treasury or State?

[WASHINGTON]
To leave behind the world you know...

[HAMILTON]
Sir, do you want me to run the Treasury or State department?

[WASHINGTON]
Treasury

[HAMILTON]
Let's go

[ELIZA]
Alexander...

[HAMILTON]
I have to leave

[ELIZA]
Alexander-

[HAMILTON]
Look around, look around at how lucky we are to be alive right now

[ELIZA]
Helpless...

[HAMILTON]
They are asking me to lead

[ELIZA]
Look around, isn't this enough?

How does a bastard, orphan, son of a whore and a
Scotsman, dropped in the middle of a
Forgotten spot in the Caribbean by providence
Impoverished, in squalor
Grow up to be a hero and a scholar?

[LAURENS]
The ten-dollar founding father without a father
Got a lot farther by working a lot harder
By being a lot smarter
By being a self-starter
By fourteen, they placed him in charge of a
Trading charter

[JEFFERSON]
And every day while slaves were being slaughtered and carted
Away across the waves, he struggled and kept his guard up
Inside, he was longing for something to be a part of
The brother was ready to beg, steal, borrow, or barter

[MADISON]
Then a hurricane came, and devastation reigned
Our man saw his future drip, dripping down the drain
Put a pencil to his temple, connected it to his brain
And he wrote his first refrain, a testament to his pain

[BURR]
Well, the word got around, they said, "This kid is insane, man"
Took up a collection just to send him to the mainland
"Get your education, don't forget from whence you came, and
The world is gonna know your name. What's your name, man?"

[HAMILTON]
Alexander Hamilton
My name is Alexander Hamilton
And there's a million things I haven't done
But just you wait, just you wait...

[ELIZA]
When he was ten his father split, full of it, debt-ridden
Two years later, see Alex and his mother bed-ridden
Half-dead sittin in their own sick, the scent thick

[COMPANY]
And Alex got better but his mother went quick

[WASHINGTON]
Moved in with a cousin, the cousin committed suicide
Left him with nothin' but ruined pride, something new inside
A voice saying
[WASHINGTON]
"You gotta fend for yourself." [COMPANY]
"Alex, you gotta fend for yourself."

[WASHINGTON]
He started retreatin' and readin' every treatise on the shelf
[BURR]
There would have been nothin' left to do
For someone less astute
He woulda been dead or destitute
Without a cent of restitution
Started workin', clerkin' for his late mother's landlord
Tradin' sugar cane and rum and all the things he can't afford
Scammin' for every book he can get his hands on
Plannin' for the future see him now as he stands on
The bow of a ship headed for a new land
In New York you can be a new man

[COMPANY]
In New York you can
Be a new man-
In New York you can
Be a new man-

Scammin'

Plannin'
Oooh...

Just you wait!

In New York you can be a new man-

We are waiting in the wings for you

You could never back down
You never learned to take your time!

Oh, Alexander Hamilton

When America sings for you
Will they know what you overcame?
Will they know you rewrote the game?
The world will never be the same, oh

[BURR]
The ship is in the harbor now
See if you can spot him

Another immigrant
Comin' up from the bottom

His enemies destroyed his rep
America forgot him

Alexander Hamilton

Waiting in the wings for you

You never learned to take your time!

Oh, Alexander Hamilton

America sings for you

Just you wait

We fought with him

[LAURENS]
Me? I died for him

[WASHINGTON]
Me? I trusted him

[ELIZA/ANGELICA/MARIA]
Me? I loved him

[BURR]
And me? I'm the damn fool that shot him

There's a million things I haven't done
But just you wait!

What's your name, man?

Aaron Burr, Sir

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[COMPANY]
1776. New York City

[HAMILTON]
Pardon me. Are you Aaron Burr, sir?

[BURR]
That depends. Who's asking?

[HAMILTON]
Oh, well, sure, sir
I'm Alexander Hamilton, I'm at your service, sir
I have been looking for you

[BURR]
I'm getting nervous

[HAMILTON]
Sir...
I heard your name at Princeton. I was seeking an accelerated course of study when I got sort of out of sorts with a buddy of yours. I may have punched him. It's a blur, sir. He handles the financials?

[BURR]
You punched the bursar

[HAMILTON]
Yes!
I wanted to do what you did. Graduate in two, then join the revolution. He looked at me like I was stupid, I'm not stupid

So how'd you do it? How'd you graduate so fast?

[BURR]
It was my parents' dying wish before they passed

[HAMILTON]
You're an orphan. Of course! I'm an orphan
God, I wish there was a war!
Then we could prove that we're worth more
Than anyone bargained for...

[BURR]
Can I buy you a drink?

[HAMILTON]
That would be nice

[BURR]
While we're talking, let me offer you some free advice
Talk less

[HAMILTON]
What?

[BURR]
Smile more

[HAMILTON]
Ha

[BURR]
Don't let them know what you're against or what you're for

[HAMILTON]
You can't be serious

[BURR]
You wanna get ahead?

[HAMILTON]
Yes

[BURR]
Fools who run their mouths off wind up dead

[LAURENS]
Yo yo yo yo yo!
What time is it?

[LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
Show time!

[BURR]
...like I said...

[LAURENS]
Show time! Show time! Yo!
I'm John Laurens in the place to be!
Two pints o' Sam Adams, but I'm workin' on three, uh!
Those redcoats don't want it with me!
Cuz I will pop chick-a pop these cops till I'm free!

[LAFAYETTE]
Oui oui, mon ami, je m'appelle Lafayette!
The Lancelot of the revolutionary set!
I came from afar just to say "Bonsoir!"
Tell the King "Casse toi!" Who's the best?
C'est moi!

[MULLIGAN]
Brrrah brraaah! I am Hercules Mulligan
Up in it, lovin' it, yes I heard ya mother said "Come again?"
Lock up ya daughters and horses, of course
It's hard to have intercourse over four sets of corsets...

[LAURENS]
No more sex, pour me another brew, son!
Let's raise a couple more...

[LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
To the revolution!

[LAURENS]
Well, if it ain't the prodigy of Princeton college!

[MULLIGAN]
Aaron Burr!

[LAURENS]
Give us a verse, drop some knowledge!

[BURR]
Good luck with that: you're takin' a stand
You spit. I'm ‘a sit. We'll see where we land

[LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
Boooo!

[LAURENS]
Burr, the revolution's imminent. What do you stall for?

[HAMILTON]
If you stand for nothing, Burr, what'll you fall for?
[LAURENS]
Ooh
Who are you? [MULLIGAN]
Ooh

Who are you? [LAFAYETTE]
Ooh

Who are you?

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE/LAURENS]
Ooh, who is this kid? What's he gonna do?

My Shot

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[HAMILTON]
I am not throwing away my shot!
I am not throwing away my shot!
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot!
I'm ‘a get a scholarship to King's College
I prob'ly shouldn't brag, but dag, I amaze and astonish
The problem is I got a lot of brains but no polish
I gotta holler just to be heard
With every word, I drop knowledge!
I'm a diamond in the rough, a shiny piece of coal
Tryin' to reach my goal. My power of speech: unimpeachable
Only nineteen but my mind is older
These New York City streets get colder, I shoulder
Ev'ry burden, ev'ry disadvantage
I have learned to manage, I don't have a gun to brandish
I walk these streets famished
The plan is to fan this spark into a flame
But damn, it's getting dark, so let me spell out the name
I am the-

[HAMILTON/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN/LAURENS]
A-L-E-X-A-N-D
E-R-we are-meant to be...

[HAMILTON]
A colony that runs independently
Meanwhile, Britain keeps shittin' on us endlessly
Essentially, they tax us relentlessly
Then King George turns around, runs a spending spree
He ain't ever gonna set his descendants free
So there will be a revolution in this century
Enter me!

[LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN/LAURENS]
(He says in parentheses)

[HAMILTON]
Don't be shocked when your hist'ry book mentions me
I will lay down my life if it sets us free
Eventually, you'll see my ascendancy
[HAMILTON]
And I am not throwing away
My shot
I am not throwing away
My shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot
[LAURENS]
My shot!

My shot!

And I'm not throwing away my shot.

[HAMILTON/MULLIGAN/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE]
I am not throwing away my shot
I am not throwing away my shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot
It's time to take a shot!

[LAFAYETTE]
I dream of life without a monarchy
The unrest in France will lead to ‘onarchy?
‘Onarchy? How you say, how you say, ‘anarchy?'
When I fight, I make the other side panicky
With my-

[HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
Shot!

[MULLIGAN]
Yo, I'm a tailor's apprentice
And I got y'all knuckleheads in loco parentis
I'm joining the rebellion cuz I know it's my chance
To socially advance, instead of sewin' some pants!
I'm gonna take a-

[HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
Shot!

[LAURENS]
But we'll never be truly free
Until those in bondage have the same rights as you and me
You and I. Do or die. Wait till I sally in
On a stallion with the first black battalion
Have another-

[HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
Shot!

[BURR]
Geniuses, lower your voices
You keep out of trouble and you double your choices
I'm with you, but the situation is fraught
You've got to be carefully taught:
If you talk, you're gonna get shot!

[HAMILTON]
Burr, check what we got
Mister Lafayette, hard rock like Lancelot
I think your pants look hot
Laurens, I like you a lot
Let's hatch a plot blacker than the kettle callin' the pot...
What are the odds the gods would put us all in one spot
Poppin' a squat on conventional wisdom, like it or not
A bunch of revolutionary manumission abolitionists?
Give me a position, show me where the ammunition is!

Oh, am I talkin' too loud?
Sometimes I get over excited, shoot off at the mouth
I never had a group of friends before
I promise that I'll make y'all proud

[LAURENS]
Let's get this guy in front of a crowd

[HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN/ENSEMBLE]
I am not throwing away my shot
I am not throwing away my shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot

I am not throwing away my shot
I am not throwing away my shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot
[LAURENS]
Ev'rybody sing:
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Hey!
Whoa!
Wooh!!
Whoa!
Ay, let ‘em hear ya!

Let's go!

I said shout it to the rooftops!

[HAMILTON]
I imagine death so much it feels more like a memory
When's it gonna get me?
In my sleep? Seven feet ahead of me?
If I see it comin', do I run or do I let it be?
Is it like a beat without a melody?
See, I never thought I'd live past twenty
Where I come from some get half as many
Ask anybody why we livin' fast and we laugh, reach for a flask
We have to make this moment last, that's plenty

Scratch that
This is not a moment, it's the movement
Where all the hungriest brothers with
Something to prove went?
Foes oppose us, we take an honest stand
We roll like Moses, claimin' our promised land
And? If we win our independence?
‘Zat a guarantee of freedom for our descendants?
Or will the blood we shed begin an endless
Cycle of vengeance and death with no defendants?
I know the action in the street is excitin'
But Jesus, between all the bleedin' ‘n fightin'
I've been readin' ‘n writin'
We need to handle our financial situation
Are we a nation of states? What's the state of our nation?
I'm past patiently waitin'. I'm passionately
Smashin' every expectation
Every action's an act of creation!
I'm laughin' in the face of casualties and sorrow
For the first time, I'm thinkin' past tomorrow

[HAMILTON AND COMPANY]

Schuyler Sisters

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[BURR]
There's nothing rich folks love more
Than going downtown and slummin' it with the poor
They pull up in their carriages and gawk
At the students in the common
Just to watch them talk
Take Philip Schuyler: the man is loaded
Uh-oh, but little does he know that
His daughters, Peggy, Angelica, Eliza
Sneak into the city just to watch all the guys at-

[COMPANY]
Work, work!

[ANGELICA]

Daddy doesn't need to know

It's bad enough daddy wants to go to war

Wooh! There's nothin' like summer in the city
Someone in a rush next to someone lookin' pretty
Excuse me, miss, I know it's not funny
But your perfume smells like your daddy's got money
Why you slummin' in the city in your fancy heels
You searchin for an urchin who can give you ideals?

[ANGELICA]
Burr, you disgust me

[BURR]
Ah, so you've discussed me
I'm a trust fund, baby, you can trust me!

[ANGELICA]
I've been reading Common Sense by Thomas Paine
So men say that I'm intense or I'm insane
You want a revolution? I want a revelation
So listen to my declaration:

That all men are created equal"

Farmer Refuted

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[SEABURY]
Hear ye, hear ye! My name is Samuel Seabury
And I present "Free Thoughts on the
Proceedings of the Continental Congress!"
Heed not the rabble who scream revolution
They have not your interests at heart

[MULLIGAN]
Oh my God. Tear this dude apart

[SEABURY]
Chaos and bloodshed are not a solution
Don't let them lead you astray
This Congress does not speak for me

[BURR]
Let him be

[SEABURY]
They're playing a dangerous game
I pray the king shows you his mercy
For shame, for shame...
[HAMILTON]
Yo!
He'd have you all unravel at the
Sound of screams but the
Revolution is comin'
The have-nots are gonna
Win this
It's hard to listen to you with a straight face

Chaos and bloodshed already haunt us, honestly you shouldn't even talk. And what about Boston? Look at the cost, n' all that we've lost n' you talk
About Congress?!

My dog speaks more eloquently than thee!

But strangely, your mange is the same

Is he in Jersey?

For the revolution!
[SEABURY]
Heed not the rabble
Who scream
Revolution, they
Have not your
Interests
At heart

Chaos and bloodshed are
Not a
Solution. Don't
Let them lead you
Astray
This Congress does not
Speak for me

They're playing a dangerous game

I pray the king shows you his mercy

For shame

For shame,

[COMPANY]
For the revolution!

[SEABURY]
Heed-

[HAMILTON]
If you repeat yourself again I'm gonna-

[SEABURY/HAMILTON]
Scream-

[HAMILTON]
Honestly, look at me, please don't read!

[SEABURY]
Not your interests-

[HAMILTON]
Don't modulate the key then not debate with me!
Why should a tiny island across the sea regulate the price of tea?

[BURR]
Alexander, please!

[HAMILTON]
Burr, I'd rather be divisive than indecisive, drop the niceties

[ENSEMBLE]
Silence! A message from the King!
A message from the King!

You'll Be Back

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[KING GEORGE]
You say
The price of my love's not a price that you're willing to pay
You cry
In your tea which you hurl in the sea when you see me go by
Why so sad?
Remember we made an arrangement when you went away
Now you're making me mad
Remember, despite our estrangement, I'm your man
You'll be back
Soon you'll see
You'll remember you belong to me
You'll be back
Time will tell
You'll remember that I served you well
Oceans rise
Empires fall
We have seen each other through it all
And when push
Comes to shove
I will send a fully armed battalion
To remind you of my love!

Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da
Da da dat dat da ya da!
Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da
Da da dat dat da...

You say our love is draining and you can't go on
You'll be the one complaining when I am gone...
And no, don't change the subject
Cuz you're my favorite subject
My sweet, submissive subject
My loyal, royal subject
Forever and ever and ever and ever and ever...

You'll be back
Like before
I will fight the fight and win the war
For your love
For your praise
And I'll love you till my dying days
When you're gone
I'll go mad
So don't throw away this thing we had

Cuz when push comes to shove
I will kill your friends and family to remind you of my love
Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da
Da da dat dat da ya da!
Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da
Da da dat-
Everybody!

[ENSEMBLE]
Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da
Da da dat dat da ya da!
Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da da da da
Dat dat da ya da!

As a kid in the Caribbean I wished for a war
I knew that I was poor
I knew it was the only way to-

[HAMILTON/BURR/MULLIGAN/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE]
Rise up!

[HAMILTON]
If they tell my story
I am either gonna die on the battlefield in glory or-

[HAMILTON/BURR/MULLIGAN/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE]
Rise up!

[HAMILTON]
We will fight for this land
But there's only one man
Who can give us a command so we can-

[HAMILTON/BURR/MULLIGAN/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE]
Rise up!

[HAMILTON]
Understand? It's the only way to-

[HAMILTON/BURR/MULLIGAN/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE]

We gotta make an all out stand
Ayo, I'm gonna need a right-hand man.
ENSEMBLE
What?

What?

Buck, buck, buck, buck, buck!

Buck, buck, buck, buck, buck!

[WASHINGTON]
Check it-
Can I be real a second?
For just a millisecond?
Let down my guard and tell the people how I feel a second?
Now I'm the model of a modern major general
The venerated Virginian veteran whose men are all
Lining up, to put me up on a pedestal
Writin' letters to relatives
Embellishin' my elegance and eloquence
But the elephant is in the room
The truth is in ya face when ya hear the British cannons go...

[ENSEMBLE]
Boom!

[WASHINGTON]
Any hope of success is fleeting
How can I keep leading when the people I'm
Leading keep retreating?
We put a stop to the bleeding as the British take Brooklyn
Knight takes rook, but look
[WASHINGTON]
We are outgunned

Outmanned

Outnumbered
Outplanned

We gotta make an all out stand
Ayo, I'm gonna need a right-hand man

Incoming!
[ENSEMBLE]
What?

Buck, buck, buck, buck, buck!

Buck, buck, buck, buck, buck!

They're battering down the Battery check the damages

[MULLIGAN]

[HAMILTON]
We gotta stop ‘em and rob ‘em of their advantages

[MULLIGAN]
Rah!

[HAMILTON]
Let's take a stand with the stamina God has granted us
Hamilton won't abandon ship
Yo, let's steal their cannons-
[MULLIGAN]
Shh-boom! [COMPANY]
Boom!

[WASHINGTON]
Goes the cannon, watch the blood and the shit spray and...

[COMPANY]
Boom!

[WASHINGTON]
Goes the cannon, we're abandonin' Kips Bay and...

[COMPANY]
Boom!

[WASHINGTON]
There's another ship and...

[COMPANY]
Boom!

[WASHINGTON]
We just lost the southern tip and...

[COMPANY]
Boom!

[WASHINGTON]
We gotta run to Harlem quick, we can't afford another slip
Guns and horses giddyup
I decide to divvy up
My forces, they're skittish as the British cut the city up
This close to giving up, facing mad scrutiny
I scream in the face of this mass mutiny:
Are these the men with which I am to defend America?
We ride at midnight, Manhattan in the distance
I cannot be everywhere at once, people
I'm in dire need of assistance...

[BURR]
Your excellency, sir!

[WASHINGTON]
Who are you?

[BURR]
Aaron Burr, Sir?
Permission to state my case?

[WASHINGTON]
As you were

[BURR]
Sir
I was a captain under General Montgomery
Until he caught a bullet in the neck in Quebec
And well, in summary
I think that I could be of some assistance
I admire how you keep firing on the British
From a distance

[WASHINGTON]
Huh

[BURR]
I have some questions, a couple of suggestions on how to fight instead of fleeing west

[WASHINGTON]
Yes?

[BURR]
Well-

[HAMILTON]
Your excellency, you wanted to see me?

[WASHINGTON]
Hamilton, come in, have you met Burr?

[HAMILTON]
Yes, sir

[HAMILTON AND BURR]
We keep meeting

[BURR]
As I was saying, sir, I look forward to seeing your strategy play out

[WASHINGTON]
Burr?

[BURR]
Sir?

[WASHINGTON]
Close the door on your way out

[HAMILTON]
Have I done something wrong, sir?

[WASHINGTON]
On the contrary
I called you here because our odds are beyond scary
Your reputation precedes you, but I have to laugh

[HAMILTON]
Sir?

[WASHINGTON]
Hamilton, how come no one can get you on their staff?

[HAMILTON]
Sir!

[WASHINGTON]
Don't get me wrong, you're a young man, of great renown
I know you stole British cannons when we were still downtown
Nathaniel Green and Henry Knox wanted to hire you...

[HAMILTON]
To be their Secretary? I don't think so

[WASHINGTON]
Why're you upset?

[HAMILTON]
I'm not-

[WASHINGTON]
It's alright, you want to fight, you've got a hunger
I was just like you when I was younger
Head full of fantasies of dyin' like a martyr?

[HAMILTON]
Yes

[WASHINGTON]
Dying is easy, young man. Living is harder

[HAMILTON]
Why are you telling me this?

[WASHINGTON]
I'm being honest
I'm working with a third of what our Congress has promised
We are a powder keg about to explode
I need someone like you to lighten the load. So?

[COMPANY (EXCEPT HAMILTON)]
I am not throwin' away my shot!
I am not throwin' away my shot!
Ayo, I'm just like my country, I'm young
Scrappy and hungry!

[HAMILTON]
I am not throwing away my shot!

[WASHINGTON]
Son

[WASHINGON AND COMPANY]
We are outgunned, outmanned!

[HAMILTON]
You need all the help you can get
I have some friends. Laurens, Mulligan
Marquis de Lafayette, okay, what else?

[WASHINGTON AND COMPANY]
Outnumbered, outplanned!

[HAMILTON]
We'll need some spies on the inside
Some King's men who might let some things slide
[HAMILTON]
I'll write to Congress and tell ‘em we need supplies, you rally the guys, master the element of surprise

I'll rise above my station, organize your information, ‘til we rise to the occasion of our new nation. Sir!

[ENSEMBLE]
Here comes the General!

[HAMILTON]
Rise up!

A Winter's Ball

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[BURR]
How does the bastard, orphan, son of a whore
Go on and on
Grow into more of a phenomenon?
Watch this obnoxious, arrogant, loudmouth bother
Be seated at the right hand of the father
Washington hires Hamilton right on sight
But Hamilton still wants to fight, not write
Now Hamilton's skill with a quill is undeniable
But what do we have in common? We're
Reliable with the

[ALL MEN]
Ladies!

[BURR]
There are so many to deflower!

[ALL MEN]
Ladies!

[BURR]
Looks! Proximity to power

[ALL MEN]

They delighted and distracted him
Martha Washington named her feral tomcat after him!

[HAMILTON]
That's true

[FULL COMPANY]
1780

[BURR]
A winter's ball
And the Schuyler sisters are the envy of all
Yo, if you can marry a sister, you're rich, son

Is it a question of if, Burr, or which one?

Helpless

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[HAMILTON/BURR/LAURENS/ALL WOMEN (EXCEPT ELIZA)]
Hey hey hey hey
[ELIZA]
Ohh, I do I do I do I
Dooo! Hey!
Ohh, I do I do I do I
Dooo! Boy you got me [ALL WOMEN]
Hey hey hey hey
Hey hey hey hey
Hey hey hey hey
Hey hey hey

[ELIZA AND WOMEN]
Helpless!
Look into your eyes, and the sky's the limit I'm helpless!
Down for the count, and I'm drownin' in ‘em

[ELIZA]
I have never been the type to try and grab the spotlight
We were at a revel with some rebels on a hot night
Laughin' at my sister as she's dazzling the room
Then you walked in and my heart went "Boom!"
Tryin' to catch your eye from the side of the ballroom
Everybody's dancin' and the band's top volume

[ELIZA AND WOMEN]
Grind to the rhythm as we wine and dine
[ELIZA]
Grab my sister, and
Whisper, "Yo, this
One's mine."

My sister made her way across the room to you
And I got nervous, thinking "What's she gonna do?"
She grabbed you by the arm, I'm thinkin' "I'm through"
Then you look back at me and suddenly I'm
Helpless!

Oh, look at those eyes

Oh!
Yeah, I'm
Helpless, I know

I'm so into you
I am so into you

I know I'm down for the count
And I'm drownin' in ‘em.

[ALL WOMEN]
Oooh

Oooh

Oooh

Oooh

Helpless!

Look into your eyes
And the sky's the limit
I'm
Helpless!
Down for the count
And I'm drownin' in ‘em

I'm helpless!

Look into your eyes
And the sky's the limit I'm helpless!

Down for the count
And I'm drownin' in ‘em.

[HAMILTON]
Where are you taking me?

[ANGELICA]
I'm about to change your life

[HAMILTON]
Then by all means, lead the way

[ELIZA]
Elizabeth Schuyler. It's a pleasure to meet you

[HAMILTON]
Schuyler?

[ANGELICA]
My sister

[ELIZA]
Thank you for all your service

[HAMILTON]
If it takes fighting a war for us to meet, it will have been worth it

[ANGELICA]
I'll leave you to it

[ELIZA AND WOMEN]
One week later

[ELIZA]
I'm writin' a letter nightly
Now my life gets better, every letter that you write me
Laughin' at my sister, cuz she wants to form a harem

[ANGELICA]
I'm just sayin', if you really loved me, you would share him
[ELIZA]
Ha!
Two weeks later
In the living room stressin'
My father's stone-faced
While you're asking for his blessin'
I'm dying inside, as
You wine
And dine
And I'm tryin' not to cry
‘cause there's nothing that your mind can't do
My father makes his way across the room
To you
I panic for a second, thinking
"we're through"
But then he shakes your hand and says
"Be true"
And you turn back to me, smiling, and I'm
Helpless!

Helpless!
Hoo!

That boy is mine
That boy is mine!

Helpless! Helpless!
Down for the count
And I'm drownin' in em

[ALL WOMEN]
Stressin'

Blessin'

Oooh

Oooh

Oooh

Oooh

Helpless!
Look into your eyes
And the sky's the

Helpless!
Down for the count
And I'm drownin' in
‘em I'm
Helpless!

Look into your eyes
And the sky's the
Limit I'm
Helpless!
Down for the count
And I'm drownin' in em

[HAMILTON]
Eliza, I don't have a dollar to my name
An acre of land, a troop to command, a dollop of fame
All I have's my honor, a tolerance for pain
A couple of college credits and my top-notch brain
Insane, your family brings out a different side of me
Peggy confides in me, Angelica tried to take a bite of me
No stress, my love for you is never in doubt
We'll get a little place in Harlem and we'll figure it out
I've been livin' without a family since I was a child
My father left, my mother died, I grew up buckwild
But I'll never forget my mother's face, that was real
And long as I'm alive, Eliza, swear to God
You'll never feel so...

[HAMILTON]
Eliza...

I've never felt so-

My life is gon' be fine cuz Eliza's in it.
[ELIZA]
I do I do I do I do!

I do I do I do I do!

Hey, yeah, yeah!

I'm down for the count
I'm-

I look into your eyes, and the sky's the limit
I'm

...drownin' in ‘em. [ALL WOMEN]
Helpless!

Helpless!

Helpless!

Down for the count
And I'm drownin' in ‘em

Helpless!

Satisfied

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[LAURENS]
Alright, alright. That's what I'm talkin' about!
Now everyone give it up for the maid of honor
Angelica Schuyler!
[ANGELICA]
A toast to the groom!

To the bride!

From your sister

Who is always by your side

To your union

And the hope that you provide

May you always...

Be satisfied.

[ALL MEN]
To the groom!
To the groom!
To the groom!

To the bride!
To the bride!

Angelica!
Angelica!
Angelica!

By your side!

To the union!
To the revolution!

You provide!
You provide!

[HAMILTON AND MEN]
Always-

Rewind-

[ALL WOMEN]
To the groom!

To the bride!

To the bride!

[ELIZA AND WOMEN]
Angelica!

By your side!

To the union!
To the revolution!

You provide!

Always-

Rewind-

[ANGELICA]
I remember that night, I just might
Regret that night for the rest of my days

I remember those soldier boys
Tripping over themselves to win our praise

I remember that dreamlike candlelight
Like a dream that you can't quite place

But Alexander, I'll never forget the first
Time I saw your face

I have never been the same
Intelligent eyes in a hunger-pang frame
And when you said "Hi," I forgot my dang name
Set my heart aflame, ev'ry part aflame

[FULL COMPANY]
This is not a game...

[HAMILTON]
You strike me as a woman who has never been satisfied

[ANGELICA]
I'm sure I don't know what you mean. You forget yourself

[HAMILTON]
You're like me. I'm never satisfied

[ANGELICA]
Is that right?

[HAMILTON]
I have never been satisfied

[ANGELICA]
My name is Angelica Schuyler

[HAMILTON]
Alexander Hamilton

[ANGELICA]
Where's your fam'ly from?

[HAMILTON]
Unimportant. There's a million things I haven't done but
Just you wait, just you wait...

[ANGELICA]
So so so-
So this is what it feels like to match wits
With someone at your level! What the hell is the catch? It's
The feeling of freedom, of seein' the light
It's Ben Franklin with a key and a kite! You see it, right?
The conversation lasted two minutes, maybe three minutes
Ev'rything we said in total agreement, it's
A dream and it's a bit of a dance
A bit of a posture, it's a bit of a stance. He's a
Bit of a flirt, but I'm ‘a give it a chance
I asked about his fam'ly, did you see his answer?
His hands started fidgeting, he looked askance?
He's penniless, he's flying by the seat of his pants

Handsome, boy, does he know it!
Peach fuzz, and he can't even grow it!
I wanna take him far away from this place
Then I turn and see my sister's face and she is...

[ELIZA]
Helpless...

[ANGELICA]
And I know she is...

[ELIZA]
Helpless...

[ANGELICA]
And her eyes are just...

[ELIZA]
Helpless...

[ANGELICA]
And I realize

[ANGELICA AND COMPANY]
Three fundamental truths at the exact same time...

[HAMILTON]
Where are you taking me?

[ANGELICA]
I'm about to change your life

[HAMILTON]
Then by all means, lead the way

[COMPANY (EXCEPT ANGELICA)]
Number one!

[ANGELICA]
I'm a girl in a world in which
My only job is to marry rich
My father has no sons so I'm the one
Who has to social climb for one
So I'm the oldest and the wittiest and the gossip in
New York City is insidious
Alexander is penniless
Ha! That doesn't mean I want him any less

[ELIZA]
Elizabeth Schuyler. It's a pleasure to meet you

[HAMILTON]
Schuyler?

[ANGELICA]
My sister

[COMPANY]
Number two!

[ANGELICA]
He's after me cuz I'm a Schuyler sister
That elevates his status, I'd
Have to be naïve to set that aside
Maybe that is why I introduce him to Eliza
Now that's his bride
Nice going, Angelica, he was right
You will never be satisfied

[ELIZA]
Thank you for all your service

[HAMILTON]
If it takes fighting a war for us to meet, it will have been worth it

[ANGELICA]
I'll leave you to it

[COMPANY]
Number three!

[ANGELICA]
I know my sister like I know my own mind
You will never find anyone as trusting or as kind
If I tell her that I love him she'd be silently resigned
He'd be mine
She would say, "I'm fine"

[ANGELICA AND COMPANY]
She'd be lying

[ANGELICA]
But when I fantasize at night
It's Alexander's eyes
As I romanticize what might
Have been if I hadn't sized him
Up so quickly
At least my dear Eliza's his wife;
At least I keep his eyes in my life...
[ANGELICA]
To the groom!

To the bride!

From your sister

Who is always by your side

To your union

And the hope that you provide

May you always

Be satisfied

And I know

She'll be happy as

His bride
And I know [ALL MEN (EXCEPT HAMILTON)]
To the groom!
To the groom!
To the groom!

To the bride!
To the bride!

Angelica!
Angelica!

By your side

To the union!
To the revolution!

You provide!

[HAMILTON AND MEN]
Always-

Be satisfied

Be satisfied

[MEN]
Be satisfied
Be satisfied
Be satisfied

Be satisfied
Be satisfied

Be satisfied
Be satisfied
Be satisfied

[ALL WOMEN (EXCEPT ELIZA)]

The Story of Tonight (Reprise)

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[LAURENS]
I may not live to see our glory!

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE]
I may not live to see our glory!

[LAURENS]
But I've seen wonders great and small

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE]
I've seen wonders great and small

[LAURENS]
‘Cause if the tomcat can get married

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE]
If Alexander can get married-

[LAURENS]
There's hope for our ass, after all!

[LAFAYETTE]
Raise a glass to freedom

[LAURENS/MULLIGAN]
Hey!
Something you will never see again!

[MULLIGAN]
No matter what she tells you

[LAFAYETTE]
Let's have another round tonight!

[LAURENS]
Raise a glass to the four of us!

[LAFAYETTE/HAMILTON]
Ho!

[MULLIGAN]
To the newly not poor of us!

[LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/HAMILTON]
Woo!

[LAFAYETTE]
We'll tell the story of tonight

[LAURENS]
Let's have another round-

[HAMILTON]
Well, if it isn't Aaron Burr

[BURR]
Sir!

[HAMILTON]
I didn't think that you would make it

[BURR]
To be sure

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE]
Burr!

[BURR]
I came to say congratulations

[MULLIGAN]
Spit a verse, Burr!

[BURR]
I see the whole gang is here

[LAFAYETTE]
You are the worst, Burr!

[HAMILTON]
Ignore them. Congrats to you, Lieutenant Colonel
I wish I had your command instead of manning George's journal

[BURR]
No, you don't

[HAMILTON]
Yes, I do

[BURR]
Now, be sensible
From what I hear, you've made yourself indispensable

[LAURENS]
Well, well, I heard
You've got a special someone on the side, Burr

[HAMILTON]
Is that so?

[LAURENS]
What are you tryin' to hide, Burr?

[BURR]
I should go

[HAMILTON]
No, these guys should go

[LAFAYETTE]
What?

[LAURENS]
No!

[HAMILTON]
Leave us alone

[MULLIGAN]
Man...

[HAMILTON]
It's alright, Burr. I wish you'd brought this girl with you tonight, Burr

[BURR]
You're very kind, but I'm afraid it's unlawful, sir

[HAMILTON]
What do you mean?

[BURR]
She's married

[HAMILTON]
I see

[BURR]
She's married to a British officer

[HAMILTON]
Oh shit...

[BURR]
Congrats again, Alexander. Smile more
I'll see you on the other side of the war

[HAMILTON]
I will never understand you
If you love this woman, go get her! What are you waiting for?

[BURR]
I'll see you on the other side of the war

[HAMILTON]
I'll see you on the other side of the war

Wait For It

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[BURR]
Theodosia writes me a letter everyday
I'm keeping the bed warm while her husband is away
He's on the British side in Georgia
He's trying to keep the colonies in line
But he can keep all of Georgia
Theodosia, she's mine

Love doesn't discriminate
Between the sinners
And the saints
It takes and it takes and it takes
And we keep loving anyway
We laugh and we cry
And we break
And we make our mistakes
And if there's a reason I'm by her side
When so many have tried
Then I'm willing to wait for it
I'm willing to wait for it
[BURR]
My grandfather was a fire and brimstone preacher

But there are things that the
Homilies and hymns won't teach ya

My mother was a genius

My father commanded respect

When they died they left no instructions
Just a legacy to protect

[MEN]
Preacher, preacher
Preacher

Teach ya, teach ya, teach ya

Respect, respect

[WOMEN]
Genius

[BURR/ENSEMBLE]
Death doesn't discriminate
Between the sinners
And the saints
It takes and it takes and it takes
And we keep living anyway
We rise and we fall
And we break
And we make our mistakes
And if there's a reason I'm still alive
When everyone who loves me has died
I'm willing to wait for it
I'm willing to wait for it

Wait for it

[ENSEMBLE]
Wait for it
Wait for it
Wait for it

[BURR]
I am the one thing in life I can control

Wait for it
Wait for it

I am inimitable
I am an original

Wait for it

[BURR]
I'm not falling behind or running late

[ENSEMBLE]
Wait for it
Wait for it

I'm not standing still
I am lying in wait

[ENSEMBLE]
Wait

[BURR]
Hamilton faces an endless uphill climb

[ENSEMBLE]
Climb
Climb
Climb

[BURR]
He has something to prove
He has nothing to lose

[ENSEMBLE]
Lose

Lose

[BURR]
Hamilton's pace is relentless
He wastes no time

[ENSEMBLE]
Time

[BURR]
What is it like in his shoes?

Hamilton doesn't hesitate
He exhibits no restraint
He takes and he takes and he takes
And he keeps winning anyway
He changes the game
He plays and he raises the stakes
And if there's a reason
He seems to thrive when so few survive, then Goddamnit-
[BURR]
I'm willing to wait for it

I'm willing to wait for it...

Life doesn't discriminate
Between the sinners and the saints
It takes and it takes and it takes

We rise
We fall

And if there's a reason I'm still alive
When so many have died
Then I'm willin' to-
[COMPANY]

Stay Alive

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[ELIZA]
Stay alive...

[ELIZA/ANGELICA/ENSEMBLE WOMEN]
Stay alive...

[HAMILTON]
I have never seen the General so despondent
I have taken over writing all his correspondence
Congress writes, "George, attack the British forces."
I shoot back, we have resorted to eating our horses
Local merchants deny us equipment, assistance
They only take British money, so sing a song of sixpence

[WASHINGTON]
The cavalry's not coming

[HAMILTON]
Sir!

[WASHINGTON]
Alex, listen. There's only one way for us to win this
Provoke outrage, outright

[HAMILTON]
That's right

[WASHINGTON]
Don't engage, strike by night
Remain relentless ‘til their troops take flight

[HAMILTON]
Make it impossible to justify the cost of the fight

[WASHINGTON]
Outrun

[HAMILTON]
Outrun

[WASHINGTON]
Outlast

[HAMILTON]
Outlast

[WASHINGTON]
Hit ‘em quick, get out fast

[HAMILTON]
Chick-a-plao!

[WASHINGTON]
Stay alive ‘til this horror show is past
We're gonna fly a lot of flags half-mast

[HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE]
Raise a glass!

[MULLIGAN]
I go back to New York and my apprenticeship

[LAFAYETTE]
I ask for French aid, I pray that France has sent a ship

[LAURENS]
I stay at work with Hamilton
We write essays against slavery
And every day's a test of our camaraderie
And bravery

[HAMILTON]
We cut supply lines, we steal contraband
We pick and choose our battles and places to take a stand
And ev'ry day
"Sir, entrust me with a command,"
And ev'ry day

[WASHINGTON]
No

[HAMILTON]
He dismisses me out of hand
[HAMILTON]
Instead of me
He promotes
Charles Lee
Makes him second-in-command:

[LEE]
Charles Lee. [ELIZA/ANGELICA]
Stay alive...

[LEE]
I'm a General. Whee!!!!

[HAMILTON]
Yeah. He's not the choice I would have gone with

[HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE]
He shits the bed at the Battle of Monmouth

[WASHINGTON]
Ev'ryone attack!

[LEE]
Retreat!

[WASHINGTON]
Attack!

[LEE]
Retreat!

[WASHINGTON]
What are you doing, Lee? Get back on your feet!

[LEE]
But there's so many of them!

[WASHINGTON]
I'm sorry, is this not your speed?!
Hamilton!

[HAMILTON]
Ready, sir!

[WASHINGTON]
Have Lafayette take the lead!

[HAMILTON]
Yes, sir!

[LAURENS]
A thousand soldiers die in a hundred degree heat

[LAFAYETTE]
As we snatch a stalemate from the jaws of defeat

[HAMILTON]
Charles Lee was left behind
Without a pot to piss in
He started sayin' this to anybody who would listen:

[LEE]
Washington cannot be left alone to his devices
Indecisive, from crisis to crisis
The best thing he can do for the revolution
Is turn n' go back to plantin' tobacco in Mount Vernon

[COMPANY]
Oo!!

[WASHINGTON]
Don't do a thing. History will prove him wrong

[HAMILTON]
But, sir!

[WASHINGTON]
We have a war to fight, let's move along

[LAURENS]
Strong words from Lee, someone oughta hold him to it

[HAMILTON]
I can't disobey direct orders

[LAURENS]
Then I'll do it
Alexander, you're the closest friend I've got

[HAMILTON]
Laurens, do not throw away your shot

Ten Duel Commandments

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[MEN]
One, two, three, four

[FULL COMPANY]
Five, six, seven, eight, nine...

[BURR/HAMILTON/LAURENS/LEE]
It's the Ten Duel Commandments

[FULL COMPANY]
It's the Ten Duel Commandments
Number one!

[LAURENS]
The challenge: demand satisfaction
If they apologize, no need for further action

[COMPANY]
Number two!

[LAURENS]
If they don't, grab a friend, that's your second

[HAMILTON]
Your lieutenant when there's reckoning to be reckoned

[COMPANY]
Number three!

[LEE]
Have your seconds meet face to face

[BURR]
Negotiate a peace...

[HAMILTON]
Or negotiate a time and place

[BURR]
This is commonplace, ‘specially ‘tween recruits

[COMPANY]
Most disputes die, and no one shoots
Number four!

[LAURENS]
If they don't reach a peace, that's alright
Time to get some pistols and a doctor on site

[HAMILTON]
You pay him in advance, you treat him with civility

[BURR]
You have him turn around so he can have deniability

[COMPANY]
Five!

[LEE]
Duel before the sun is in the sky

[COMPANY]
Pick a place to die where it's high and dry
Number six!

[HAMILTON]
Leave a note for your next of kin
Tell ‘em where you been. Pray that hell or heaven lets you in

[COMPANY]
Seven!

[LEE]
Confess your sins. Ready for the moment of adrenaline when you finally face your opponent

[COMPANY]
Number eight!

[LAURENS/LEE/HAMILTON/BURR]
Your last chance to negotiate
Send in your seconds, see if they can set the record straight...

[BURR]
Alexander

[HAMILTON]
Aaron Burr, sir

[BURR]
Can we agree that duels are dumb and immature?

[HAMILTON]
Sure
But your man has to answer for his words, Burr

[BURR]
With his life? We both know that's absurd, sir

[HAMILTON]
Hang on, how many men died because Lee was inexperienced and ruinous?

[BURR]
Okay, so we're doin' this

[COMPANY]
Number nine!

[HAMILTON]
Look ‘em in the eye, aim no higher
Summon all the courage you require
Then count

[MEN]
One two three four

[FULL COMPANY]
Five six seven eight nine

[HAMILTON/BURR]
Number

[COMPANY]
Ten paces!

[HAMILTON/BURR]
Fire!

Meet Me Inside

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[HAMILTON]
Lee, do you yield?

[BURR]
You shot him in the side!
Yes, he yields!

[LAURENS]
I'm satisfied

[BURR]
Yo, we gotta clear the field!

[HAMILTON]
Go! We won

[COMPANY]
Here comes the General!

[BURR]
This should be fun

[WASHINGTON]
What is the meaning of this? Mr. Burr, get a medic for the General

[BURR]
Yes, sir

[WASHINGTON]
Lee, you will never agree with me
But believe me, these young men don't speak for me
Thank you for your service

[BURR]
Let's ride!

[WASHINGTON]
Hamilton!

[HAMILTON]
Sir!

[WASHINGTON]
Meet me inside

[COMPANY]
Meet him inside! Meet him inside!
Meet him inside, meet him, meet him inside!

[WASHINGTON]
Son-

[HAMILTON]
Don't call me son

[WASHINGTON]
This war is hard enough
Without infighting-

[HAMILTON]
Lee called you out. We called his bluff

[WASHINGTON]
You solve nothing, you aggravate our allies to the south

[HAMILTON]
You're absolutely right, John should have shot him in the mouth
That would've shut him up

[WASHINGTON]
Son-

[HAMILTON]
I'm notcha son-

[WASHINGTON]
Watch your tone
I am not a maiden in need of defending, I am grown

[HAMILTON (OVERLAPPING)]
Charles Lee, Thomas Conway
These men take your name and they rake it
Through the mud

[WASHINGTON]
My name's been through a lot, I can take it

[HAMILTON]
Well, I don't have your name. I don't have your titles
I don't have your land
But, if you-

[WASHINGTON]
No-

[HAMILTON]
If you gave me command of a battalion, a group of men to lead, I could fly above my station after the war

[WASHINGTON]
Or you could die and we need you alive

[HAMILTON]
I'm more than willing to die-

[WASHINGTON]
Your wife needs you alive, son, I need you alive-

[HAMILTON]
Call me son one more time-

[WASHINGTON]
Go home, Alexander
That's an order from your commander

[HAMILTON]
Sir-

[WASHINGTON]
Go home

That Would Be Enough

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[ELIZA]
Look around, look around at how lucky we are
To be alive right now
Look around, look around...

[HAMILTON]
How long have you known?

[ELIZA]
A month or so

[HAMILTON]
Eliza, you should have told me

[ELIZA]
I wrote to the General a month ago

[HAMILTON]
No

[ELIZA]
I begged him to send you home

[HAMILTON]
You should have told me

[ELIZA]
I'm not sorry
[ELIZA]
I knew you'd fight
Until the war was won

But you deserve a chance to meet your son
Look around, look around at how lucky we are
To be alive right now.
[HAMILTON]
The war's not
Done.

[HAMILTON]
Will you relish being a poor man's wife
Unable to provide for your life?

[ELIZA]
I relish being your wife
Look around, look around...

Look at where you are
Look at where you started
The fact that you're alive is a miracle
Just stay alive, that would be enough

And if this child
Shares a fraction of your smile
Or a fragment of your mind, look out world!
That would be enough

I don't pretend to know
The challenges you're facing
The worlds you keep erasing and creating in your mind

But I'm not afraid
I know who I married
So long as you come home at the end of the day
That would be enough

We don't need a legacy
We don't need money
If I could grant you peace of mind

If you could let me inside your heart...
Oh, let me be a part of the narrative
In the story they will write someday
Let this moment be the first chapter:
Where you decide to stay
And I could be enough
And we could be enough
That would be enough

Guns and Ships

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[BURR]
How does a ragtag volunteer army in need of a shower
Somehow defeat a global superpower?
How do we emerge victorious from the quagmire?
Leave the battlefield waving Betsy Ross' flag higher?
Yo. Turns out we have a secret weapon!
An immigrant you know and love who's unafraid to step in!
He's constantly confusin', confoundin' the British henchmen
Ev'ryone give it up for America's favorite fighting Frenchman!

[COMPANY]
Lafayette!

[LAFAYETTE]
I'm takin this horse by the reins makin'
Redcoats redder with bloodstains

[COMPANY]
Lafayette!

[LAFAYETTE]
And I'm never gonna stop until I make ‘em
Drop and burn ‘em up and scatter their remains, I'm

[COMPANY]
Lafayette!

[LAFAYETTE]
Watch me engagin' em! Escapin' em!
Enragin' em! I'm-

[COMPANY]
Lafayette!

[LAFAYETTE]
I go to France for more funds

[COMPANY]
Lafayette!

[LAFAYETTE]
I come back with more

[LAFAYETTE AND ENSEMBLE]
Guns
And ships
And so the balance shifts

[WASHINGTON]
We rendezvous with Rochambeau, consolidate their gifts

[LAFAYETTE]
We can end this war at Yorktown, cut them off at sea, but
For this to succeed, there's someone else we need:

[WASHINGTON]
I know

[WASHINGTON AND COMPANY]
Hamilton!

[LAFAYETTE]
Sir, he knows what to do in a trench
Ingenuitive and fluent in French, ami-

[WASHINGTON AND COMPANY]
Hamilton!

[LAFAYETTE]
Sir, you're gonna have to use him eventually
What's he gonna do on the bench? I mean-

[WASHINGTON AND COMPANY]
Hamilton!

[LAFAYETTE]
No one has more resilience
Or matches my practical tactical brilliance-

[WASHINGTON AND COMPANY]
Hamilton!
[LAFAYETTE]
You wanna fight for your land back?

[WASHINGTON]
I need my right hand man back!

[LAFAYETTE]
Ah! Uh, get ya right hand man back
You know you gotta get ya right hand man back

I mean you gotta put some thought into the letter but the sooner the better
To get your right hand man back!

[COMPANY]
Hamilton!

[WOMEN]
Hamilton!

Hamilton!

Hamilton, Hamilton!
Ha- ha-!

[MEN]
Get your right hand man back!

Your right hand man back!

Hamilton!
Ha-
Ha-

Hamilton, Hamilton!
Ha- ha-!

[WASHINGTON]
Alexander Hamilton
Troops are waiting in the field for you
If you join us right now, together we can turn the tide
Oh, Alexander Hamilton
I have soldiers who will yield for you
If we manage to get this right
They'll surrender by early light
The world will never be the same, Alexander...

History Has Its Eyes On You

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[WASHINGTON]
I was younger than you are now
When I was given my first command
I led my men straight into a massacre
I witnessed their deaths firsthand
I made every mistake
I felt the shame rise in me
And even now I lie awake
[WASHINGTON]
Knowing history has its eyes on me

[HAMILTON/WASHINGTON]
History has its eyes on me. [LAURENS/MULLIGAN]
Whoa...
Whoa...
Whoa...
Yeah

[COMPANY]
Whoa...
Whoa...
Whoa...
Yeah

[WASHINGTON]
Let me tell you what I wish I'd known
When I was young and dreamed of glory:
You have no control:

[WASHINGTON AND COMPANY]
Who lives, who dies, who tells your story

[WASHINGTON]
I know that we can win
I know that greatness lies in you
But remember from here on in
[WASHINGTON/HAMILTON AND MEN]
History has its
Eyes on you.

[ENSEMBLE]
Whoa...

Yorktown (The World Turned Upside Down)

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[COMPANY]
The battle of Yorktown. 1781

[LAFAYETTE]
Monsieur Hamilton

[HAMILTON]
Monsieur Lafayette

[LAFAYETTE]
In command where you belong

[HAMILTON]
How you say, no sweat
We're finally on the field. We've had quite a run

[LAFAYETTE]
Immigrants:

[HAMILTON/LAFAYETTE]
We get the job done

[HAMILTON]
So what happens if we win?

[LAFAYETTE]
I go back to France
I bring freedom to my people if I'm given the chance

[HAMILTON]
We'll be with you when you do

[LAFAYETTE]
Go lead your men

[HAMILTON]
See you on the other side

[LAFAYETTE]
‘Til we meet again, let's go!

[ENSEMBLE]
I am not throwin' away my shot!
I am not throwin' away my shot!
Hey yo, I'm just like my country, I'm young
Scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwin' away my shot!
I am not throwin' away my shot!

[HAMILTON]
‘Til the world turns upside down...

[ENSEMBLE]
‘Til the world turns upside down!

[HAMILTON]
I imagine death so much it feels more like a memory
This is where it gets me: on my feet
The enemy ahead of me
If this is the end of me, at least I have a friend with me
Weapon in my hand, a command, and my men with me
Then I remember my Eliza's expecting me...
Not only that, my Eliza's expecting
We gotta go, gotta get the job done
Gotta start a new nation, gotta meet my son!
Take the bullets out your gun!

[ENSEMBLE]
What?

[HAMILTON]
The bullets out your gun!

[ENSEMBLE]
What?

[HAMILTON]
We move under cover and we move as one
Through the night, we have one shot to live another day
We cannot let a stray gunshot give us away
We will fight up close, seize the moment and stay in it
It's either that or meet the business end of a bayonet
The code word is ‘Rochambeau,' dig me?

[ENSEMBLE]
Rochambeau!

[HAMILTON]
You have your orders now, go, man, go!
And so the American experiment begins
With my friends all scattered to the winds
Laurens is in South Carolina, redefining brav'ry

[HAMILTON/LAURENS]
We'll never be free until we end slavery!

[HAMILTON]
When we finally drive the British away
Lafayette is there waiting-

[HAMILTON/LAFAYETTE]
In Chesapeake Bay!

[HAMILTON]
How did we know that this plan would work?
We had a spy on the inside. That's right

[HAMILTON/COMPANY]
Hercules Mulligan!

[MULLIGAN]
A tailor spyin' on the British government!
I take their measurements, information and then I smuggle it

[COMPANY]
Up

[MULLIGAN]
To my brother's revolutionary covenant
I'm runnin' with the Sons of Liberty and I am lovin' it!
See, that's what happens when you up against the ruffians
We in the shit now, somebody gotta shovel it!
Hercules Mulligan, I need no introduction
When you knock me down I get the fuck back up again!

[COMPANY]
Left! Right! Hold!
Go!
What! What! What!

[HAMILTON]
After a week of fighting, a young man in a red coat stands on a parapet

[LAFAYETTE]
We lower our guns as he frantically waves a white handkerchief

[MULLIGAN]
And just like that, it's over. We tend to our wounded, we count our dead

[LAURENS]
Black and white soldiers wonder alike if this really means freedom

[WASHINGTON]
Not. Yet

[HAMILTON]
We negotiate the terms of surrender
I see George Washington smile
We escort their men out of Yorktown
They stagger home single file
Tens of thousands of people flood the streets
There are screams and church bells ringing
And as our fallen foes retreat
I hear the drinking song they're singing...

[ALL MEN]
The world turned upside down

[FULL COMPANY]
The world turned upside down
The world turned upside down
The world turned upside down
Down
Down, down, down

[LAFAYETTE]
Freedom for America, freedom for France!

[COMPANY]
Down, down, down

[HAMILTON]
Gotta start a new nation
Gotta meet my son

[COMPANY]
Down, down, down

[MULLIGAN]
We won!

[LAFAYETTE]
We won!

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE/LAURENS]
We won!

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE/LAURENS/HAMILTON/WASHINGTON]
We won!

What Comes Next

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[KING GEORGE]
They say
The price of my war's not a price that they're willing to pay
Insane
You cheat with the French, now I'm fighting with France and with Spain
I'm so blue
I thought that we'd made an arrangement
When you went away
You were mine to subdue
Well, even despite our estrangement, I've got
A small query for you:

What comes next?
You've been freed
Do you know how hard it is to lead?

You're on your own
Awesome. Wow
Do you have a clue what happens now?

Oceans rise
Empires fall
It's much harder when it's all your call

All alone, across the sea
When your people say they hate you, don't
Come crawling back to me

Da da da dat da dat da da da
Da ya da
Da da dat
Da da ya da...

You're on your own...

Dear Theodosia

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[BURR]
Dear Theodosia, what to say to you?
You have my eyes. You have your mother's name

When you came into the world, you cried and it broke my heart

I'm dedicating every day to you
Domestic life was never quite my style
When you smile, you knock me out, I fall apart
And I thought I was so smart

You will come of age with our young nation
We'll bleed and fight for you, we'll make it right for you
If we lay a strong enough foundation
We'll pass it on to you, we'll give the world to you
And you'll blow us all away...
Someday, someday
Yeah, you'll blow us all away
Someday, someday

[HAMILTON]
Oh Philip, when you smile I am undone
My son
Look at my son. Pride is not the word I'm looking for

There is so much more inside me now
Oh Philip, you outshine the morning sun
My son
When you smile, I fall apart
And I thought I was so smart
My father wasn't around

[BURR]
My father wasn't around
[HAMILTON]
I swear that
I'll be around for you.
[BURR]
I'll be around for you.

[HAMILTON]
I'll do whatever it takes

[BURR]
I'll make a million mistakes

[BURR/HAMILTON]
I'll make the world safe and sound for you...
...will come of age with our young nation
We'll bleed and fight for you, we'll make it right for you

If we lay a strong enough foundation
We'll pass it on to you, we'll give the world to you
And you'll blow us all away...
Someday, someday
Yeah, you'll blow us all away
Someday, someday

Non-Stop

(Lin-Manuel Miranda - Hamilton Cast)

[BURR]
After the war I went back to New York

[HAMILTON]
A-After the war I went back to New York

[BURR]
I finished up my studies and I practiced law

[HAMILTON]
I practiced law, Burr worked next door
[BURR]
Even though we started at the very same time
Alexander Hamilton began to climb
How to account for his rise to the top?
Maaaaan, the man is
Non-stop!

[ENSEMBLE]
Non-stop!

[HAMILTON]
Gentlemen of the jury, I'm curious, bear with me
Are you aware that we're making hist'ry?
This is the first murder trial of our brand-new nation
[HAMILTON]
The liberty behind
Deliberation-

[ENSEMBLE]
Non-stop!

[HAMILTON]
I intend to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt
With my assistant counsel-

[BURR]
Co-counsel
Hamilton, sit down
Our client Levi Weeks is innocent. Call your first witness
That's all you had to say!

[HAMILTON]
Okay!
One more thing-

[BURR]
Why do you assume you're the smartest in the room?
Why do you assume you're the smartest in the room?
Why do you assume you're the smartest in the room?
Soon that attitude may be your doom!

[ENSEMBLE]
Awwww!

[BURR]
Why do you write like you're running out of time?
Write day and night like you're running out of time?
Ev'ry day you fight, like you're running out of time

Keep on fighting. In the meantime- [ENSEMBLE]
Why do you write like you're running out of time?

Ev'ry day you fight, like you're running out of time

Non-stop!

[HAMILTON]
Corruption's such an old song that we can sing along in harmony
And nowhere is it stronger than in Albany
This colony's economy's increasingly stalling and

[HAMILTON]
Honestly, that's why public service
Seems to be calling me.

[BURR AND ENSEMBLE]
He's just
Non-stop!

[HAMILTON]
I practiced the law, I practic'ly perfected it
I've seen injustice in the world and I've corrected it
Now for a strong central democracy
If not, then I'll be Socrates
[HAMILTON]
Throwing verbal rocks
At these mediocrities.

[ENSEMBLE]
Awww!

[BURR]
Hamilton, at the Constitutional Convention:

[HAMILTON]
I was chosen for the Constitutional Convention

[BURR]
There as a New York junior delegate:
[HAMILTON]
Now what I'm going to say may sound indelicate...

[BURR]
Goes and proposes his own form of government!

His own plan for a new form of government!

[COMPANY]
Awwww!

What?

What?

[BURR]
Talks for six hours! The convention is listless!

[ENSEMBLE MAN]
Bright young man...

[ANOTHER ENSEMBLE MAN]
Yo, who the f is this?

[BURR]
Why do you always say what you believe?
Why do you always say what you believe?
Ev'ry proclamation guarantees free ammunition for your enemies!

[BURR AND MEN]
Why do you write like it's
Going out of style?
Write day and night like it's
Going out of style?

[COMPANY]
Why do you always say what you believe?
Awww!

[ALL WOMEN]
Going out of style, hey!
Going out of style, hey!

[BURR AND COMPANY]
Ev'ry day you fight like it's
Going out of style
Do what you do

[BURR]
Alexander?

[HAMILTON]
Aaron Burr, sir

[BURR]
It's the middle of the night

[HAMILTON]
Can we confer, sir?

[BURR]
Is this a legal matter?

HAMILTON
Yes, and it's important to me

[BURR]
What do you need?

[HAMILTON]
Burr, you're a better lawyer than me

[BURR]
Okay

[HAMILTON]
I know I talk too much, I'm abrasive
You're incredible in court. You're succinct, persuasive
My client needs a strong defense. You're the solution

[BURR]
Who's your client?

[HAMILTON]
The new U.S. Constitution?

[BURR]
No

[HAMILTON]
Hear me out

[BURR]
No way!

[HAMILTON]
A series of essays, anonymously published
Defending the document to the public

[BURR]
No one will read it

[HAMILTON]
I disagree

[BURR]
And if it fails?

[HAMILTON]
Burr, that's why we need it

[BURR]
The constitution's a mess

[HAMILTON]
So it needs amendments

[BURR]
It's full of contradictions

[HAMILTON]
So is independence
We have to start somewhere

[BURR]
No. No way

[HAMILTON]
You're making a mistake

[BURR]
Good night

[HAMILTON]
Hey
What are you waiting for?
What do you stall for?

[BURR]
What?

[HAMILTON]
We won the war
What was it all for?
Do you support this constitution?

[BURR]
Of course

[HAMILTON]
Then defend it

[BURR]
And what if you're backing the wrong horse?

[HAMILTON]
Burr, we studied and we fought and we killed
For the notion of a nation we now get to build
For once in your life, take a stand with pride
I don't understand how you stand to the side

[BURR]
I'll keep all my plans
Close to my chest

I'll wait here and see
Which way the wind
Will blow
I'm taking my time
Watching the
Afterbirth of a nation
Watching the tension grow.

[ENSEMBLE]
Wait for it, wait for
It, wait...

Which way the wind
Will blow
I'm taking my time
Watching the
Afterbirth of a nation
Watching the tension grow.

[ANGELICA]
I am sailing off to London. I'm accompanied by someone
Who always pays
I have found a wealthy husband who will keep
Me in comfort for all my days
He is not a lot of fun, but there's no one who
Can match you for turn of phrase
My Alexander

[HAMILTON]
Angelica

[ANGELICA]
Don't forget to write

[ELIZA]
Look at where you are
Look at where you started
The fact that you're alive is a miracle
Just stay alive, that would be enough
And if your wife could share a fraction of your time
If I could grant you peace of mind
Would that be enough?

[BURR]
Alexander joins forces with James Madison and John Jay to write a series of essays defending the new United States Constitution, entitled The Federalist Papers. The plan was to write a total of twenty-five essays, the work divided evenly among the three men. In the end, they wrote eighty-five essays, in the span of six months. John Jay got sick after writing five. James Madison wrote twenty-nine. Hamilton wrote the other fifty-one!

[BURR]
How do you write like you're
Running out of time?
Write day and night like you're
Running out of time?

[BURR AND MEN]
Ev'ry day you fight
Like you're
Running out of time
Like you're
Running out of time
Are you
Running out of time?
[ALL WOMEN]
Running out of time?
Running out of time?
Running out of time
Running out of time
Awwww!

[FULL COMPANY (EXCEPT HAMILTON)]
How do you write like tomorrow won't arrive?
How do you write like you need it to survive?
How do you write ev'ry second you're alive?
Ev'ry second you're alive? Ev'ry second you're alive?

[WASHINGTON]
They are asking me to lead
I am doing the best I can
To get the people that I need
I'm asking you to be my right hand man

[HAMILTON]
Treasury or State?

[WASHINGTON]
I know it's a lot to ask

[HAMILTON]
Treasury or State?

[WASHINGTON]
To leave behind the world you know...

[HAMILTON]
Sir, do you want me to run the Treasury or State department?

[WASHINGTON]
Treasury

[HAMILTON]
Let's go

[ELIZA]
Alexander...

[HAMILTON]
I have to leave

[ELIZA]
Alexander-

[HAMILTON]
Look around, look around at how lucky we are to be alive right now

[ELIZA]
Helpless...

[HAMILTON]
They are asking me to lead

[ELIZA]
Look around, isn't this enough?

[ANGELICA]
He will never be satisfied
He will never be satisfied
Satisfied
Satisfied...
He will never be satisfied
Satisfied
